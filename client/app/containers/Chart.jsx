      "text": "Mersen SA (MRN) Declines -1.06% on Oct 19 \nOctober 19, 2017 - By Stephen Andrade \nShares of Mersen SA (EPA:MRN) last traded at 33.64, representing a move of -1.06%, or -0.36 per share, on volume of 6,414 shares. After opening the trading day at 33.88, shares of Mersen SA traded in a close range. Mersen SA currently has a total float of 20.50M shares and on average sees 21,959 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 17.36 and high of 35. Euronext Paris: Driving France’s Economic Prospects \nFrance is one of Europe’s pride not just in the tourism front but most importantly, in the corporate world. One of the main reasons that Europe is immensely growing as an economy today is France. Its trading relations with Mersen SA and other companies help both sides to grow further. The nation’s economic potentials cannot be undermined especially when they reflect in its own stable equity market. Euronext Paris in History \nEuronext Paris is part of a broader, pan-European stock exchange that stretches in five of the biggest European cities that include Paris, London, Lisbon, Brussels, and Amsterdam— the Euronext. It works with Mersen SA as well. Some of the main Euronext indices include the AEX, AScX, CAC 40, Next 150, among others. \nThe Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Brussels Stock Exchange, and the Paris Bourse had joined together on September 22, 2000, forming the first pan-European stock exchange. Two years later, the Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto (BVLP) had joined the Euronext. The foundation of a bigger, consolidated European stock exchange signifies the efforts of the European Union (EU) to maximize its resources and leverage better growth opportunities. Nearly two decades later and the Euronext continues to live up to its founding principle and mission— to drive the European economy towards meaningful success. \nThe CAC 40 is the free-float market capitalization-weighted index tracking the top 40 stocks on Euronext Paris. It represents a crucial aspect of the French economy as well as that of the European economy. Mersen SA had to prove its reliability to appear at the market. \nPrior to becoming a free-float market capitalization-weighted index on December 1, 2003, the CAC 40 had used to measure stocks based on overall market capitalization. Its name comes from an old automated trading system on the Euronext, CotationAssistéeenContinu. \nThe Index Steering Committee reviews the components of the CAC 40 every third Friday of March, June, September, and December. During these review dates, the Index Steering Committee limits the weights of each stock at 15%. The top 100 companies in terms of 12-month free-float market capitalization and share turnover are determined every quarter. From these 100 companies, the 40 most significant components are selected to make up the CAC 40. Euronext Paris by the Numbers \nAs of the first quarter of 2014, the Euronext already had nearly €3 trillion of market capitalization with more than 1,000 companies. \nThe CAC 40 had reached an all-time high of nearly 7,000 on September 4, 2000, a few days before the establishment of the Euronext. Meanwhile, it had posted an all-time low of below 900 in January 1988. \nThe movement on Euronext Paris is in increments of 0.50. Stocks are weighted quarterly using a base value of 1,000, which was determined on December 31, 1987. \nThe margin requirement is usually 2% while the minimum trade size requirement is one index. As part of the EU, the main trading currency on Euronext Paris is euro. \nEuronext Paris is one of the most influential stock exchanges not just in Europe but in the world as well. It boasts with stability and strong, long-term growth prospects. That being said, investing in Euronext Paris is a primary consideration among novice and experienced investors alike. Investors may be interested in Mersen SA stocks. \nAnother recent and important Mersen SA (EPA:MRN) news was published by Roanoke.com which published an article titled: “Salem manufacturer Mersen to add 50 jobs” on November 04, 2014. \nMersen SA, formerly Le Carbone Lorraine SA, is a France firm engaged in the production of carbon and graphite products and their application.

ISHARES II PLC ISHRS EUR GOVT BOND 3-5YR ETF EUR (DIST) currently has a total float of shares and on average sees 1,624 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 167.19 and high of 170.34. What Drives The Trade and Commerce In The UK \nThe UK is one of the richest nations globally. It has long been among the driving forces behind the success of the European economy. It has been always been leveraging opportunities and maximizing its capabilities to execute its prospects. \nTruthfully, Europe would not be the global leader that it is today if it’s not for the economic growth initiatives of countries such as the UK. \nSimilarly, investors can benefit from this revolutionary growth through time. By simply learning about the ins and outs of equity market in the UK, they, too, can succeed financially in their own ways. The Stock Exchange \nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) is the primary stock exchange in the UK. Established in 1801, it is surely one of the first stock exchanges in the world. \nWith nearly 2,300 stocks listed on it and a total market valuation of more than ‘6 trillion, the LSE is the largest stock exchange in Europe. Worldwide, it is the third largest stock exchange. \nThe LSE Group (LSEG) oversees the operation of the LSE. In October 2007, it had been established from the consolidation of the LSE and the Borsa Italiana. \nThe regular trading session on the LSE opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 4:00 p.m. The Index \nThe Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index is the benchmark blue-chip index in the UK. It tracks the 100 largest stocks on the LSE based on free-float market capitalization, representing over 80% of the total market valuation on the LSE. ISHARES II PLC ISHRS EUR GOVT BOND 3-5YR ETF EUR (DIST) is a stock traded on the U.K’s stock exchange. \nThe FTSE 100 had been established on January 3, 1984 using a base value of 1,000 points. Currently, the FTSE Group, an LSEG subsidiary, oversees the operation of the FTSE 100. As of the third quarter, it has a total market valuation of ‘1.70 trillion. \nRebalancing of the FTSE 100 happens four times a year on a Wednesday immediately succeeding the first Friday of the months of March, June, September, and December. This helps maintain the actual representation of the FTSE 100. ISHARES II PLC ISHRS EUR GOVT BOND 3-5YR ETF EUR (DIST) has relatively good liquidity. \nThe FTSE 100 is a powerful indicator of the LSE but not of the UK economy because it is mostly composed of international stocks. The FTSE 250 is a more powerful indicator of the national economy for two reasons: 1) it tracks the 250 largest stocks on the LSE, making it a broader indicator; and 2) it is mostly composed of domestic stocks. \nThe FTSE 100 had touched an all-time low of 427.50 points in February 1978 and an all-time high of 7,103.98 points in April 2015. Meanwhile, on October 11, it had touched its best intraday high of 7,129 points. \nThe UK economy has gotten better and more progressive through time. It is indeed one of the fastest growing economies in the world’ not just in Europe. \nThere is no better way to bet on this valuable economic growth than to enter the equity market in the UK. Investors can expect rewarding investment returns by trading on the LSE. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect ISHARES II PLC ISHRS EUR GOVT BOND 3-5YR ETF EUR (DIST).

      "text": "TradeDoubler AB (TRAD) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 19 \nOctober 19, 2017 - By Peter Erickson \nShares of TradeDoubler AB (STO:TRAD) closed at 3.75 yesterday. TradeDoubler AB currently has a total float of 43.92 million shares and on average sees 33,290 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 3.7 and high of 6. The Swedish Equity Market \nSweden is known around the world for a lot of global brands. However, there is so much beyond those that Sweden is rarely linked to or acknowledged for. \nWhat most people don’t know is that Sweden is also home to one of the best economies in all of Europe. With good corporate governance and a healthy trade and commerce environment, the Swedish economy is immensely growing to become more and more influential regionally and globally. It influence spread on the companies at the market like TradeDoubler AB. Through time, it has been established that Sweden is one of the most valuable contributors to the growth of the European economy. The Stock Exchange \nIn Sweden, the Stockholm Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stockholm is the main stock exchange situated in Frihamnen, Stockholm. Like the other stock exchanges in Nordic nations such as Norway and Iceland, it is owned and operated by Nasdaq, Inc. since 2008. These Nasdaq Nordic stock exchanges include the Tallinn Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Baltic; the Riga Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Baltic; the Iceland Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Iceland; the Helsinki Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Helsinki; the Copenhagen Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Copenhagen; and the Armenia Stock Exchange or Nasdaq OMX Armenia. \nThe Nasdaq Stockholm has been around since 1863. Until May 1990, it had operated at the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building using a floor trading system. It is in June 1990 that electronic trading system had arrived in the country. It brings improvements with each new year to the work of the market, helping TradeDoubler AB to stay there. \nRegular trading on the Nasdaq Stockholm opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 5:00 p.m. Today, more than 300 stocks are listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm. Its total market valuation is currently at $1.26 trillion. The Index \nThe benchmark index in Sweden is the OMX Stockholm 30 (OMXS30), which is a market-capitalization-weighted index that tracks the top 30 stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm. It uses the base value of 125 points— the base date being September 1986. \nThe OMXS30 is semi-annually rebalanced in order to ensure proper and accurate indication of the Swedish economy. Every rebalancing period, old stocks can be dropped from it and new ones can be added— largely depending on different factors and overall performance in the equity market. \nThe three largest sectors in the OMXS30 include Industrials, Financials, and Consumer Services. \nThe OMXS30 had posted its all-time low of 98.96 points, which is widely attributed to Black Monday, in November 1987. During the last few months of the year 1987, equity markets around the world had tumbled, which is an event now commonly dubbed as Black Monday. The meltdown had begun in Hong Kong and quickly spread like a wildfire worldwide. \nNonetheless, the OMXS30 had eventually banked gains, posting its all-time high of 1,719.93 in April 2015. TradeDoubler AB also received the increase. \nIt is a general truth that the best way to bet on a country’s growth potentials and long-term prospects is to penetrate its equity market.

      "text": "LYXOR ETF SOUTH AF (AFS) Decline -0.57% on Oct 19 \nOctober 19, 2017 - By Marguerite Chambers \nShares of LYXOR ETF SOUTH AF (EPA:AFS) last traded at 35.12, representing a move of -0.57%, or -0.2 per share, on volume of 1 shares. After opening the trading day at 35.12, shares of LYXOR ETF SOUTH AF traded in a close range. LYXOR ETF SOUTH AF currently has a total float of shares and on average sees 3,553 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 29.92 and high of 36.14. Euronext Paris: Driving France’s Economic Prospects \nFrance is one of Europe’s pride not just in the tourism front but most importantly, in the corporate world. One of the main reasons that Europe is immensely growing as an economy today is France. Its trading relations with LYXOR ETF SOUTH AF and other companies help both sides to grow further. The nation’s economic potentials cannot be undermined especially when they reflect in its own stable equity market. Euronext Paris in History \nEuronext Paris is part of a broader, pan-European stock exchange that stretches in five of the biggest European cities that include Paris, London, Lisbon, Brussels, and Amsterdam— the Euronext. It works with LYXOR ETF SOUTH AF as well. Some of the main Euronext indices include the AEX, AScX, CAC 40, Next 150, among others. \nThe Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Brussels Stock Exchange, and the Paris Bourse had joined together on September 22, 2000, forming the first pan-European stock exchange. Two years later, the Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto (BVLP) had joined the Euronext. The foundation of a bigger, consolidated European stock exchange signifies the efforts of the European Union (EU) to maximize its resources and leverage better growth opportunities. Nearly two decades later and the Euronext continues to live up to its founding principle and mission— to drive the European economy towards meaningful success. \nThe CAC 40 is the free-float market capitalization-weighted index tracking the top 40 stocks on Euronext Paris. It represents a crucial aspect of the French economy as well as that of the European economy. LYXOR ETF SOUTH AF had to prove its reliability to appear at the market. \nPrior to becoming a free-float market capitalization-weighted index on December 1, 2003, the CAC 40 had used to measure stocks based on overall market capitalization. Its name comes from an old automated trading system on the Euronext, CotationAssistéeenContinu. \nThe Index Steering Committee reviews the components of the CAC 40 every third Friday of March, June, September, and December. During these review dates, the Index Steering Committee limits the weights of each stock at 15%. The top 100 companies in terms of 12-month free-float market capitalization and share turnover are determined every quarter. From these 100 companies, the 40 most significant components are selected to make up the CAC 40. Euronext Paris by the Numbers \nAs of the first quarter of 2014, the Euronext already had nearly €3 trillion of market capitalization with more than 1,000 companies. \nThe CAC 40 had reached an all-time high of nearly 7,000 on September 4, 2000, a few days before the establishment of the Euronext. Meanwhile, it had posted an all-time low of below 900 in January 1988. \nThe movement on Euronext Paris is in increments of 0.50. Stocks are weighted quarterly using a base value of 1,000, which was determined on December 31, 1987. \nThe margin requirement is usually 2% while the minimum trade size requirement is one index. As part of the EU, the main trading currency on Euronext Paris is euro. \nEuronext Paris is one of the most influential stock exchanges not just in Europe but in the world as well. It boasts with stability and strong, long-term growth prospects. That being said, investing in Euronext Paris is a primary consideration among novice and experienced investors alike.
