# Contributing

## General Workflow

  To start...
    1. Fork this repo, then clone your fork. 
    2. Add a remote upstream to the original repo (not your forked repo). 
    3. Run "npm install" from the CLI. 

  Ongoing...
    1. When you start working, or after receiving a notice of recently merged code, run "git pull --rebase upstream master" to get the latest code.
    2. Commit changes regularly with clear commit messages...(added 'feature', fixed 'issue' refactored 'file', etc.).
    3. To add your code to the main repo, first push up your code to your forked master. 
    4. Make a pull request to the main repo and notify.
    5. Once the code reviewer approves your code and resolves any conflicts, it will be merged into the code base.
