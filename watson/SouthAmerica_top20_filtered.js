      "text": "October 24, 2017 Press Release No comments \nPublic relations on social media marketing have become increasingly popular. They help reach a wider audience, build credibility among the online community, and improve relationships with customers. \nOne might think that it’s easy to pay someone to recommend your brand and wait for amazing metrics. However, deep analysis is needed to find the right person that will definitely increase your content’s reach and keep your followers engaged. \nHow to identify the perfect match \nThe perfect match occurs when the influencer’s audience happens to be very similar to the brand’s target. Moreover, this person is highly acclaimed among the company’s followers because they share similar interests and values. \nOnly those social media strategists who truly know their audience are able to identify the influencer who will share the brand’s content with the right kind of people, who will ultimately join the company’s ideal online community. \nPR on social media marketing helps develop more honest relationships with customers. It is essential to have a team with good connections to be able to make contact with the ideal influencer. \nThe risks \nNevertheless, strategists should know that they won’t be able to control the content produced by this person but that’s what makes it honest and appealing to the audience. \nIt is essential to constantly monitor the impact caused by the influencer in order to find out whether it was a good choice. One of the benefits social media platforms offer is associated with the possibility to make changes anytime if needed. \nIf the chosen influencer does little to help the company in terms of its business purpose, strategists can quickly stop relying on this person. However, any changes must be made carefully, always considering that bad decisions can trigger long-lasting conversations on social media with high damage potential. \nBenefits Of Social Media Marketing \nSocial media is a recent enough thing. It has shot to the limelight and to its credit, it does seem to have many benefits apart from finding long-lost friends! To a business or an entrepreneur, social media has come down like a boon.

The company's official said the plan will be carried out next year. \n\"Our business plan for 2018 is to become an e-money issuer,\" The bank's distribution and services director Edwin Dwidjajanto said on Monday, October 2017. \nRead: Muamalat Named Best Islamic Bank in Indonesia 2017 \n\nIf the plan materializes, Edwin said, BSM will become Indonesia's first Islamic bank that issues its own e-money separately, not through co-branding with its holding. \nEdwin said the bank also supports the government's program to fully implement a non-cash system in toll roads. BSM plans to distribute and promote their e-money cards by exempting users from paying for the card-making fee. \nThis year, BSM plans to produce an additional of 25,000 e-money cards. \n\"The sharia e-money market is still very small because Islamic bank customers only account for a little over five percent [of the total banking market],\" he said. \nBISNIS",

Germany | 24/10/2017 Astra Games, part of NOVOMATIC UK, has signed a new distribution agreement with German-based casino equipment distributor E-Systems GmbH for the provision of Ainsworth Gaming Technology products in several European markets. \nThe deal reaffirms the long-standing partnership between E-Systems and Ainsworth UK following the restructuring of the Ainsworth business in Europe. \nUnder the newly extended agreement, E-Systems, formerly known as D-Systems, will continue to provide Ainsworth products into Germany, Austria, Poland and Luxemburg, as well as to several European customers. The Ainsworth product suite includes a range of slot machines such as the A640, A600 and A600 ST, as well as a wide selection of games and jackpot solutions. \n“We are pleased to sign this new agreement for E-Systems to continue delivering Ainsworth products into key markets in Europe. This partnership has been successful over the past years and we look forward to gaining more market share as the Ainsworth product portfolio develops for the European markets,” Phil Burke, Director of UK Casino & Export for Astra Games and Ainsworth UK, said. \n“I’m excited to continue the distribution of Ainsworth gaming machines. We’ve been a distributor of the Ainsworth brand for 12 years, we rolled out the first Ainsworth slots in the German-speaking market and we were able to grow the market share constantly each year. We are convinced that the new generation of Ainsworth gaming machines will be a great addition to all our customers’ product portfolios and that we can build on the success of the past,” Emilia Tomachinska, General Manager E-Systems, added.

Germany | 24/10/2017 Astra Games, part of NOVOMATIC UK, has signed a new distribution agreement with German-based casino equipment distributor E-Systems GmbH for the provision of Ainsworth Gaming Technology products in several European markets. \nThe deal reaffirms the long-standing partnership between E-Systems and Ainsworth UK following the restructuring of the Ainsworth business in Europe. \nUnder the newly extended agreement, E-Systems, formerly known as D-Systems, will continue to provide Ainsworth products into Germany, Austria, Poland and Luxemburg, as well as to several European customers. The Ainsworth product suite includes a range of slot machines such as the A640, A600 and A600 ST, as well as a wide selection of games and jackpot solutions. \n“We are pleased to sign this new agreement for E-Systems to continue delivering Ainsworth products into key markets in Europe. This partnership has been successful over the past years and we look forward to gaining more market share as the Ainsworth product portfolio develops for the European markets,” Phil Burke, Director of UK Casino & Export for Astra Games and Ainsworth UK, said. \n“I’m excited to continue the distribution of Ainsworth gaming machines. We’ve been a distributor of the Ainsworth brand for 12 years, we rolled out the first Ainsworth slots in the German-speaking market and we were able to grow the market share constantly each year. We are convinced that the new generation of Ainsworth gaming machines will be a great addition to all our customers’ product portfolios and that we can build on the success of the past,” Emilia Tomachinska, General Manager E-Systems, added.

The groups have been excoriated as a sectarian tool of Iran due to the heavy representation of Shia Muslim organizations. Shi'ites form a plurality among Iraqis. \n“No party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,” Abadi's media office said in a statement prior to Tillerson's visit. \nShia militia include those who ideologically align with the Islamic Republic of Iran such as the Badr Organization, who worked with U.S. troops following the 2003 U.S. invasion, as well as groups like Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq – a paramilitary group that carried out daring operations against occupying forces during the insurrection that followed the collapse of the Iraqi state. \nAfghan, Iranian and Lebanese fighters have fought alongside local militia in a regional effort against the transnational extremist that was coordinated with Iran's aid. \nAsa'ib Ahl al-Haq reacted to Tillerson's comment by saying it would be Americans who will be forced to leave Iraq. \n\"Your forces should get ready to get out of our country once the excuse of Daesh's presence is over,\" said Asaib's leader, Qais al-Khazali, according to the group's TV channel, al-Aahd. \nRELATED: 67% of US Citizens Don’t Want to Pull Out of Iran Deal: Poll \nWashington has 5,000 troops in Iraq and provided air support, training and weapons to Iraqi government forces. At the same time, Iran armed, trained and advised the Popular Mobilization Units that often fought alongside the army. \nFollowing Tillerson's comments, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that the U.S. top diplomat's message was dictated by Iran’s oil-rich arch-rival Saudi Arabia. \n“Exactly what country is it that Iraqis who rose up to defend their homes against ISIS return to?,” Zarif said in a tweet. “Shameful US FP (foreign policy), dictated by petrodollars.” \nSpeaking from the South African capital Pretoria later in the day, Zarif noted that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is “isolated in the world.” \n“Unfortunately, the Americans do not want to rectify their viewpoint that Iran is a source of stability and peace as well as a campaigner against terrorism in the region,” he said, according to state-run Iranian news network Press TV. \nAt his meeting with Abadi in Baghdad, Tillerson urged the Iraqi government and Masoud Barzani's Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil to resolve their conflict on Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue. \n\"We are concerned and a bit sad,\" Tillerson said. \"We have friends in Baghdad and friends in Erbil, and we encourage all parties to enter into the discussion ... and all differences can be addressed.\" Tags",

The seventh issue, that of the productive economy of the countryside … and the eighth issue, the strengthening of the CLAP, and I add to this the Christmas CLAP Plan, which will make the CLAP Plan with happiness”, he reported. \nPresident Maduro announced that in the next few hours a meeting will be held with the High Political Command, with the objective of evaluating strategic issues of national interest. \nHe said that thanks to the National Constituent Assembly has consolidated the stability and peace of the country. \n“The first stage of the revolution was opened from the constituent path … Which were the objectives?, to definitively remove the old oligarchy: Achieved. To regain the political independence of the country: Achieved. To endow the country with a new constitution and a new institutionality, Achieved. To start the process of building a new society more solidarity, advanced … A constituent path that allowed us in democracy to make a revolution that has been an example for the whole world”, he said. \nHe assured that the constituent power is the protective mantle of the institutional life and the Venezuelan society: “It is the super-power for any circumstance, any matter”, he emphasized. \nHe emphasized on the great victory of the Bolivarian Revolution in the regional elections of last October 15, where the patriot forces were adjudicated 18 Governors against 5 Governorates by the right wing.

Purchasing various domains might seem pricey, but buying and renewing domains come on an annual basis, hosting these domain names will cost a lot of money. But, find a web host which allows subscribers host more than one domain name or Multi-Domain Hosting, will help save you plenty that could have paid for getting the domain names in any respect. Although, the choice of Linux or vps hosting providers depends on your budget and requirements. \nFor instance: say you have an existing site with a website hosting company, and you’ve got an idea for a website startup, registering a domain name for this service. When you have the domain name, you commence on constructing your site without needing to worry about paying anything again until the domain name is due back. However, if the time comes around for analyzing the website on a live host, how can you test it without needing to purchase a different hosting package? \nIf your current site has Infinite Domain Names, then you may add your next domain to the accounts. All it requires is the FTP account that’s included from the web host provider. Many suppliers demand a sub-folder that’s made inside the main folder of your present site. \nIf a server as cPanel, you then can have your domain set up within seconds by directing the domain DNS settings toward the web host’s DNS address back into the folder to your second domain. After your new domain name is ready to go, just imagine how a lot more domains you’ll have on one single hosting account. The very best aspect of all Multi-Domain hosting providers is that a whole lot of them provide Unlimited Disk Space and Bandwidth. \nHosting multiple domains might also be an excellent source of minimum income by supplying customers hosting for a commission. This isn’t suggested to get a Share Hosting accounts since there are a few limitations involving you and your clients in the event of an issue unless you’re hosting sites between close coworkers for smaller jobs. Obtaining a Reseller accounts is your ideal way to host domain names for different people with custom limitations on Disk Space and Bandwidth usage. \nAdditionally, some hosts need a setup fee, even though a lot of them don’t. Using Multi Domain Hosting in the present or alternative web host solutions, you can get your next product or company and a lot more under one single account. It not only saves you money from having to have another account for every website. \nFor any information about linux web hosting company selection ask for free consultation only at Onesnaphost.com. \nAuthor’s Bio: \nSam is a web developer and freelance consultant for SMEs.

The art style and animation must match our existing work and we have multiple references if required. \nPlease note: We only work directly with the artist, not a third party or a company.

Our character has 8 directions of movement but the player is expected to be able to perform the action in front/back/mirrored left and right poses. \nThis job is to animate the attached chibi digging a hole in all three positions. \nAnimation frame is 512x512 pixels and the artist is free to use whatever tool they like. \nThe artist must provide: \n* stand alone animation frames for all 3 poses in png format \nWe do not need the hole itself but the artist can decide if they want to animate dirt or rocks as part of the animation. \nReference art for front/back/side will be provided. The art style and animation must match our existing work and we have multiple references if required. \nPlease note: We only work directly with the artist, not a third party or a company. Your overheads are unnecessary. If you are not the artist bidding, we will remove your bid immediately.",

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Automotive   \nAs per the report “ Turbocharger Market By Technology (Wastegate technology, Variable geometry technology), By Fuel Type (Gasoline, Diesel), By End-User (OEM, After Market), Industry trends, Estimation & forecast, 2016 – 2024,” The global turbocharger market was valued at $10.2 billion in 2016, and is projected to reach $24.07 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 11.6% from 2017 to 2024. In 2016, the diesel turbocharger segment held the highest revenue share of nearly 57% of the global turbocharger market share. Among major regions, Europe was the highest revenue generating market in 2016. \n“The current obsession with improving fuel economy and the enforced reduction in emissions is proving a boon for manufacturers of turbochargers. Moreover, new government fuel economy regulations and the prospect of higher fuel prices are driving the stampede to turbocharge. However, the upcoming trend of electric vehicles due to environmental concerns can act as a major impeding factor to the turbocharger market growth” Request Sample Report @ https://www.esticastresearch.com/market-reports/turbocharger-market/request-sample Twin turbo technology emerged out as the most adopted technology for turbochargers \nThe twin-turbo also called as bi-turbo refers to a turbocharged engine in which two turbochargers compress the intake charge and use it for the combustion. As a result of less piping requirement and reduced turbo lag, the twin turbo market held approx. 44% of the overall turbocharger market in 2016 and is witnessed to dominate the market throughout the forecast period of 2017-2024, having a CAGR of 10.8%. However, the variable geometry turbochargers are expected to experience the fastest growth having a CAGR of 12.3% during the entire forecast period. This is a result of certain emerging advantages of variable geometry turbochargers. According to a research done by International Journal of Trend in Research and Development (IJTRD), variable geometry turbochargers (VGT) can increase the charged air mass by 10-20%, increase the torque by 40% and considerably reduce the exhaust smoke due to complete fuel combustion. With innovations in technology, Diesel turbochargers would receive a higher adoption, especially in Europe. \nDiesel turbochargers are ruling the overall turbocharger market owing to low cost of diesel and higher fuel efficiency. Diesel is up to 30 percent more fuel efficient than gasoline, and it already dominates many markets in Europe, where fuel is more expensive. Exponential rise in demand of cost-effective and fuel-efficient engines has led to a higher adoption of turbocharger across industries such as automotive, marine, and aerospace & defense. The diesel turbocharger market is expected to witness a CAGR of 11.8% during the forecast period. \nGLOBAL TURBOCHARGER MARKET BY APPLICATION \n\nLight commercial Vehicle turbochargers will dominate the entire market throughout the forecast period holding nearly 1/4th of the total market share in 2016. This is a result of hiked LCV production all over the globe, especially in Europe and Asia Pacific. Europe to lead the global turbocharger market as a result of being the largest automobile manufacturing market \nEurope held nearly 43% of the global turbocharger market in 2016 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7% during the forecast period as a result of high automobile production in countries such as, Germany and stringent emission rules imposed by a European government. However, Asia Pacific turbocharger market is expected to witness the fastest growth rate of 12.3% owing to constantly increasing vehicle production, large population base, growing demand for diesel vehicles and upcoming emission norms.

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Press Release No comments \nAs per the report “ Refrigerated Display Cases Market by Type (Plug-in RDC, Remote RDC), by Product Design (Vertical, Horizontal, Hybrid & semi-hybrid), Industry trends, Estimation & Forecast, 2016 – 2024,” the global refrigerated display cases market was valued at $12.10 billion in 2016, and is projected to reach $25.4 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 9.8 % from 2017 to 2024. In 2016, the Plug-in RDC segment generated the highest revenue share in the global refrigerated display cases market. Among major regions, Europe market was the highest revenue generating market in 2016. \n“Factors such as the expansion of retail industry including supermarkets and hypermarkets, rapidly changing food preferences of people, developing lifestyles and increasing disposable incomes are propelling the demand of RDCs globally. In addition to this, an overabundance of new developments in small-scale food and retail sector combined with the inclination towards food safety concerns, are expected to boost the demand for RDCs in the near future.” \nRequest Sample Report @ https://www.esticastresearch.com/market-reports/refrigerated-display-cases-market/request-sample Plug-in RDC was the highest adopted product type in 2016, owing to their high energy efficiency \nPlug-in RDCs dominated the market by holding nearly 70% of the overall market share in 2016 and are expected to maintain their dominance throughout the forecast period of 2017-2024. Plug-in RDCs are more space and energy efficient, compared to remote RDCs. In addition to this, the initial capital investment required for the installation of these products is considerably lower than remote RDCs. A rapid demand of in-plug RDCs from small and medium-sized stores, which often have limited investment power and floor space, is supposed to push the market growth of these products. According to U.S. Department of Energy, refrigerated cases with transparent display doors can reduce heat loads on the refrigeration system by 50-80%, resulting in notable electricity savings by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes into the store. Vertical RDCs are expected to witness higher demand as against horizontal or hybrid RDCs \nOn the basis of design, the vertical RDC segment held nearly 3/5th of the overall RDC market share. The market is expected to witness the fastest growth rate having a CAGR of 10.2% throughout the forecast period. Features such as more display space per unit area of floor make vertical RDCs favored by store operators. On the other hand, horizontal RDCs are also expected to exhibit a notable growth trend during the forecast period, as a result of their rising demand in organized large size retail food stores. Hybrid and semi-hybrid RDCs, have a dual temperature control system. This is getting gradually adopted by the store owners, especially due to increasing demand from cafes and quick service restaurants. An upsurge in the growth of retail stores and supermarkets will lead Asia-Pacific to grow at a substantial rate. \nThe Asia-Pacific RDC market is expected to witness the fastest growth having a CAGR of 11.7% during the forecast period of 2017-2024. A stimulated economic growth and increasing population in the emerging economies such as India and China will create opportunities for the retail and grocery market to grow in the very region.

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Press Release No comments \nSQL is one of the most challenging and time consuming languages to both learn and write and this makes it all the more difficult to deal with when it is attacked. SQL injection is an attack where a malicious SQL code is executed within code already written to enable the attacker to take control of a web application’s database server. \nThe difficult thing about reducing the chance of an attack is that SQL injection defense isn’t taught in most SQL based courses and so people are often unaware or struggle to know how to defend against such attacks. While SQL injection attacks seem to be as powerful as ever, there are some great defenses that you can put into place that will help in SQL injection attack protection . \nThe biggest thing you remember when you’re putting in place SQL injection defense is that it has to be integrated very deeply. If you don’t cover all the bases then attackers will very easily be able to work their way around the defense mechanisms you have put into place and will essentially render your efforts completely worthless. Once you get into the flow of protecting your SQL code you will be able to integrate it much more easily as and when you are writing the code itself. \nA really simple way of protecting yourself from SQL injection is to limit permissions. This might make things more complicated if there are things that you desperately need permissions for but if you apply this wherever possible then even if an attacker using a SQL injection attack then they won’t get the outcome that they are after. As much as possible limiting accounts to read only or with limited permissions unless it is absolutely necessary will reduce the amount of data attackers are able to get out of it. \nWhen you want to protect your code from SQL injection attacks there are plenty of things you implement into the code itself that will protect you. If you’re wondering how effective your SQL defense coding is then you can use a SQL injection defense test. This will highlight areas that you need to improve on and will help you in the long run when writing code in the future. Share this:",

I want to have a loading time of at least 10 seconds where a specific loading icon should show, where I want to be able to insert different slogans that presents itself for the user. In the documentation for the public api then it´s written that the public version is limited to at most 4 requests of any nature in a given 1 minute time frame. So it means when this limit is exceeded then the request need to added in a queue, where the user should se the loading icon with the text \"You are number # in the queue, please wait.\"",

      "text": "For Women’s Health has started an 80% off promotion on amazon for their belly fat removal tool: the suction cup. \nThe promotion has limited quantities, and women who want to lose belly fat fast and at the same time save a lot of money, must use this link http://www.forwomenhealth.org/80-off and this coupon code VR4JCCLY on the checkout page to get their suction cup set for only $9.99, discounted from $44.99. \nBefore they have started to sell suction cups on amazon, For Women’s Health general manager, Samantha has tested the cups on 80 American women who wanted to lose belly fat fast. \nThey were all overweight and have started using suction cups on their stomach area twice per day, for 2 weeks. \nAfter the 2 weeks of the test, 43 women have lost over 2 inches from their waist and 27 of them have lost over 1 inch from their waistline. \nFive of them have lost half of an inch from their waistline, while the remaining 5 women didn’t see any results because they didn’t use the cups daily. \nBelow are the steps women must follow for removing belly with suction cups. \nFirst, they need to apply coconut oil to the area where they will be using the suction cup. It can also be used in the shower. \nThen, they must get the air out of the suction cup by pinching it with their fingers. \nWhile retaining the pressure on the suction cup, women must place it on the stomach area. \nOnce the suction cup has been placed in contact with the skin, they can release the pressure with their fingers. The skin from belly is now sucked in to the suction cup and the removal of fatty deposits can begin. \nThey must massage the stomach area making circular movements for 1 minute. \nThe suction cup must be moved from the bottom to the top of the area they are stimulating. Once it reaches the top, the suction cup can be unstuck and the movement can be repeated for 3 minutes. \nOnce they have finished treating the stomach area, they can get air back into the suction cup in order to unstick it from the skin and then they can start cupping on the thigh area for similar results. \nWomen who want to lose 2 inches from their waistline in just 2 weeks, have to use this link http://www.forwomenhealth.org/80-off and this coupon code VR4JCCLY on the checkout page to get their suction cup set for only $9.99 on amazon, discounted from $44.99. \nAbout us: For Women’s Health is an Amazon seller, one of the best in the beauty department, with thousands of happy female clients. \nContact: Company: For Women’s Health Address: 128 Main Street, 03262, N.

Our character has 8 directions of movement but the player is expected to be able to perform the action in front/back/mirrored left and right poses. \nThis job is to animate the attached chibi digging a hole in all three positions. \nAnimation frame is 512x512 pixels and the artist is free to use whatever tool they like. \nThe artist must provide: \n* stand alone animation frames for all 3 poses in png format \nWe do not need the hole itself but the artist can decide if they want to animate dirt or rocks as part of the animation. \nReference art for front/back/side will be provided. The art style and animation must match our existing work and we have multiple references if required. \nPlease note: We only work directly with the artist, not a third party or a company. Your overheads are unnecessary. If you are not the artist bidding, we will remove your bid immediately.",
