Despite losing a few positions at the start, he was able to bounce back with brilliant driving skills.\"Sainz Jr.'s Renault team-mate, Nico H√ºlkenberg, failed to finish due to a drop in oil pressure.",

      "text": "Sex and the City actress Kim Cattrall has said she has \"never been friends\" with the show's other stars.\nThe 61-year-old, who played Samantha Jones, told Piers Morgan on ITV there was a \"toxic relationship\".\nThe actress ruled out appearing in a third Sex and the City movie, and denied that her decision was down to pay or \"diva\" demands.\nCattrall commented that former co-star Sarah Jessica Parker \"could have been nicer\" about the situation.\nAfter years of rumours of a feud, Cattrall told Piers Morgan's Life Stories she couldn't recall the last time she spoke to the show's other main stars.\nThe actress said: \"We've never been friends. We've been colleagues and in some ways it's a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal.\"\nShe told Morgan her decision not to do another film wasn't down to demands for more money or more screen time, but was simply \"an empowered decision in my life to end one chapter and start another\".\nShe took issue with being portrayed in the press as \"demanding or a diva\".\nShe said: \"This is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City and specifically Sarah Jessica Parker, is that I think she could have been nicer. I really think she could have been nicer. I don't know what her issue is.\n\"The thing that still bothers me is this feeling of being in some way made to be the baddie. I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects, to be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.\"\nA different actress could play Samantha Jones in the future, she suggested.\n\"I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it,\" she said. \"Maybe they could make it an African-American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones, or bring in another character.\"\nShe added that she wished her former co-stars the best. \"I will be the one in the audience cheering them on,\" she said.\nIn the interview, Cattrall also revealed that her career had \"hugely\" affected her relationships.\nThe Liverpool-born actress, who has been married three times, admitted to putting work before her relationships, conceding she never made them a priority.\nCattrall also told how she had considered IVF in her early 40s, but realised that her filming schedule on the Sex and the City TV series ruled it out.\nThe star described working 19-hour days on the show, and realising that she wouldn't have time to commit to having IVF treatment, let alone a baby. She called the moment she realised she wouldn't have children \"extraordinary\".\nKim Cattrall appears on Piers Morgan's Life Stories on ITV on Monday 23 October at 21:00 BST.\nPhoto copyright: GETTY IMAGES (Caption: Kim Cattrall (second right) vowed she would never play Samantha Jones again)\nSource: BBC",

      "text": "Be Prepared With A Winter Check From Vauxhall By Kyle Lindsay Comments (0) Vauxhall is helping its customers beat the winter blues when they book in their vehicle for a comprehensive 25-point health check. \nThe seasonal Check and Treat programme looks after vehicle and driver alike, with customers able to choose between coffee and cake, cinema tickets or headphones for themselves as an added bonus. \nThe difficult driving conditions associated with winter, such as poor visibility, colder weather and more variable road conditions mean that drivers need to be confident that their car will keep them and their occupants safe and sound. For just ¬£25, drivers can treat their car to a 25-point check, carried out by Vauxhall-trained technicians. This will include checking steering and suspension among other key components, as well as topping-up vital fluids to ensure vehicles are ready for whatever winter brings. \nOnce the car has been thoroughly checked, customers can then treat themselves, with vouchers for coffee and cake, cinema tickets or a set of headphones up for grabs to make the start of winter a bit more bearable. \n‚ÄúWinter can bring with it some pretty nasty driving conditions; rain, wind, slippery road surfaces and longer, darker nights, so it‚Äôs important to make sure that your car is winter-ready,‚Äù said Alex Shields, Vauxhall‚Äôs Head of Ownership Programmes and Personalisation. ‚ÄúOur technicians will take a thorough look at each car that comes in for a 25-point check, so drivers can rest assured that their car is in top condition for the difficult months ahead.‚Äù \nCustomers can visit the Vauxhall website for more information, and to book a Vauxhall Check and Treat at a local participating retailer.

      "text": "Staff Union Welcomes Next EPO President, Hopes For Dialogue 23/10/2017 by Intellectual Property Watch Leave a Comment   is a   service and depends   \nIn a letter to its members, the Staff Union of the European Patent Office (SUEPO) in The Hague, Netherlands has welcomed the election of Antonio Campinos as new President of the EPO a week ago, expressed hope for a change in EPO management-workforce relations and has some recommendations for next steps. \nThe union has gone all the way to the European Court of Human Rights with a complaint against what it claims are ‚Äúviolations of fundamental rights and an apparent systematic disregard for the rule of law‚Äù and ‚Äúmanagement by fear, isolation and punishment‚Äù by the outgoing EPO President Benoit Battistelli. \nIn the 18 October letter [pdf] to its colleagues obtained by Intellectual Property Watch , it calls for a renewed dialogue over working conditions and staff welfare. The Administrative Council, according to the Suepo letter, paved the way with ‚Äúunprecedented requirements‚Äù put in the vacancy notice for the top position. The notice included a request for ‚Äúan outstanding ability to engage in social dialogue.‚Äù For Suepo, this is an indication of the Council‚Äôs desire ‚Äúto re-establish harmonious working conditions‚Äù and ‚Äúto dissipate the atmosphere generated over the past few years.‚Äù \nLooking ahead, the union recommended a multilateral working group between management and staff to address a number of issues. The working group should set out on a truth-finding mission and consider, according to SUEPO‚Äôs call, ‚Äúconcrete action where necessary‚Äù on violations of law and staff welfare. \nIt should also consider reversing rather politically motivated sanctions of all staff representatives and union leaders and identify problems with reforms initiated by Battistelli to push efficiency, it said. Suepo, the letter states, is prepared to fully support such efforts. \nAt a recent event with the newly elected chair of the EPO Administrative Council, a considerable number of patent lawyers expressed their support for changes at the EPO which due to the pressure on its staff was producing substandard search reports ( IPW , Europe, 16 October 2017 ). \nCampinos is not due to take office until July 2018.",

The more I play this game the more the fact that Rare are the masters of putting googly eyes on inanimate objects is reinforced. Gobi‚Äôs Valley starts with a thirsty palm tree, and his little eyes just make me want to help him out. The rest of the map is good, and it‚Äôs the first one where I found myself close to death thanks to the quicksand and unforgiving insta-death maze. \n\n\nI also went back to complete Freezeazy peak ‚Äì beating the bear in a footrace after unlocking the trainers in Gobi‚Äôs Valley (interestingly, the only instance in the game where a level can‚Äôt be fully completed after entering it), and this was surprisingly hard! I was very satisfied when I beat it. \n\nBattletoads: I took the plunge and fired up Battletoads. Rare Replay edition gives you two crucial tools here: The rewind function and auto-save, effectively meaning you will never have to complete the same section twice. \n\nEven with these trvilialisation tools, it took me hours to get through each stage. And I‚Äôm now stuck at a stage where you have to race a rat to the bottom of the level, which makes the insta-rewind useless. He moves so quickly, and you have to beat him three times. I‚Äôm stuck on the third time and it feels impossible. \n\nI cannot fathom how people beat this game back in the day. I‚Äôve only ever played the SNES version, Battletoads in Battlemaniacs, which is a sort-of-HD-remake of the original ‚Äì and I‚Äôd given up on the Turbo Tunnel level in that game, so I was completely unaware of the trials and tribulations that awaited me after said Turbo Tunnel. I‚Äôd thought that the Tunnel was just a weird difficulty spike, and that the rest of the game would be more forgiving. What I‚Äôve found is that the Turbo Tunnel was but an hors d‚Äôoeurve to what was to come. Later levels make the Tunnel look like a stroll in the park. \n\n\nThe surfing level is essentially the same as the tunnel, but with the difficulty doubled. There‚Äôs a level in which you‚Äôre chased by a series of giant cogs, with one misstep resulting in instant death. This level also involves blind drops onto spikes ‚Äì a feature designed in such a way which means there is simply no way in Hell that you‚Äô be able to complete this level on your first try. Without the rewind, Id definitely still be stuck on this level. The same goes for the bizarre snake-riding level, which is as odd as it is difficult. \n\nI‚Äôm impressed with how diverse and polished the game is, but to a much greater degree I‚Äôm baffled by the difficulty. The legends are true about this game. It‚Äôs staggeringly tough. \n\nGrabbed by the Ghoulies: I decided to fire this one up having never played Rare‚Äôs first game after being bought by Microsoft. From what I read about this game at the time, it marked a significant drop in quality from the stellar run Rare had been on in the N64 days, so I was curious to see if this was true. \n\nAfter 2 hours into the game I can certainly see why this criticism was levelled at it. It lacks much of the charm and polish of Rare‚Äôs older games, and the mechanics are rather simple ‚Äì bash enemies using your fists or objects in the mansion until you unlock the next room. \n\nThe graphics are nice though, and the destructibility of the environments would definitely have been impressive in its day. It opts for the odd control scheme of twin-stick shooters: move with one, attack with the direction of the other. It works fine, but I think it would‚Äôve been more satisfying to attack with a button. \n\nThe milestones on this one are quite demanding, so I‚Äôll be very acquainted with this one before I‚Äôm done. \nSnapshot Progress \n\nBattletoads: My escapades in the main game have helped me to beat all 5 of these, happy days! I think that‚Äôs probably a good mantra going forward for the other games: acquaint myself with the main game proper before snapshotting. \n\nDigger T Rock: Told myself that I must beat that first falling rock. Managed it and got three stamps ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually not as horrendous as I first thought, and much more playable than Gunfright or Knight‚Äôs Lore. \n\nSolar Jetman: I went back and discovered that pressing X whilst boosting gives you an extra thrust of sorts, which made a couple of the stamps easy. I‚Äôm stuck on one which has you transport a diamond back to your ship without getting hit. It‚Äôs very hard. \n\nSnake Rattle ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll: Another one I went back to after a horrendous first impression. I think I‚Äôm acclimatising to the old-school nature of the games of this era, as I found it ok. Got a couple of stamps, and am now stuck on the fourth, which is a mushroom-stomping one. I take back my scathing words. \n\nGunfright: I managed one more stamp which involved following pointing townsfolk and shooting some guy. In this game you die if you touch anyone or any thing, and it‚Äôs very frustrating running into a woman villager and dying. This feature plus the slow movement make it a pain to play. \n\nSlalom: Managed one more stamp, the next one involves keeping your average speed over 100mph and I‚Äôm finding it difficult. Somehow I haven‚Äôt figured out if going through the gates gives you a speed boost or not. \n\nBattletoads Arcade: I completed Battletoads Arcade‚Äôs snapshots! It‚Äôs much prettier than the NES version, but much, much easier. I‚Äôll probably delve into the main game next. \n\nOverall a successful third day with a lot of progress made. I‚Äôm encouraged by my acceptance of the older games that I initially found unplayable, maybe I‚Äôm changing‚Ä¶ Stampers Forever progress: 21%",

It would be true to say that some people take the quiz more seriously than others, (look for the furrowed brows), but at the end of the day, it is a fun event, and there is always a good atmosphere. \nEveryone is welcome. And if you fancy setting a quiz one week, let the organisers know, as they are always looking for guest quiz-masters. \nP.S. The owner of Blue Turtle, Barƒ±≈ü is returning to his home town of Izmir and a new owner is taking over. There is a farewell/handover party organised for Saturday 28th October, starting at 19.30. Good luck to both Barƒ±≈ü and to the new owners.",

      "text": "Curry fined $50,000 for throwing mouthpiece at official By Omnisport 23 Oct 2017, 23:31 - \nStephen Curry was fined $50,000 for throwing his mouthpiece in the direction of a game official during the final minute of Saturday's loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, the NBA announced. \nThe Golden State Warriors guard tossed his mouthpiece toward an official when no foul was called as he drove to the hoop for a layup. \nHe was immediately ejected but said after the game he was not trying to intentionally throw it at the official. \n\"I got better aim than that. I threw it out of frustration,\" he said. \nAs part of the same incident, Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was fined $15,000 for verbally abusing a game official. \nThe Warriors were called for three technical fouls on the night while there were a combined 54 fouls between the two teams. The Warriors were called for 28 of those fouls and 26 were called on the Grizzlies. \nCurry finished the night with 37 points on nine-of-17 shooting.

This spooky scene depicts a classic Halloween night ‚Äì but has one unwelcome visitor‚Ä¶ Lurking among the ghoulish ghosts, the crazy clowns and the scary skeletons is ONE burglar ‚Äì playing the biggest trick of all. The timely teaser ‚Äì created by security specialist Yale in conjunction with National Home Security Month ‚Äì invites you to find the burglar, wearing a trademark black and white striped top as he makes off with his bag of loot on the scariest night of the year. But with warnings of a 160 per cent increase in domestic burglary over the Halloween and Bonfire Night period, homeowners are being advised to protect their homes. National Home Security Month, which runs throughout October, is raising awareness of the importance of home security and giving advice on safeguarding properties. Nigel Fisher, MD for Yale headline sponsor of NHSM, said: ‚ÄúUnbeknown to many, the last week of October and the first week of November is actually the worst time of year for burglaries. ‚ÄúAs people go out and about trick or treating, or attending bonfires, their homes are being left unattended in the dark. ‚ÄúCommunities are therefore extremely vulnerable to unwanted guests, and should take additional steps to ensure all belongings are safe and secure.‚Äù For the latest home security solutions, visit www.yalestore.co.uk .

      "text": "AAB‚Äôs outsourcing division grows 25% in 2017   Anderson Anderson & Brown LLP (AAB), one of the leading independent firms of Chartered Accountants and Business Advisors in Scotland, has announced that fee income within its outsourcing division has grown by 25% in the last 12 months, driven by 50 new clients coming on board throughout the UK. This new business gained has resulted in 5 new posts being created in this division alone, as well as giving rise to 5 promotions within the team. Whilst over half of AAB‚Äôs outsourcing clients are still UK headquartered an increasing number of international businesses coming to the UK are now working in partnership with AAB, with many of these businesses being internationally owned or managed from overseas, in a host of countries including Norway, Italy, USA, UAE, Italy, Mexico, Australia and Russia. Through AAB‚Äôs cloud based outsourcing solutions, businesses can be transformed by a service which takes care of all accounting, bookkeeping, UK and international tax, VAT, global payroll, project management and data capture requirements. The growth achieved in this area has been as a result of both client and market demand for cloud-based services which offer businesses the opportunity to gain real-time information on their key business areas, from anywhere in the world, at any time. Steve Mitchell, Partner and Head of Outsourcing at AAB commented ‚ÄúTechnology truly has made the world a smaller place and because of cloud-based software systems, users can access real-time data from any location, globally, at any time, as long as they have access to the internet, meaning that they constantly have an up-to-date view of their business finances available at their fingertips. We are delighted with the significant growth in our outsourcing business in the last year and are now working with a fantastic range of clients across a broad range of sectors and geographical locations. We are very much focussed on working in partnership with our clients to deliver them the best outsourcing solution to add value to their business .‚Äù",

PUBLISHED: 22:07, Mon, Oct 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:22, Mon, Oct 23, 2017 \nBuried in a report on ‚Äúminimum income schemes‚Äù by the European Union Parliament‚Äôs Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, MEPs advocated providing an income ‚Äúthat is above the poverty line‚Äù and added the moves should be accompanied by ‚Äúthe provision of public services such as health, education and childcare‚Äù. \nAlthough the report has not been ratified by the EU Parliament and it has not legislative power as any directive by the body can be voted down by individual states, it can be seen as a further move by the bloc to increasingly interfere in people‚Äôs lives. \nAreas such as healthcare provision and childcare issues have not been of concern for the EU and previously seen as the domain of individual countries to decide. \nA vote for the measures by the EU Parliament could open the door for the Brussels apparatchiks to start dictating over a country‚Äôs domestic policies and start imposing their rules and regulations into the minute details of people‚Äôs lives. Getty/EPA The EU wants to gain control of areas such as health and childcare \nBuried further in the report, MEPs discuss people‚Äôs minimum income ‚Äúto meet people‚Äôs fundamental needs, including also non-monetary aspects, such as access to education and lifelong learning, decent housing, quality healthcare services, social activities and civic participation‚Äù. \nIn the report, written by Italian left-winger Laura Agea, the explanatory statement says: ‚ÄúThe minimum income scheme should be coupled with a strategic approach aiming at social integration; to that end, it is recommended that effective social protection measures regarding parts of people‚Äôs lives such as the guarantee of housing, health care, education and training, should be adopted in parallel with the implementation of the minimum income scheme.‚Äù \nThe report comes at a time when there are strong factions with the member states seemingly pulling in different directions.

Premiered via GRM Daily, the video for ‚ÄòHot Property‚Äô sees Team Salut collaborating with burgeoning video director and filmmaker Ray Fiasco, who has previously worked with the likes of Tinie Tempah, Krept & Konan, Bonkaz and Shakka, to deliver a lively, energetic and eye-catching visual affair, which not only brings the already infectious record further to life, but also highlights Team Salut as true performing artists, with vibrant personalities and strong performance prowess. With their pioneering UK ‚ÄòAfroWave‚Äô sound continuing to break ground internationally, and ‚ÄòHeavy‚Äô, their recent production collaboration with Anne-Marie, poised to break into the UK Top 40, as well as another anticipated party for Boxpark on November 16, with Kenny Allstar, DJ P Montana, and special guest Afro B, Team Salut are having a impressive final few months of the year, and with ‚ÄòHot Property‚Äô continuing to spread like wildfire across the country, the London trio are fast becoming strong contenders for ones to watch in 2018. Speaking about the video for ‚ÄòHot Property‚Äô, Team Salut say, ‚ÄúThese are the hottest artists in the scene and we as Team Salut are bringing them together. Having put our stamp as producers on huge tracks like ‚ÄòDance For Me‚Äô, ‚ÄòMinor‚Äô and ‚ÄòStay Winning‚Äô, this is our video debut as outright artists. The video reflects the vibe of the music, but more than that ‚Äì the video reflects the vibe of all us guys together under one flag‚Äù.",

      "text": "Some see abortion move as England forcing its values upon NI: MP Anti-abortion protesters outside the recently-opened Marie Stopes private clinic in Belfast in October 2012 Published: 23:09   \nPro-life figures have hit out after the Tory government unveiled details of how it intends to cater for Northern Irish women having publicly-funded abortions in England. \nThe government said a single hotline for booking abortion appointments for Northern Irish women will be set up by the end of the year, and made clear that certain women who opt to get terminations will have their travel costs paid for, as well as the procedure itself. Anti-abortion protesters outside the new Marie Stopes private clinic in Belfast city centre in October 2012 \nCampaign group Right to Life dubbed it an ‚Äúanti-democratic disgrace‚Äù, whilst Christian Action, Research and Education said the government ‚Äúshould not overstretch its reach ‚Äì it does not have a mandate to intervene in Northern Ireland‚Äù. \nMeanwhile, DUP MP Gregory Campbell said many people will see it as a the Tory Party trying to ‚Äúforce particular moral values from England on Northern Ireland‚Äù ‚Äì though he added he was ‚Äúnot suggesting this was the case‚Äù himself. \nDespite its pact with the pro-life DUP, the government had revealed a plan to fully subsidise abortions for Northern Irish women who travel to England back in June, and Monday‚Äôs announcement saw it make clear some of the details of the proposals. \nIt came ahead of a major court hearing on Tuesday in London, which centres on the Human Rights Commission‚Äôs argument that the Province‚Äôs stricter abortion rules clash with human rights law. \nSpeaking of the fresh details of the plan to subsidise Northern Irish women having abortions in England, Gregory Campbell said pro-life campaigners ‚Äúwould probably strongly contend that this is an attempt to try and add pressure to get the ‚Äò67 Act implemented in Northern Ireland‚Äù. \nThe 1967 Abortion Act ‚Äì which became law 50 years ago this Friday ‚Äì liberalised the law in the UK, but does not apply to Northern Ireland. \nHowever, Mr Campbell went on to say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that I would particularly see it like that, but there‚Äôd be many who would.‚Äù He suggested time will tell if that is the case. \nAt the time of the DUP-Tory pact he said media coverage ‚Äúinsinuated the Conservatives need to be careful because the DUP could be trying to force ‚Äòour moral values‚Äô, as they described them, on Conservatives in England‚Äù. \nHe added: ‚ÄúOur response to that was we weren‚Äôt trying to do that. \n‚ÄúAnd we just hoped the reverse wouldn‚Äôt be the case ‚Äì there wouldn‚Äôt be someone in Great Britain in the Conservative Party trying to force particular moral values from England on Northern Ireland. \n‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôm not suggesting this is the case. \n‚ÄúBut there will be many who will look at it like that.‚Äù \nHe added the issue of abortion will not strain the relationship between then DUP and Tories, because the confidence-and-supply arrangement between the two ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt include issues like abortion‚Äù. \nOn June 29, the government said it will subsidise the cost of abortions for Northern Irish women in England. \nFew details were provided at the time. Now, in a written update to Parliament, the minister for women Justine Greening (who is also secretary of state for education) said Northern Irish women could avail of ‚Äúsupport with travel costs if the woman meets financial hardship criteria‚Äù. \nShe also said the government is ‚Äúestablishing a central booking service‚Äù with a single telephone number, which will be set up before the end of the year. \nPeter Williams, executive officer with England-based group Right to Life said: ‚ÄúThis is an utterly unjustifiable interference in a matter that is the sole purview of the Stormont Assembly and Executive, and undermines the already sensitive situation of Northern Irish devolution... \n‚ÄúIt is also occurring without any Parliamentary scrutiny in Westminster or public consultation.‚Äù \nNola Leach, CEO of Christian Action Research and Education (also based in England), said: ‚ÄúThe offer of funding for a free abortion in another country is short-sighted as it neglects any mention of an offer of counselling or care for the woman.‚Äù \nMs Greening‚Äôs statement added: ‚ÄúIn the meantime women from Northern Ireland will continue to make their own arrangements with the providers, but will not be charged. \n‚ÄúMy original statement was clear this does not change the position in relation to the provision of abortions in Northern Ireland, which is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly.‚Äù \nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court in London will hear a case being brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which centres on abortion in cases of rape, incest, and fatal foetal anomaly. \nIt argues that the Province‚Äôs existing law is ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù with the European Convention on Human Rights in the way it restricts abortions in such circumstances.

It also plans to expand its portfolio of cell sites and improve operational efficiency across the organisation. \nSimon Beresford-Wylie, CEO of Arqiva said: ‚ÄúConnectivity is key to the growth and on-going competitiveness of the British economy. \n‚ÄúArqiva provides the critical infrastructure and skilled workforce that ensures the effective operation of the UK‚Äôs television, radio, telecoms and smart meters. We are at the heart of communications and enablers of the vibrant digital economy. \n‚ÄúThe Group‚Äôs strong cash flows and stable, long term capital structure will allow Arqiva to invest in its operations to drive future growth and pay a generous dividend. We are very much looking forward to bringing our unique combination of leading assets and skills to the public markets.‚Äù",

      "text": "Tweet Tomas Alfredson‚Äôs Let the Right One In is among the films available on horror service Shudder. Photograph: Magnolia Home Entertainment/Allstar \nStill subscribing to Netflix ? How mainstream. Niche streaming services ‚Äì especially ones that claim to ‚Äúcurate‚Äù their offering ‚Äì are springing up. Some (such as Brown Sugar , which streams Blaxploitation films and films and TV shows aimed at a black audience) are available only in the US, while others (such as the comedy streaming service Seeso ) are already closing down . Here are just a few of those on offer. Shudder ($4.99 a month; available in the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada) \nLive your life in a permanent state of shock, with as much horror ‚Äì schlocky, classic, comic, international ‚Äì as you can take. Hayu (¬£3.99 a month; UK, Ireland and Australia) \nThis reality-TV streaming service features the Kardashians , obviously, plus every flavour of Real Housewife . More niche programmes include Shahs of Sunset and the cosmetic-surgery-gone-wrong show Botched. Mubi (¬£5.99 a month; UK) \nEvery day, an expert-selected movie is added to this service (think classic, independent, global cinema) and another removed. You have 30 days to watch each title, the idea being that you don‚Äôt get the same paralysis of choice as you do with the all-you-can-watch services, plus your film-watching life is curated by someone who knows more than you do. (Also consider the British Film Institute‚Äôs streaming service, BFI Player .) Yaddo (¬£3.99 a month; worldwide) \nAn all-documentary network that can be viewed anywhere in the world. It is run by Nick Fraser , formerly the head of the BBC‚Äôs Storyville strand. Walter Presents (free; UK) \nWalter Iuzzolino is that insufferable friend who grew up watching Fellini when you were slackjawed in front of Postman Pat. Admittedly, this makes him a good curator of foreign-language TV and films for this streaming service for lovers of subtitles from Channel 4. Section II (pay as you watch; worldwide) \nA small but growing site showcasing lesbian drama from around the world, with films available to rent or buy on the site, plus one original series (so far). It also functions as a library of lesbian and queer female films, with links to where to watch them. Dekkoo ($11.99 a month; worldwide) \nDedicated to showcasing cinema and TV aimed at gay men, Dekkoo has also moved into original programming via the series Feral , which is set in the US bible belt. Crunchyroll (some free content, premium subscriptions from ¬£4.99 a month; worldwide) \nHead here for anime, manga and some (mostly Japanese) live-action films. It is also a community, with some lively forums. Spuul (free with ads or $4.99 a month; worldwide) \nFor all the Bollywood you can take, with thousands of hours of films in Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil and other regional languages. The Netflix-style site makes it easy to find films by category.",

Despite losing a few positions at the start, he was able to bounce back with brilliant driving skills.\"Sainz Jr.'s Renault team-mate, Nico H√ºlkenberg, failed to finish due to a drop in oil pressure.",

The comments came days after the Senate voted for a budget blueprint that cleared a critical hurdle allowing Republicans to push ahead with the first major revision of the tax code since the 1980s. Most investors believe that a tax overhaul will give the dollar at least a temporary boost.\n\"The dollar has some modest wind in its sales for the moment and we still see this persisting for the rest of the year,\" said Steven Barrow, head of G10 foreign-exchange strategy at Standard Bank, in a note to clients.\nInvestors will also be keeping an eye out for the U.S. Commerce Department's advance estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product, due out Friday.\nThe euro was recently down 0.3% at $1.17515. The dollar was up 0.2% at Y113.71.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at [email protected]",

The Administrative Council, according to the Suepo letter, paved the way with ‚Äúunprecedented requirements‚Äù put in the vacancy notice for the top position. The notice included a request for ‚Äúan outstanding ability to engage in social dialogue.‚Äù For Suepo, this is an indication of the Council‚Äôs desire ‚Äúto re-establish harmonious working conditions‚Äù and ‚Äúto dissipate the atmosphere generated over the past few years.‚Äù \nLooking ahead, the union recommended a multilateral working group between management and staff to address a number of issues. The working group should set out on a truth-finding mission and consider, according to SUEPO‚Äôs call, ‚Äúconcrete action where necessary‚Äù on violations of law and staff welfare. \nIt should also consider reversing rather politically motivated sanctions of all staff representatives and union leaders and identify problems with reforms initiated by Battistelli to push efficiency, it said. Suepo, the letter states, is prepared to fully support such efforts. \nAt a recent event with the newly elected chair of the EPO Administrative Council, a considerable number of patent lawyers expressed their support for changes at the EPO which due to the pressure on its staff was producing substandard search reports ( IPW , Europe, 16 October 2017 ). \nCampinos is not due to take office until July 2018.",

      "text": "Laws & Regulations 1568 \nBRUSSELS, Belgium ‚Äì Last Friday, 20 October 2017, the European Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Union a ‚ÄúNotice of initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of electric bicycles originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China.‚Äù Dumping investigation must be finished by 20 January 2019 but provisional dumping duty could be imposed much earlier.. ‚Äì Photo Bike Europe \nThe Notice says that the European Commission has received a complaint on dumping by China of electric bicycles by the European Bicycle Manufacturers Association (EBMA) on behalf of producers representing more than 25 % of the total Union production of electric bicycles. This complaint was lodged on 8 September 2017. Significant dumping margins \nThe 20 October Notice further says ‚ÄúThe information available to the Commission contains a comparison of the normal value with the export price (at ex-works level) of the product under investigation when sold for export to the Union. On this basis the dumping margins calculated are significant for the country concerned.‚Äù Negative impact \nNext to significant dumping margins the in the Official EU Journal published document also says that evidence has been provided that the e-bike import from China into the EU has increased overall both in absolute terms and in terms of market share. And that this has had ‚ÄúA negative impact on the quantities sold, the level of prices charged and the market share held by the Union industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation of the Union industry. ‚Äù E-bikes and speed pedelecs \nThe European Commission‚Äôs investigation focusses on 25km/h ‚Äì 250W e-bikes as well as speed pedelecs which have been imported from China from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017 (‚Äòthe investigation period‚Äô). The ‚ÄòNotice‚Äô says further ‚ÄúThe examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury will cover the period from 1 January 2014 to the end of the investigation period.‚Äù Time schedule \nThe statutory time schedule for dumping investigations carried out by the European Commission stipulates that it must be concluded within 15 months of the date of the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. This means that by 20 January 2019 the investigation must be finished.However, long before that date a provisional anti-dumping duty could be imposed on the e-bike import from China. Depending on the investigators findings already by July 2018 such a provisional anti-dumping duty could be imposed. \nFor more see on this page the complete document with the official announcement by the European Commission on the start of the dumping investigation. It contains all investigation details. Published by Jack Oortwijn on 23 Oct 2017 last update: 23 Oct 2017",

      "text": "23 OCT We know you've heard it before: seasonal migratory patterns bring an increased risk of disease-carrying birds interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. But the health and safety of our U.S. poultry flock is important enough to make it worth repeating. Birds, particularly waterfowl like ducks and geese, can carry avian influenza without showing any symptoms or signs of disease. Because the risk of introduction never goes away, having strong biosecurity practices on poultry operations can help prevent the spread of infectious disease before it starts. The 2014-2015 U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak is never far from my mind. It forced us to reevaluate our preparedness and response capabilities, from a federal, state, and industry standpoint. Today, we are all better prepared to handle and quickly respond to avian influenza detections.

      "text": "- by admin \nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/aQiwRbJRYLo/hqdefault.jpgThe 1903 advent of heavier-than-air fixed-wing aircraft was closely followed in 1910 by the first experimental take-off of an airplane, made from the deck of a United States Navy vessel (cruiser USS Birmingham), and the first experimental landings were conducted in 1911. On 9 May 1912 the first airplane take-off from a ship underway was made from the deck of the British Royal Navy‚Äôs HMS Hibernia. Seaplane tender support ships came next, with the French Foudre of 1911. In September 1914 the Imperial Japanese Navy Wakamiya conducted the world‚Äôs first successful ship-launched air raid: on 6 September 1914 a Farman aircraft launched by Wakamiya attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser Kaiserin Elisabeth and the German gunboat Jaguar in Kiaochow Bay off Tsingtao; neither was hit. The development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships. In 1918, HMS Argus became the world‚Äôs first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft. As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battle cruisers, or battleships. These conversions gave rise to Lexington-class aircraft carriers (1927), Akagi and Courageous-class. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s, resulting in the commissioning of ships such as H≈çsh≈ç (1922), HMS Hermes (1924), and B√©arn(1927). During World War II, these ships would become the backbone of the carrier forces of the United States, British, and Japanese navies, known as fleet carriers.",

      "text": "Print \nThe one goal that unites all socialists ‚Äì from fascists to democratic socialists to communists ‚Äì remains a powerful central government that, to one extent or another, controls property and the economy, either by force or through the expressions of the ‚Äúpopular will.‚Äù \nThroughout history, socialists of different stripes have employed many different ideologies and strategies to promote government control of property and the economy. \nToday, in America, on college campuses, in the media and through other powerful cultural institutions, a new ideology called ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù is employing ‚Äúethnic unity,‚Äù to the exclusion of one race, as the latest effort to promote more expansive socialist government power. \nOn the surface, it‚Äôs obviously a bad idea ‚Äì devoid of reason, morality, truth, justice, personal freedom, individual rights. \nYet, what would one expect from promoters of socialism ‚Äì an ideology that has failed whenever and wherever it has been tried? ‚Äã‚Äã \nIt occurs to me that ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù has a forerunner. It is not a new idea at all. It was employed by socialists in the not-too-distant past. In fact, its progenitor was not Derrick Bell, but Adolf Hitler. \nFanatically, Hitler preached that one privileged race needed to be brought down, even eradicated, for the common good. Likewise, today‚Äôs ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù proposes that another privileged race ‚Äì whites ‚Äì needs to be brought down for the common good. \nAs a reminder, here‚Äôs what Hitler said in a speech titled ‚ÄúWhy We Are Anti-Semites‚Äù in Munich in 1920 ‚Äì just 98 years ago: \n‚ÄúSocialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one‚Äôs fellow man‚Äôs sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income. And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.‚Äù \nFor Hitler, race was destiny. And for today‚Äôs ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù proponents, race is destiny. Both movements ‚Äì Nazism and CRE ‚Äì sought or seek to use government as the instrument of defining ‚Äúguilty‚Äù and ‚Äúexploitative‚Äù races. \nHitler put it this way in another speech, in 1922: ‚ÄúThere are no such things as classes: they cannot be. Class means caste and caste means race.‚Äù \nHitler preached ‚Äúethnic unity‚Äù of non-Semitic whites as his utopian ideal. Hitler‚Äôs immediate target was the Jews, but his racism extended far beyond the Jews. Likewise, today‚Äôs ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù proponents say they want to break up what has become the equivalent of a caste system in America through non-white ‚Äúethnic unity.‚Äù Interestingly, on college campuses in America today, the Jews have been targeted with a special form of victimization. \nBoth the Nazis and today‚Äôs CRE proponents spread their ideology through storytelling rather than through empiric data. They are both emotional pleas based more on feelings of being oppressed and victimized rather than on objective realities. \nBut the most striking similarity between the two ideologies is simply the emphasis on race, power and ‚Äúprivilege.‚Äù‚ÄúPrivilege‚Äù is usually defined by economics and power. Hitler attempted to exterminate the Jews in Europe because they were not ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù and because they supposedly experienced undo ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù and power. \nIs it a perfect analogy? By no means. Nor do I suggest that the Nazi threat faced by Jews is comparable with any inconvenience or discrimination experienced by whites in America today. That‚Äôs not the point at all; though, it will undoubtedly be suggested by critics of this commentary. \nThe danger is this: It‚Äôs unequivocally wrong to racialize America when it has been nearly universally de-racialized ‚Äì especially when the purpose is to further empower government over the sovereign individual. \nAnd the further lesson is this: Racism is always a bad thing ‚Äì even when it is used, supposedly, in overcoming its vestiges. Creating new victims can never correct the injustices of past victimization and prejudices.",

He will then head to India.\n\"We have made some very specific requests of Pakistan in order for them to take action to undermine the support the Taliban receives and other terrorist organizations receive,\" Tillerson said.\nPakistan has denied that it harbors terrorists and said the United States is using Islamabad as a \"scapegoat\" for its own failure to win the war in Afghanistan.\nWith reporting by dpa, AFP, and Reuters",

      "text": "Bowe Bergdahl: Was his action cowardly? Exclusive: Lt. Col. James Zumwalt previews sentencing of sergeant who abandoned post Published: 1 hour ago Lt. Col. James Zumwalt About | Email | Archive Lt. Col. James G. Zumwalt is a retired Marine infantry officer who served in the Vietnam war, the U.S. invasion of Panama and the first Gulf war. He is the author of three books on the Vietnam war, North Korea and Iran as well as hundreds of op-eds. Print \nOn Oct. 16, U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl pleaded guilty to desertion and endangering his fellow soldiers, who spent time searching for him (i.e., misbehavior before the enemy) when he walked away from his unit in Afghanistan in 2009. No plea deal was made for him to so plead. Thus, a sentencing hearing begins Wednesday. \nDesertion carries a maximum sentence of five years; the more serious plea of misbehavior carries a maximum life sentence. It will be interesting to see whether his defense team, seeking to minimize his punishment, argues that while Bergdahl is a deserter, he was not a coward. \nWe think of a coward as one who, refusing to perform his combat responsibilities, seeks safety behind friendly lines ‚Äì i.e., safety from the enemy he is fleeing. Bergdahl did not seek out any such ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù within which to cower. Instead, he left his post, weapon and the obvious safety of friendly lines to enter into enemy territory. \nIt is difficult to understand what went through his mind as he did so. Was he motivated more by the fear of being deemed a coward by his fellow soldiers had he sought such safety behind friendly lines than he was about confronting an uncertain future in the hands of the Taliban? The thought had to cross his mind, in leaving his post, he might never again make his way back to safety, running the risk as well of becoming another beheading victim. In effect, he was departing the safety of Fort Apache and entering into unknown Indian territory. \nBergdahl‚Äôs email communications with his parents indicate he had become disillusioned with the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and was contemplating desertion. He had written them he was ‚Äúashamed to be an American.‚Äù Just three days before deserting, in discussing the Afghans, he told his parents, ‚ÄúThese people need help, yet what they get is the most conceited country in the world telling them that they are nothing and that they are stupid.‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äã \nBut it is difficult to envision Bergdahl‚Äôs personal disillusionment and desire to desert proving a stronger draw than the reality of the known brutality of an enemy into whose hands he would eventually fall. The will to live normally overrides the will to die, and he had to know he was walking into the valley of the shadow of death. \nArguably, what Bergdahl did was not indistinguishable from what another American soldier had done 55 years earlier. In 1962, Joe Dresnok, serving on the DMZ between North and South Korea, deserted his command , running northward through minefields to do so. For 44 years, no one heard anything more about Dresnok until two British filmmakers were allowed to document the soldier‚Äôs post-defection life in North Korea. At least three other American soldiers also defected around the same time, providing Pyongyang with a propaganda bonanza. \nWhether or not these Americans did not understand what they were getting themselves into, they, too, deserted ‚Äúinto,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúin,‚Äù the face of the enemy. It is doubtful the life they lived in the Communist North was one an older and wiser soldier would have voluntarily undertaken. But, once they crossed the DMZ, there was turning back as all were at the mercy of their North Korean hosts. \nBy entering into the enemy‚Äôs domain, as much as one would like to label him a coward, Bergdahl is not. We can only assume either he, like Dresnok, was simply blind to the reality he would face in enemy hands or was so despondent about his situation he cared not what he faced as an alternative. \nAs Bergdahl claimed there were 12 to 15 times during his five-year ordeal in Taliban hands he tried to escape, the reality of what he had done undoubtedly sank in at some point, albeit too late. \nWhat the judge in his case also will consider is how Bergdahl‚Äôs actions endangered other soldiers. As search missions were launched after he went missing, the lives of Bergdahl‚Äôs fellow soldiers were needlessly placed at risk. While there is no indication any lives were lost, at least three suffered severe wounds. \nAdditionally, the judge will need consider the benefits the enemy gained by Bergdahl‚Äôs desertion. These run the gamut from a propaganda victory, to possible intelligence about U.S. tactics and operations gained by interrogating him, to the huge benefit of obtaining the release of five major Taliban leaders in 2014 held at Guantanamo in exchange for Bergdahl‚Äôs release. Since then, these ‚ÄúGuantanamo Five‚Äù ‚Äì now residing in terrorist-friendly Qatar‚Äîhave returned to conducting their terrorist-planning activities. From there, they will continue their efforts to kill Americans who, unlike Bergdahl, are fulfilling their combat responsibilities. \nBergdahl‚Äôs is a most unique desertion case. There is more than just a subtle difference between ‚Äúdesertion in the face of the enemy‚Äù and ‚Äúdesertion into the face of the enemy.‚Äù \nTwo other considerations will factor in as well in his sentencing. One works to Bergdahl‚Äôs advantage ‚Äì the five-year period he already spent in captivity, which, ironically, corresponds with the five-year maximum sentence for desertion. The other works against him, as desertion on the battlefield is a cancer that, if not appropriately addressed, will spread. \nWhile Bergdahl‚Äôs actions must be punished, the judge will be challenged to hand down a sentence befitting of the crimes, and under the circumstances they took place.",

      "text": "WordPress.org Testing javascript in a dockerized rails application with rspec-rails \nThe other day I wanted to add support for tests of javascript functionality in a (dockerized) rails application using rspec-rails. \nSince rails 5.1 includes system tests with niceties like automatically taking a screenshot on failed tests, I hoped for a way to benefit from this features without changing to another test framework. Lucky me ‚Äì only recently the authors of rspec-rails added support for so-called system specs. There is not much documentation so far (but there are a lot of useful information in the corresponding bug report #1838 and a friendly guy named Thomas Walpole ( @twalpole ) is helpfully answering to questions in that issue. \nTo make things a little bit more complicated: the application in question is usually running in a docker container and thus the tests of the application are also run in a docker container. I didn‚Äôt want to change this, so here is what it took me to get this running. Overview \nLet‚Äôs see what we want to achieve exactly: From a technical point of view, we will have the application under test (AUT) and the tests in one container (let‚Äôs call it: web) and we will need another container running a javascript-capable browser (let‚Äôs call it browser). \nThus we need the tests to drive a remote running browser (at least when running in a docker environment) which needs to access the application under a different address than usually. Namely an address reachable by the chrome -container, since it will not be reachable via 127.0.0.1 as is (rightfully) assumed by default. \nIf we want Warden authentication stubbing to work (as we do, since our application uses Devise) and transactional fixtures as well (e.g. rails handling database cleanup between tests without database_cleaner gem) we also need to ensure that the application server is being started by the tests and the tests are actually run against that server. Otherwise we might run into problems. Getting the containers ready \nAssuming you already have a container setup (and are using docker-compose like we do) there is not that much to change on the docker front. Basically you need to add a new service called chrome and point it to an appropriate image and add a link to it in your existing web -container. \nI‚Äôve decided to use standalone-chrome for the browser part, for which there are docker images provided by the selenium project (they also have images for other browsers). Kudos for that. ... services: chrome: image: selenium/standalone-chrome ‚Ä¶ web: ‚Ä¶ links: - chrome 1",

PUBLISHED: 22:07, Mon, Oct 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:22, Mon, Oct 23, 2017 \nBuried in a report on ‚Äúminimum income schemes‚Äù by the European Union Parliament‚Äôs Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, MEPs advocated providing an income ‚Äúthat is above the poverty line‚Äù and added the moves should be accompanied by ‚Äúthe provision of public services such as health, education and childcare‚Äù. \nAlthough the report has not been ratified by the EU Parliament and it has not legislative power as any directive by the body can be voted down by individual states, it can be seen as a further move by the bloc to increasingly interfere in people‚Äôs lives. \nAreas such as healthcare provision and childcare issues have not been of concern for the EU and previously seen as the domain of individual countries to decide. \nA vote for the measures by the EU Parliament could open the door for the Brussels apparatchiks to start dictating over a country‚Äôs domestic policies and start imposing their rules and regulations into the minute details of people‚Äôs lives. Getty/EPA The EU wants to gain control of areas such as health and childcare \nBuried further in the report, MEPs discuss people‚Äôs minimum income ‚Äúto meet people‚Äôs fundamental needs, including also non-monetary aspects, such as access to education and lifelong learning, decent housing, quality healthcare services, social activities and civic participation‚Äù. \nIn the report, written by Italian left-winger Laura Agea, the explanatory statement says: ‚ÄúThe minimum income scheme should be coupled with a strategic approach aiming at social integration; to that end, it is recommended that effective social protection measures regarding parts of people‚Äôs lives such as the guarantee of housing, health care, education and training, should be adopted in parallel with the implementation of the minimum income scheme.‚Äù \nThe report comes at a time when there are strong factions with the member states seemingly pulling in different directions.

      "text": "Staff Union Welcomes Next EPO President, Hopes For Dialogue 23/10/2017 by Intellectual Property Watch Leave a Comment   is a   service and depends   \nIn a letter to its members, the Staff Union of the European Patent Office (SUEPO) in The Hague, Netherlands has welcomed the election of Antonio Campinos as new President of the EPO a week ago, expressed hope for a change in EPO management-workforce relations and has some recommendations for next steps. \nThe union has gone all the way to the European Court of Human Rights with a complaint against what it claims are ‚Äúviolations of fundamental rights and an apparent systematic disregard for the rule of law‚Äù and ‚Äúmanagement by fear, isolation and punishment‚Äù by the outgoing EPO President Benoit Battistelli. \nIn the 18 October letter [pdf] to its colleagues obtained by Intellectual Property Watch , it calls for a renewed dialogue over working conditions and staff welfare. The Administrative Council, according to the Suepo letter, paved the way with ‚Äúunprecedented requirements‚Äù put in the vacancy notice for the top position. The notice included a request for ‚Äúan outstanding ability to engage in social dialogue.‚Äù For Suepo, this is an indication of the Council‚Äôs desire ‚Äúto re-establish harmonious working conditions‚Äù and ‚Äúto dissipate the atmosphere generated over the past few years.‚Äù \nLooking ahead, the union recommended a multilateral working group between management and staff to address a number of issues. The working group should set out on a truth-finding mission and consider, according to SUEPO‚Äôs call, ‚Äúconcrete action where necessary‚Äù on violations of law and staff welfare. \nIt should also consider reversing rather politically motivated sanctions of all staff representatives and union leaders and identify problems with reforms initiated by Battistelli to push efficiency, it said. Suepo, the letter states, is prepared to fully support such efforts. \nAt a recent event with the newly elected chair of the EPO Administrative Council, a considerable number of patent lawyers expressed their support for changes at the EPO which due to the pressure on its staff was producing substandard search reports ( IPW , Europe, 16 October 2017 ). \nCampinos is not due to take office until July 2018.",

This complaint was lodged on 8 September 2017. Significant dumping margins \nThe 20 October Notice further says ‚ÄúThe information available to the Commission contains a comparison of the normal value with the export price (at ex-works level) of the product under investigation when sold for export to the Union. On this basis the dumping margins calculated are significant for the country concerned.‚Äù Negative impact \nNext to significant dumping margins the in the Official EU Journal published document also says that evidence has been provided that the e-bike import from China into the EU has increased overall both in absolute terms and in terms of market share. And that this has had ‚ÄúA negative impact on the quantities sold, the level of prices charged and the market share held by the Union industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation of the Union industry. ‚Äù E-bikes and speed pedelecs \nThe European Commission‚Äôs investigation focusses on 25km/h ‚Äì 250W e-bikes as well as speed pedelecs which have been imported from China from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017 (‚Äòthe investigation period‚Äô). The ‚ÄòNotice‚Äô says further ‚ÄúThe examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury will cover the period from 1 January 2014 to the end of the investigation period.‚Äù Time schedule \nThe statutory time schedule for dumping investigations carried out by the European Commission stipulates that it must be concluded within 15 months of the date of the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. This means that by 20 January 2019 the investigation must be finished.However, long before that date a provisional anti-dumping duty could be imposed on the e-bike import from China. Depending on the investigators findings already by July 2018 such a provisional anti-dumping duty could be imposed. \nFor more see on this page the complete document with the official announcement by the European Commission on the start of the dumping investigation. It contains all investigation details. Published by Jack Oortwijn on 23 Oct 2017 last update: 23 Oct 2017",

First Light Imaging Europarc Sainte-Victoire, 13590 Meyreuil, France Favorites QUESTION Infrared Interferometry: First Light Imaging‚Äôs C-RED One is looking at the sky! \nMeyreuil, October 18, 2017: MIRC-X, the 6-telescope beam combination instrument developed by the University of Exeter (UK) and the University of Michigan (USA), together with C-RED One, the world‚Äôs fastest low noise infrared camera from First Light Imaging, are opening new perspectives in Infrared Interferometry for Astronomy. \nThe MIRC-X imager is now looking at the sky on the CHARA telescope array, which is the world‚Äôs highest-resolution imaging facility in infrared light, located at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. The new instrument combines the light from telescopes spaced up to 330 meters apart. These characteristics make the CHARA array and the MIRC-X instrument ideally suited for imaging stellar surface structures or to image the environment around stars with unprecedented resolution. \nThe MIRC-X project is led by Prof. Stefan Kraus (University of Exeter, UK) and Prof. John Monnier (University of Michigan, USA) and funded by the European Research Council (1) and building on earlier funding from the USA‚Äôs National Science Foundation. The ambitious goal is to image the discs around young stars for the first time with 6-telescopes infrared interferometry. These discs constitute the left-over material from the star formation process and provide the stage where planets form. Once planets have formed, they shape the disc environment, for instance by carving out gaps or by stirring up the disc material in warps. Spotting these structures in the inner disc regions requires an angular resolution far beyond the reach of conventional telescopes. MIRC-X and CHARA overcome this resolution barrier by combining the light from physically separated telescopes, achieving the image sharpness of a 330m telescope. These new capabilities will enable astronomers to obtain high-fidelity images of protoplanetary disc, providing a glimpse on how our own solar system might have looked like 4.6 billion years ago, during its formation phase. \nC-RED One is a scientific commercial camera developed by First Light Imaging, dedicated to short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging. It is based on the SAPHIRA e-APD detector from LEONARDO, allowing avalanche amplification and multiplication of electrons. C-RED One‚Äôs innovative mechanics and electronics offers unprecedented speed and sensitivity records: 3500 frames per second, with a read-out noise lower than 1 electron. \nSo far, the sensitivity of infrared interferometric instruments has been limited primarily by the read-noise of the detectors that are used for recording the faint interference pattern formed by the starlight. The C-RED One‚Äôs e-APD technology reduces these read-noise contributions by several orders of magnitudes, enabling MIRC-X to detect the faint interference pattern associated with protoplanetary discs. \nC-RED One is the only commercially-available infrared camera based on the e-APD Technology. The three-year development of the C-RED One has been funded by the European Commission in the frame of the Horizon 2020 (2) SME Instrument program. In 2016, C-RED One was rewarded with a Prism Award for Photonics Innovation by SPIE / PhotonicsMedia. \nFor more information about C-RED One: www.first-light.fr/c-red-one-project/ \nFor more information about MIRC-X: http://mircx.skraus.eu \nStart-up created in 2011, emanating from public research laboratories (3), First Light Imaging designs and manufactures high-technology scientific cameras for both visible and infrared spectra. The company has already been funded twice by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research and the Public Investment Bank (BPI) in France. OCAM¬≤, C-RED One and C-RED 2 are the world‚Äôs fastest and most sensitive cameras for visible or infrared wavelengths. They already chosen by the world‚Äôs biggest telescopes and institutes, such as the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii or GranTeCan in Spain. First Light Imaging also brings its expertise to the NASA space agency. \nContacts: David Boutolleau ‚Äì CEO +33 620262038 ‚Äì david.boutolleau@first-light.fr \nJean-Luc Gach ‚Äì Scientific Advisor +33 785608464 ‚Äì jeanluc.gach@first-light.fr \n(1) MIRC-X is funded in parts through the European Research Council (ERC) as part of grant agreement No 639889. \n(2) C-RED One: The project leading to this application has received funding from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 673944. \n(3) Marseille Astrophysics Laboratory (CNRS-INSU and Aix-Marseille University), IPAG (Grenoble Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics), OHP (Haute ‚ÄìProvence Observatory, CNRS)",

      "text": "Luxottica confirms 2017 guidance after hurricanes hit third quarter 23 October 2017 Ray-Ban maker Luxottica on Monday confirmed its 2017 guidance even after reporting weak third-quarter sales as hurricane-related store closures hit North America, its biggest market. Instagram: Luxottica Luxottica CEO Massimo Vian told Reuters sales growth at the world‚Äôs biggest eyewear maker was now more likely to meet the lower part of the range provided as 2017 guidance.‚ÄúWe confirm our guidance ... we will likely be at the lower end of the range,‚Äù Vian said, adding that the first three weeks of October ‚Äúhad a plus sign‚Äù both globally and in North America.Some analysts had flagged the risk Luxottica might have had to tweak its guidance after a disappointing quarter.Luxottica, which is awaiting antitrust approval of its agreed merger with lens maker Essilor, said in March sales would post ‚Äòlow to mid‚Äô single-digit growth this year at constant currencies, with a broadly similar rise in its adjusted operating and net profit.Sales in North America, which last year accounted for 59 percent of the group total, slumped 9 percent in the third quarter and were still down 4 percent when stripping out the effect of a weaker dollar.Luxottica said hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico had forced it to close 570 shops, most of them for longer than a week, and had also hurt its wholesale business.Vian also said a disruption at a data storage supplier had hurt orders at the end of the quarter.‚ÄúBut even net of weather and ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô issues, the performance of (the group‚Äôs North American optical retailer) LensCrafters since mid-August has been below expectations,‚Äù he said.Vian said LensCrafters‚Äô sales in the crucial ‚Äòback to school‚Äô period had been hurt by the chain‚Äôs new promotion strategy aimed at increasing transparency.‚ÄúEither we did not explain it well or the initial reception was not good ... lesson learnt,‚Äù he said in a phone interview.Changes at LensCrafters and the bad weather contributed to a 5 percent drop in comparable-store sales.By contrast sales in Europe, where the group has been expanding its retail network, rose 16 percent at constant currencies in the quarter.Vian said there were no updates on the approval process for the Essilor merger, which is being reviewed by European Union and U.S. antitrust authorities. He said Luxottica remained confident about the outcome.Total sales rose 0.8 percent at constant currencies in July-September to 2.15 billion euros, driven by Luxottica‚Äôs retail business. This compared with a Reuters‚Äô analyst consensus of 2.17 billion euros.Taking into account currency moves, third-quarter sales fell 3.5 percent year-on-year.",

It would leave us more time to prepare for the future relationship.‚Äù \nHowever he warned that the negotiations would continue to be ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù and that agreeing the future relationship between the EU and the UK would take time. \n‚ÄúThe two phases are difficult. The second will be very different and will last several years,‚Äù he said. \n‚ÄúIt is truly unique because instead of promoting regulatory convergence, it will aim to frame a difference. \n‚ÄúIt will involve risks, including about its political ratification, making all the more necessary transparency around these topics.‚Äù \nBrexit Secretary David Davis reacts during a media conference with European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (Olivier Matthys/AP) \nHis comments raise new questions as to whether there can be a free trade deal in time for a transition period. \nIn the Commons, Mrs May said it was not possible to have a transition unless they knew what they were transitioning to. \n‚ÄúThe point of the implementation period is to put in place the practical changes necessary to move to the future partnership,‚Äù she said. \n‚ÄúIn order to have that you need to know what the future partnership is going to be.‚Äù",

The two politicians are suspected of a subsidy fraud, and Babis also of harming the EU's financial interests. \nBabis is suspected of formally excluding his Farma Capi Hnizdo (Stork Nest Farm) company from the giant Agrofert holding, of which he was the sole owner, in order to win a EU subsidy worth 50 million crowns, and then making the company part of Agrofert again. Earlier this year, Babis, then occupying the post of deputy prime minister, was forced to transfer Agrofert to trust funds to avoid a conflict of interests. \nThe police have accused 11 people within the Stork Nest case. \nBabis confirmed on Monday that his wife Monika Babisova was among the accused. He again said the case was a fabrication full of lies that aims to harm him. \"My wife has been accused. She is prosecuted because she sold shares to her brother,\" Babis said. \nBoth Babis and Faltynek pleaded innocent. They jointly said other parties used the case against them in the election campaign. \nBabis said on Monday Faltynek definitely will not be in the new government. ANO wants Faltynek to be the head of the party's group in the Chamber of Deputies again, Babis added. \nZenklova said all 11 suspects complained about the criminal prosecution and a state attorney is going to decide on it. She said the prosecution of nine people would continue, though that of Babis and Faltynek would be suspended. \nThe prosecution of the two will be suspended after the election results are officially confirmed, which is likely to be on Tuesday. \nZenklova did not say whether the police would again ask the lower house to strip Babis and Faltynek of their immunity. \nAccording to the E15 news server, all parties except for ANO and the Communists (KSCM) said their MPs would release Babis for prosecution again. \nNearly all parties that entered the new parliament declared that they would not join a government headed a prosecuted politician. Babis insists on occupying the post of prime minister. \nDaily Pravo previously wrote that the accused in the Stork Nest case include Babis's wife, his adult son and daughter, his son-in-law and members of ZZN Pelhrimov firm's board that owned Farma Capi Hnizdo in the past. The alleged fraud occurred about ten years ago. Copyright 2015 by the Czech News Agency (ƒåTK). All rights reserved.

PUBLISHED: 10:33, Tue, Oct 24, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:15, Tue, Oct 24, 2017 \nDavid McAllister, an MEP from Angela Merkel‚Äôs CDU party, told France 24 that the issue was an internal one for Spain. \nBrussels has not intervened in the dispute between Barcelona and Madrid despite a brutal police crack down on an illegal independence referendum and the subsequent suspension of autonomy in Catalonia . \nMr McAllister said: ‚ÄúWell in the moment Catalonia is a case of its own. We had the question of possible Scottish independence in 2014, but I don't see other separatist movements going that far, either provincial government in Catalonia.‚Äù \n‚ÄúBut another argument against the involvement of the EU , or the EU commission is that here, of course, this could be a precedent for other cases. Getty/France 24 The CDU politician warned against intervening Catalonia. \n‚ÄúIf the EU starts negotiating here. Facilitating a dialogue, there could be similar calls coming from Northern Italy, from Flanders in Belgium, or from Corsica and France. \nMr McAllister said he understood some of the demands for autonomy across Europe but that this differed from outright separatist movements. \nHe said: ‚ÄúHonestly, I understand the wish of people having strong regions in Europe and I strongly believe in a Europe of nations, with strong regions.‚Äù \n‚ÄúFor instance, Germany, being a country with sixteen bundeslander, but strong regions are something different from having separatist movements. \n‚ÄúI don't believe that Europe successful if we fall into a dozen of new states.‚Äù \nItaly has been the latest European country to face a surge of support for separatist movements. The regions of Lombardy and Veneto voted for increased autonomy over the weekend. A number of other regions have separatist movements often based around linguistic or ethnic identity. \nMr McAllister is a powerful figure in EU circles and has been referred to as 'Merkel's man in Brussels' due to his close relationship with the German chancellor. \nThe German politician turned his fire on Brexit , which he says he ‚Äòdeeply regretted‚Äô as British people would suffer due to the negative consequences of leaving the bloc.

Rosi Bindi, the president of the Commission described the official visit as an opportunity for dialogue between Malta and Italy to support its commitment to fight organized crime. Yesterday afternoon, Rosi Bindi was present for the mass concelebrated by the Archbishop of Malta Charles J. Scicluna in the church of Bidnija, located just a few meters from the area where the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed last week. \"Our presence here is the best example of solidarity with the Caruana Galizia family and the Maltese people,\" said Bindi. \nThe president of the antimafia Commission confirmed the appeal of Archbishop Scicluna not to abandon or leave Malta alone. This was reinforced during their meeting. Rosi Bindi said that Italy has a long history of violent attacks against journalists, magistrates, police and other officials carrying out their duty. Bindi reaffirmed that Caruana Galizia was assassinated because she always performed her journalistic duty to inform the public. \nThe president of the antimafia Commission referred to drug trafficking, immigration, illegal gambling and smuggling of petrolium as the criminal activities of the Italian Mafia using Malta as their base. \n(ITALPRESS).",

      "text": "Slow greening will cost carmakers billions in European fines 23 October 2017 Consultancy.uk   Large car-manufacturers such as BMW, Volkswagen, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot Citro√´n risk major fines, to the tune of hundreds of millions, if they don‚Äôt radically improve their CO2 footprint. In total, seven out of eleven large carmakers are on course to miss the new European targets, according to a new report ‚Äì while the UK lags behind in the development of electric vehicles, as it struggles to make its 2040 deadline for banning the sale of combustion engine-powered vehicles. Europe is making collective efforts to improve the sustainability of the car industry ‚Äì with the European Commission setting key goal to reduce CO2 emissions. Now, the EU has introduced a new regulation that by 2021 forces carmakers to reach more stringent CO2 emissions criteria. Under the new targets, carmakers must reduce the average emissions of the cars they sell to below 95g of CO2 per km. These new guidelines have sent the automotive industry into panic however, following an analysis which has shown that only four out of eleven large car manufacturers will meet the European CO2 emission targets by 2021. The remaining seven are potentially facing huge fine s, amounting to ‚Ç¨95 per gram of CO2 above the emission limit, multiplied by the number of cars that the manufacturer sells in 2020. At the current rate, Volkswagen, which owns the Audi and Porsche brands, is expected to face the biggest fine, facing a ‚Ç¨1.7 billion fine according to the researches. Volkswagen, which is still facing the consequences of its diesel emissions scandal, is aware of the challenge, and has therefore launched ‚ÄòTogether‚Äô, its strategy to 2025 which it bills as the biggest change in its history. The new strategy focuses on automation, battery development and the production of electric vehicle to improve its CO2 footprint. The change will, however say PA, only have a real impact after 2020, meaning that the fines over CO2 targets is a realistic facing. In PA‚Äôs analysis, which each company has its own individual target, as the EU target takes into account the types of vehicles sold, meaning that a company with smaller average vehicles will face more stringent targets than a group focused mainly on large cars. Under the system, carmakers also receive \"super-credits\" for every fully electric car they sell, allowing them to offset the impact of more polluting vehicles. BMW and Fiat Chrysler Not surprisingly, German rival BMW also are facing a potentially hefty fine, estimated at ‚Ç¨600 million, on the back of its slow progress to electrification ‚Äì sales number of green vehicles are not picking up fast enough to offset the demand for its popular premium and larger petrol and diesel vehicles). The group are forecast to miss their 2021 target by 4g CO2 per km. The second largest fine would meanwhile sting Fiat Chrysler for ‚Ç¨1.2 million. The popularity of Jeep, coupled with heavy weights and high emission rates, and the lack of an alternative drivetrain strategy or options means FCA has increased their average CO2 emissions three times in the last five years (with only a very small reduction in 2016). As a result, they are likely to miss their targets by the highest margin of all the carmakers. They are still only taking small steps towards electrification meanwhile, despite a number of European economies including the UK planning to outlaw the sale of fossil fuelled cars by 2040 . The biggest fall from grace, according to the consultants, who advise many of the manufacturers in the car industry, is Peugeot Citroen, which was set to meet EU emissions targets but now is facing different fortunes. Following the merger with Opel and Vauxhall this year, last year‚Äôs top performer is fifth and forecast to miss their 2021 target by 3g CO2 per km. This reflects the relatively polluting footprint Opel and Vauxhall vehicles have, with the aim that from 2023 85% of PSA‚Äôs portfolio will be electric driven or hybrids coming too late to meet the 2021 target. Volvo is the best performer, jumping to first position from seventh last year. This dramatic change is largely a response to the fact that Volvo rocked the automotive industry by stating that it wants to only produce electric and hybrid vehicles by 2019. This significant step toward the electrification of their fleet also features a plan to introduce at least four plug-in hybrid vehicles by that year, gradually increasing its share of purely electric vehicles after. Toyota remains second, having also significantly improved its CO2 performance for 2021. Other notable companies include Renault-Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover, which for the first time in PA's benchmark are no longer orange, but green. Commenting on the findings of the report, Thomas G√∂ttle, Head of Automotive solutions at PA Consulting Group, said, ‚ÄúCarmakers across Europe need to make radical changes in order to meet the EU CO2 emissions targets for 2021. Many of them need to focus now on developing new models that will appeal to the consumer and help them meet their targets. There is nothing less than a revolution facing the car industry and those manufacturers who fail to keep up face potential fines in the billions.\" Frank Witter, Chief Finance Officer at Volkswagen, has previously said to the Financial Times that the costs of complying with the CO2 targets are the biggest pressure on the group's R&D budget, calling it the \"overarching issue\" for the company. He added, \"The other items, investing and developing new technologies, autonomous driving, connectivity, electrification, are certainly important, but the most critical one is CO2 compliance.\" Progress by country Examining the situation from a national perspective, Norway performs best, with the country‚Äôs manufacturers exhibiting the lowest CO2 emissions (94.2g CO2 / km) and the largest share of newly sold plug-in hybrid and electric cars (29.1%). Norway is also well on-course to ban the combustion engine from 2025. The Netherlands sits in second place in the EU. The emission level seen in the Netherlands was 2017g CO‚ÇÇ / km in 2016 while 5.9% of all new cars sold were electric. The United Kingdom will need to up efforts to realise the ambitions to eradicate the combustion engine by 2040, however. While the time-frame still seems lengthy, the automotive industry is still heavily dependent on conventional engines, and in the meantime, the UK is heading to the bottom of the list of European countries. The development of alternatives in the UK also lags behind other countries. The United Kingdom currently produces 2.5 million internal combustion engines, 15% of the European total, making it difficult for them to switch to electrical options rapidly without upsetting the market. Tracking the improvements? For the European Union and the regulators, the race of the industry towards greener footprint poses challenge how they track the advancements. CO2 emissions performance was derived from a test cycle known as the New European Driving Cycle ‚Äì a standardised procedure designed to compare different vehicles under similar conditions. It has now been replaced in the EU by Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure, which is designed to provide a more accurate representation of real conditions; longer duration, higher speed and including more acceleration and deceleration. With the tests in mind, carmakers are continuously looking at performing as best as they can in the tests, however that might not reflect performance on the road. Analysis also shows that the gap between CO2 emissions and NEDC tests has more than doubled over the past decades: the gap is currently 35% and continues to increase. In the majority of cases car producers are seemingly getting their footing right, however because of this notable gap between tests and results, there remains a large worry that manufacturers may be cheating the tests, as with the recent diesel emissions scandal, bringing the industry‚Äôs reputation into disrepute, while making the EC seem notably weakened as it attempts to set an example to developing economies when dealing with climate change.",

Outside of that the rate of expansion eased off a bit but was still solid,\" he added. \nHarker said the PMI, if maintained, pointed to fourth quarter economic growth of 0.6-0.7%, faster than the 0.5% a recent Reuters poll predicted. \nThe robust growth came as firms increased prices. An output price index climbed to 53.3 from 52.7, its highest reading since June 2011. \nInflation has stubbornly refused to reach the European Central Bank's 2% target ceiling but a recent Reuters poll predicted policymakers will say on Thursday they plan to start trimming monthly asset purchases in January. \nA PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry sank to 54.9 from 55.8, missing all expectations in a Reuters poll that predicted a reading of 55.6. \nBut suggesting firms think the slowdown will not last, they hired staff at the second fastest rate in over nine years. The employment index rose to 54.3 from 53.7 and has only been higher once - in March - since early 2008. \nManufacturing growth accelerated and the PMI came in at 58.6 compared to September's 58.1, its highest since February 2011. It was forecast at 57.8 and was better than anyone polled by Reuters predicted. \nAn index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, dipped to 58.7 from 59.2. \nIndicating the momentum might continue, new orders picked up. The sub index was 58.7 compared to September's 58.5, matching a more than six-year high set in June. More on",

This data will then be made available to businesses such as service providers and developers, who would use it to build travel information websites, online journey planners and other applications. As a result, new and more accurate services to plan journeys across Europe will be available to anyone who needs them. \nThe Delegated Regulation (EU 2017/1926) has been formally published in the EU Official Journal and therefore becomes official EU legislation, to read the document, click here .",

      "text": "The Yorkshire Evening Post fans‚Äô jury has its say after Leeds United 3-0 victory at Ashton Gate. \nDAVID WATKINS 'Spanish Wizard' Samuel Saiz. PIC: Jonathan Gawthorpe \nWell, I certainly didn‚Äôt see that coming! Leeds United found a winning formula again and came back to life as quickly as our form dipped about a month ago. \nThe inclusion of Ronnie Vieira ‚Äì called for by most Leeds fans in recent weeks ‚Äì made a huge difference as did the formation change to include a four-man midfield engine room of Samueal Saiz, Ronaldo Vieira, Eunan O‚ÄôKane and Kalvin Phillips. \nPerhaps we also needed that bit of luck in the fourth minute as a clearance rebounded off Phillips into the path of Pierre-Michel Lasogga before a wicked deflection then guided Saiz‚Äôs shot perfectly into the back of the net. \nYou make your own luck they say and Leeds worked hard to press the home side from the start and they never really troubled us apart from a couple of solid saves from Andy Lonergan. \nThis was the perfect all round performance, and a perfectly timed one to calm everyone‚Äôs nerves. \nMan of the match: Ronaldo Vieira. \nMATTHEW EVANS \nA vastly-improved performance that was as much down to attitude and approach than personnel and positions. \nIt‚Äôs true that Matthew Pennington and Ronaldo Vieira brought some fresh thinking to the side but the application of the players was far better than in recent games and we got exactly what we deserved. \nEarly doors it looked like Bristol could be in for a battering and it was clear that the do-or-die attitude of earlier in the season had returned to the United ranks. \nCity got a foothold in the game and we had some quiet spells but they never looked like threatening. \nTheir frustration boiled over late on with Taylor and Berardi shown deserved red cards. A solid performance at the back was topped by excellent performances from Vieira, Alioski and Saiz ‚Äì further forward ‚Äì while Lasogga enjoyed a best showing since his debut. \nKalvin Phillips was the star of the show, however, just as the more fickle of our fans had begun to write him off ‚Äì once again. \nIt was a much-needed boost ahead of a tough game at Leicester but we should go there with no inhibitions and try to make the quarter -inals for the second year in a row. \nMan of the match: Kalvin Phillips. \nKEITH INGHAM \nJust when it seemed it was going a little sideways, Leeds stormed back with a fantastic 3-0 win over fourth-placed Bristol City. \nThe win ‚Äòleapfrogs‚Äô Leeds over their hosts and they now sit fourth in the Championship table. Leeds dominated the early minutes and were 2-0 up by the 15th minute, Samuel Siaz with both the goals. \nLeeds increased their lead in the second half when Pierre-Michel Lasogga headed in Kalvin Phillips‚Äô corner. \nThe only blot on a superb performance was Gaetano Berardi‚Äôs sending off 11 minutes from time. \nBristol City‚Äôs Matt Taylor was also sent off for involvement in the same incident. Berardi now misses the next three games against Leicester, Sheffield United and Derby County. \nThomas Christainsen showed that despite recent set backs he has the tactical nouse to alter things to counter different teams. He certainly did his homework on in-form Bristol City and the results were there for all to see. \nA superb victory! \nA cup tie against Leicester City tomorrow awaits and expect a few changes with the Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United only a few days afterwards. \nMan of the match: All the team deserve credit. \nGARY NEWBOULD \nAs hurricane Brian descended, it was United who produced a barnstorming performance at Ashton Gate on Saturday afternoon to record a 3-0 victory and head back up to fourth in the Championship. \nAfter three miserable defeats on the bounce for the Whites and the hosts unbeaten in more than ten games, logic suggested there was little chance of an away victory. \nBut when did logic ever apply in the Championship? \nThe loyal hordes, who numbered almost 4,000, welcomed the inclusion of Ronaldo Vieira on the starting XI, but were shocked by Pontus Jansson being dropped to the bench and replaced by Matthew Pennington. However, the Swede himself had described his own recent performances as, shall we say, ‚Äòpoor‚Äô on social media over the week. \nUnited were quickly out of the traps and by the time 14 minutes were on the clock they were two goals to the good and leaving Elland Road‚Äôs ‚ÄòSpanish Wizard‚Äô Samuel Saiz having over an hour left to claim a hat-trick. \nThe quality of football totally justified the change of personnel and formation and a third and final goal came just after the hour mark, courtesy of Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who looked much more full of energy throughout. \nMan of the match: Ronaldo Vieira. \nMIKE GILL \nBRISTOL CITY boss Lee Johnson said before the game that City had not been comprehensively beaten by anybody this season. \nWell they have now! As expected Leeds United strengthened up the midfield adding the muscular Ronaldo Vieira. Matthew Pennington was preferred to Pontus Jansson and Gjanni Alioski returned to the starting line-up. \nVieira‚Äôs inclusion allowed the excellent Samuel Saiz to remind us what he is capable of. \nTwo well-taken goals in 14 minutes sent Bristol City reeling and United dominated the first half. \nApart from about ten or so minutes, the second half followed along the same lines. \nWhen a revitalised Pierre-Michel Lasogga scored a fine header from a Kalvin Phillips corner on 67 minutes, the game was all but over. \nThe euphoria at the beginning of the season was probably misplaced ‚Äì as was the doom and gloom of recent times. \nWhat we do have is a strong squad and a good and brave coach. \nMan of the match: Ronaldo Vieira.

      "text": "Have your say \nRonaldo Vieira won the admiration of Bristol City manager Lee Johnson and admitted the threat of a fourth straight loss had driven Leeds United to one of their most convincing performances of the season in a 3-0 victory at Ashton Gate. \nThe 19-year-old was named in United‚Äôs starting line-up for the first time in a league game this term and contributed heavily to a rejuvenated display which stemmed the flow of defeats suffered by Thomas Christiansen‚Äôs side. Samuel Saiz celebrates scoring the opening goal against Bristol City. \nLeeds had dropped from first place in the Championship to sixth during a run of four losses in five games but climbed back up to fourth yesterday by ending Bristol City‚Äôs 12-match unbeaten run and inflicting their first home defeat. \nChristiansen responded to calls to strengthen his midfield by drafting in Vieira and allowing Kalvin Phillips to assume a more attacking role. Leeds scored twice in the first 15 minutes through a Samuel Saiz brace and sealed their win in the second half with a header from Pierre-Michel Lasogga. \nJohnson credited England Under-20 international Vieira for ‚Äúrunning the show‚Äù and Vieira said: ‚ÄúWe just knew we had to win the game. \n‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt go four games in a row losing if we wanted to be up there at the end of the season. All the boys worked hard during the week. Ronaldo Vieira battles in midfield against Bristol City. \n‚ÄúWe had a lot of meetings about Bristol and they‚Äôre a good team but I think we overlooked them and just tried to get the three points.‚Äù \nChristiansen came in for criticism for the first time since his appointment as head coach as an impressive start to the season faded either side of the recent international break but Vieira insisted the term was still in its infancy and said United‚Äôs players had not been suffering from excessive pressure. \n‚ÄúFrom the outside I felt it but from the inside, it‚Äôs still early,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll still be early until after Christmas. \n‚ÄúObviously the fans want to win and if we lose three games there‚Äôs a lot of pressure from the outside but on the inside everyone knew that we‚Äôve got time, we‚Äôre still up there and still had a chance. \n‚ÄúThere were only six points between four teams and you can get that in four days, Saturday to Tuesday. Everyone‚Äôs happy and hopefully we can carry it on.‚Äù \nVieira made a huge impact last season during his first year as a professional with Leeds, earning a maiden England youth cap and a new four-year contract as a result, but a combination of injury and Christiansen‚Äôs selection policy had denied him a start in any of United‚Äôs initial 12 league games. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm just pleased to be back out there enjoying myself and helping the team as much as I can,‚Äù Vieira said. \n‚ÄúI feel like I took my chance well but I came into the game just thinking ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to do as much as I can to help the team.‚Äô I thought I did well and we‚Äôll see what happens now.‚Äù Leeds United Nostalgia: Maverick midfielder Batty proved vital man for United Bristol City 0 Leeds United 3: Coach Christiansen dedicates weekend win at City to Dallas Sign in",

      "text": "Have your say \nThomas Christiansen has ordered his players to ignore Leicester City‚Äôs poor form and forget the idea that the Premier League club might be there for the taking when Leeds United bid to reach the Carabao Cup quarter-finals tomorrow. \nLeeds will be hosted by the former Premier League champions a week after Leicester reacted to a weak start to the season by sacking manager Craig Shakespeare. Leeds United head coach Thomas Christiansen. \nCity are under the caretaker control of assistant and former Oxford United boss Michael Appleton but a 2-1 win at Swansea City in Appleton‚Äôs first game in charge on Saturday lifted the club out of the top flight‚Äôs relegation places. \nLeicester have yet to decide on a permanent replacement for Shakespeare, who only replaced title winner Claudio Ranieri on a full-time basis in June, but United head coach Christiansen warned that this evening could be ‚Äúthe most dangerous time‚Äù to face a club who have experienced their share of turmoil since dramatically winning the Premier League in 2016. \nLeeds are attempting to scalp a top-flight side for the second time in the Carabao Cup having reached the last 16 by beating Burnley on penalties in the third round. \n‚ÄúLeicester had a good win this weekend, a win that can give them confidence back,‚Äù Christiansen said. Luke Ayling and Leeds United celebrate after beating Burnley on penalties in the third round of the Carabao Cup. \n‚ÄúYou never know when‚Äôs a good time (to play another club). When a team are hurt and they‚Äôre suffering down the table, that‚Äôs probably when it‚Äôs most dangerous to face them. You never know when is the right moment. \n‚ÄúWe faced Burnley when they were seventh in the league, playing well and getting important points and we managed to qualify for the next round. Anything can happen.‚Äù \nLeeds are looking for a second quarter-final appearance in two years having made the last eight of the League Cup under Garry Monk last season. United eventually suffered a narrow defeat to Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool at Anfield. \nAsked about the lure of moving closer to the latter stages and a possible future appearance at Wembley, Christiansen said: ‚ÄúThose are big words but I will try to win all of our games and I‚Äôll try to pass as many rounds as possible ‚Äì trying to do it in the best way for the team. \n‚ÄúWe also have to face the reality that we‚Äôve faced one Premier League team, we‚Äôre going to face another one and, if we have the luck to pass to the next round, we‚Äôll face another, perhaps a very strong Premier League team. \n‚ÄúWe just have to enjoy the moment and the game in front of us.‚Äù \nChristiansen‚Äôs squad stabilised their own league form after three successive defeats with an impressive 3-0 win at Bristol City on Saturday, the first of three matches in seven days. \nUnited, who are fourth in the Championship, contest a Yorkshire derby against third-placed Sheffield United on Friday but Christiansen denied that he would prioritise that fixture over the trip to Leicester, saying: ‚ÄúBoth are important. More than looking at both games, I will look at the players I have.‚Äù \nThe Leeds boss, however, was pleased with a result at Ashton Gate which repaired damaged confidence at Elland Road following a sudden drop in the from which took the club to the top of the Championship last month. \n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt lose (confidence) so fast and we don‚Äôt get it back so fast,‚Äù Christiansen said, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs the beginning of us recovering that confidence. It comes when the players see they do things right but I see and I believe that all the players are giving their best.‚Äù Video - Leeds United: Foxes cup tie gives Jansson chance to push for recall - Christiansen Leeds United team news: Grieving Dallas to miss Leicester City trip Sign in",

I must also mention Leo and Neymar, for being here,‚Äù Ronaldo said after recieving the prize. \n‚ÄúReal Madrid ‚Äì the coach, the supporters and the president ‚Äì they support all of the year so I say thank you to them. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm really glad to win consecutive awards. This is a great moment for me. Thank you to all the fans around the world for the support.

      "text": "Arsene Wenger to stick with rotation policy for Carabao Cup tie against Norwich Monday 23 October 2017 The Frenchman has never won the competition during his 21-year spell in charge of Arsenal. \nArsene Wenger will continue with the ‚Äòluxury‚Äô of rotating his Arsenal side and believes he has the squad depth to succeed while doing so. \nThe Gunners welcome Norwich to the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup. \nIt remains the one domestic trophy to elude Wenger during his time in England, with the Frenchman known for using the competition to blood young talent. \n‚Äî Carabao Cup (@Carabao_Cup) September 26, 2017 \nWenger √¢ who saw his side win 5-2 at Everton on Sunday in a result which saw Ronald Koeman lose his job as Toffees boss less than 24 hours later √¢ insists he will continue with the same approach, which he has also applied in the Europa League this season. \n√¢I will continue to rotate,√¢ he said. \n√¢I√¢ve gone into that rotation policy and afterwards you have to continue to do it, especially when both teams work well and both teams support each other at the moment. \n√¢I must say that it√¢s difficult to make a change because to win away from home in the way we did at Belgrade, you need some special quality. Let√¢s hope we can reiterate that against Norwich. \n‚Äî Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) October 23, 2017 \n√¢That√¢s the luxury I have at the moment and the difficulty I have as well. All these players do well, play well and they deserve to play. \n√¢Fortunately, we have important games every week, so I can give competition to everybody. As you said, we have so much offensive force on the bench as well. It√¢s really a strong point of the club at the moment.√¢ \nWenger came close to winning the League Cup in 2011 but his side were surprisingly beaten by Birmingham in the final. \n‚Äî Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) October 23, 2017 \nHe believes his current pool of players is strong enough to keep going in the Carabao Cup while offering the chance to give vital minutes to fringe players and youngsters. \n√¢I always used it to give a chance to young boys,√¢ he said when asked about never winning the League Cup. \n√¢We went to the final with a very young team and nearly won it. I always focus on winning trophies in the Premier League and FA Cup domestically, and always used the League Cup as an education for our young players. But with this team I have the squad to go further, so let√¢s see.√¢ ???? \"I love the cup competition‚Ä¶ I like do-or-die games.\" #ncfc pic.twitter.com/Plrhcfvzjo \n‚Äî Norwich City FC (@NorwichCityFC) October 23, 2017 \nWenger, who toasted his 68th birthday as his side saw off Everton, revealed he spent the rest of the day celebrating in the only way he wanted to √¢ by watching more football. \n√¢I didn√¢t really have a chance to celebrate,√¢ he added. \n√¢But most importantly, I enjoyed the day because we won and had a convincing result and played good football, and the team looked happy. \n√¢After that, last night there was a good French game, Marseille v Paris St Germain, which I could not miss! So in the end, I didn√¢t even go out for dinner because I planned to watch the game.√¢",

      "text": "Home / Opinion / Osun‚Äôs remarkable investment in mass education Osun‚Äôs remarkable investment in mass education ‚Äî 24th October 2017 \nBy Waheed Adekunle \nIT is evident that the present administration in Osun led by Governor Rauf Aregbesola has since inception committed largest chunks of the state‚Äôs resources to revamping the education sector as this is manifest in the achievements recorded so far. Reports have shown that the three senatorial districts of the state namely: Osun Central Senatorial District, Osun West Senatorial District and Osun East Senatorial District had in the last six and a half years witnessed a tremendous change and geometric progression not only in the education sector but in all aspects of human endeavours. The giant strides, however, did not stop at Senatorial Districts, but rather moved across the nine Federal Constituencies in the state. The Aregbesola administration‚Äôs resolve to take the bull by the horn in the education sector coupled with his genuine policy that gave masses, particularly the vulnerable, ample opportunities to access quality public education without hindrance had increased the soaring popularity of the state and as well made Osun a state to reckon with among its peers. The All Progressives Congress-led government in the state has, no doubt, showcased to the entire world that free education is not a lip service but a practical exercise that must reflect and manifest in the lives, of the masses particularly those whose income are low. The policy of ‚Äúevery child must go to school‚Äù initiated by the Aregbesola administration had not only rejuvenated the education sector but rekindled interest in public education, as education facilities being put in place outsmart those at the private schools. The initiative widens the scope of public school enrollment at a very impressive percentage and as well gives parents ultimate access to functional and quality public education for their children. It has also reflected in students‚Äô performances both in internal and external examinations since 2010. Moreover, it has been consistently reported that Osun‚Äôs education model had not only taken the centre point of the national education policy but contributed significantly to modern education systems and structures in the world. The impacts and imparts of Osun‚Äôs education policy which had been nationally and internationally adopted and replicated however made the state to be the first state in Nigeria to record such feat in the history of this country. Let‚Äôs take for instance, these efforts genuinely made by the present administration in Osun West Senatorial District as regards educational infrastructure and renaissance. Osun West Senatorial District has enjoyed a minimum of N11 billion (N10, 810,000,000.00) worth of investment in the education sector since 2010 till now. It is on record that six Model Elementary schools were built and commissioned with 150 classrooms across the Osun West Senatorial District while two of these schools were built in Iwo Local Government, one in Ayedaade Local Government, one in Ayedire Local Government and two in Ede South Local Government. In the same vein, nothing less than seven Model Middle schools were built and commissioned with 175 classrooms across Osun West Senatorial District. t One of these state-of-the-art schools was built in Irewole Local Government; one in Ejigbo Local Government, two in Iwo Local Government, two in Ayedaade Local Government and one in Irewole Local Government. Also, four Model High Schools were built and commissioned across the Osun West Senatorial District where one of these model schools was built in Ejigbo Local Government, one in Ede South Local Government, one in Iwo Local Government and one in Irewole. Likewise, more than 600 classrooms across 100 models schools were renovated in conjunction with UBEB: 2,094 sets of of furniture supplied to the schools across the ten LGAs that make up Osun West Senatorial District. Also, about 20 scholar buses and 50 personnel deployed to the Senatorial District and more than 50,000 students have benefited from the Opon-Imo project in three years. It is also on record that over 2,000 OYES cadets from Osun West Senatorial District were deployed to different schools as teachers just as about 1, 076 regular teachers were recruited from the same zone while 900 teachers were trained in 26 different training programmes and workshops. In addition, more than 6,000 teaching and non-teaching staff were promoted from Osun West Senatorial District while more than 84,000 pupils get fed daily under school feeding programmes for which 1,000 cooks were employed all from the Senatorial District. The statistics show that ‚Äéabout 68 million delicious meals have been served since 2012 across 500 schools in the Osun West Senatorial District, while 300,000 school uniforms were distributed free to students across the 10 LGAs of the Senatorial District. The government‚Äôs achievements in the state of Osun are not only limited to the West Senatorial District. they are visible all overthe state. However, for lack of time and space. \nAdekunle writes from Osogbo. Your email address will not be published.

      "text": "Chelsea v Everton   25th October 2017 24th October 2017 / lee Chelsea v Everton EFL Cup, 25th October 7.45pm \nThe Toffees go to Stamford Bridge for their first game since the sacking of Ronald Koeman. Their poor season continued on the weekend with a home drubbing coming at the hands of Arsenal. Chelsea showed a bit of character on the weekend to fight back at home from behind to beat Watford. The Blues are 4/9 odds on at William Hill to win , with the draw at 15/4 and Everton at a big 7/1 price. Chelsea v Everton   \nLate goals at the Bridge on the weekend saw Chelsea come from behind against Watford to land a win. But could have been a very different story if the Hornets hadn‚Äôt been so wasteful in front of goal. Still, Chelsea‚Äôs spirits will have been boosted by that win, which is their only victory in their last four in all competitions now. They haven‚Äôt looked great at the back but both teams NOT to score at William Hill looks some value at 19/20. The Blues have won their last three games against Everton without conceding and have taken four clean sheets in their last five games against the Toffees at Stamford Bridge. One of those was a 2-0 win that Chelsea put up in this season‚Äôs Premier League over the Toffees back at the end of August with goals from Cesc Fabregas and Alvaro Morata. A Chelsea 2-0 correct score is a 6/1 punt at William Hill, with the 1-0 victory for them at the same price. You will have the coverage of a Chelsea to win to nil at 7/5 with William Hill . Michy Batshuayi looks to have a great scoring touch at the moment and he is 8/11 in the anytime goalscorer market. \nEverton haven‚Äôt won any of their last six games out on the road this season and they have now lost three of their last four road games (D1) in all competitions this season, failing to score in three of those as well. The Toffees gave Ronald Koeman the boot after a 5-2 hammering at Goodison Park against Arsenal on the weekend and they are looking shaky at the back and a bit clueless going forward. Wayne Rooney is their shortest priced anytime goalscorer option at 3/1. The Toffees have conceded at least two goals now each of their last three games against the Blues and can‚Äôt be trusted in this one. In the last round of the League Cup they took a 3-0 home win over Sunderland and that is just one of two wins in their last thirteen games across all conditions now (D4 L7). They have a lot of work to do and they have taken just the one clean sheet in their last thirteen games. Who will win ‚Äì Chelsea v Everton EFL Cup Predictions \nChelsea to win: A change of manager won‚Äôt necessarily change the fortunes of Everton overnight at all. Chelsea showed decent character on the weekend and while their back line looks shaky, Everton don‚Äôt have the attacking threat to hurt it enough.

      "text": "Turning points, most of the time, become evident only in hindsight. Nobody who saw Chelsea‚Äôs 3-0 defeat at Arsenal early last season would have suspected that a simple half-time tactical switch ‚Äì from four at the back to three ‚Äì would be the catalyst that drove Antonio Conte‚Äôs side to the title. And after an hour of Chelsea‚Äôs game on Saturday, with the home side 2-1 down and Watford rampant, very few would have suspected that Chelsea‚Äôs fortunes were about to take a turn for the better.\nWatford were carving Chelsea open at will. Richarlison had missed two glorious chances that would have put Watford 4-1 up. Chelsea‚Äôs players were bawling at each other like schoolchildren. The mood in the stands was not quite mutiny, more a sort of blind, high-pitched panic. Conte, normally so animated and demonstrative, simply paced up and down his technical area a little sadly: not waving, and not far from drowning.\nThe dam, it felt, was about to burst. ‚ÄúWhen you see your team suffering,‚Äù Conte explained afterwards, ‚Äúit is not simple. But you must be cold to try to find the right way to help your team.‚Äù\nBut this is not 2015-16, Conte is not Jose Mourinho, and the dam did not burst. Conte was cold. He took off the underperforming Marcos Alonso, brought on Michy Batshuayi and Willian, and was rewarded with three late goals . Chelsea took Watford‚Äôs fourth place in the table and kept up the pressure on the Manchester clubs and Tottenham. Crisis averted.\nFor now, at any rate. ‚ÄúThe performance was not great, no sugar-coating that,‚Äù admitted Gary Cahill. ‚ÄúBut the three points was all that mattered. Onto the next one, and build a bit of momentum that way. When you get a few back-to-back wins, you will see how everything lifts.‚Äù\nAnd yet it is hard to see Chelsea going on that winning run unless without addressing some of their underlying issues. Seven goals conceded in a week - following the 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace and the 3-3 draw with Roma - is not exactly the stuff of champions, for instance. Too many of their players are not playing at their peak. Cahill, arguably, is one of them. Cesar Azpilicueta is another. Cesc Fabregas and Tiemoue Bakayoko are still one Kante short of a solid midfield. Chelsea are badly in need of some of the back-to-basics defensive drilling that so dramatically turned their season around a year ago, but with the Champions League packing their schedule, it is hard to see where the time for that will come from. ‚ÄúWe are not on the training pitch as much because of that,‚Äù Cahill admitted. ‚ÄúLast season, naturally you feel fresh going into games. But you can‚Äôt say you can‚Äôt win the league because of that. We won the league two years ago playing Champions League football. So it is what it is.‚Äù\nCahill did, however, proffer an explanation for Chelsea‚Äôs uncharacteristically leaky defence. ‚ÄúAgainst Roma I felt the work-rate was there, but the intensity was slightly off,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLast year we were closing down all the way and rushing decisions from opponents. Collectively, we were doing things better last season. The shape worked so well because everyone has to do their job.‚Äù\nRead between the lines, therefore, and we can surmise that Cahill does not think everybody is doing their job this season. And this perhaps speaks to the other, less quantifiable issue with this Chelsea squad at the moment: its emotional fragility. As Watford started to take the initiative on Saturday, you could see fingers being pointed, blame being apportioned, decisions being questioned.\nIt is hard not to conclude, therefore, that this is not a club that is currently united behind a common vision. Conte‚Äôs ongoing skirmish with the board over recruitment is just one manifestation of that. Brittleness behind the scenes translates into brittleness on the pitch, in turn lowering the mood still further.\n‚ÄúI would guess it‚Äôs the same at every other big club,‚Äù Cahill said. ‚ÄúWhen things are going well, everyone‚Äôs coming into training, having a lot of banter and joking about. When you are not, it‚Äôs not that feeling, because the expectation level is to win. That‚Äôs natural.‚Äù\nChelsea play Everton next in the Carabao Cup, which Conte said would be an opportunity for young players like Charly Musonda and Kenedy to stake a claim. Following that, Bournemouth away, the return fixture against Roma, and then a reunion with Mourinho‚Äôs United at Stamford Bridge. At the end of that run, we should have a much clearer idea of whether this Chelsea side is equipped to challenge for the big prizes. The quality is certainly there, and their comeback on Saturday showed the spirit is still there. Yet so much else feels wrong. Chelsea remain title challengers, just about. But it is a title challenge being held together with paperclips and string.",

Plenty wanted a change. \nStill, the feeling generally was that it was unlikely ‚Äì for now at least. \nAnd then at 1.30pm, came the four-line statement that would change everything. \n‚ÄúEverton Football Club can confirm that Ronald Koeman has left the club,‚Äù it read. \n‚ÄúChairman Bill Kenwright, the board of directors and major shareholder Farhad Moshiri would all like to express their gratitude to Ronald for the service he has given to the club over the past 16 months and for guiding the club to seventh place in last season‚Äôs Premier League campaign.‚Äù \nHe'd gone. Koeman - in his own words \nEarlier in the day Dutch journalist, and Koeman confidante, Marcel van der Kraan had told Sky Sports News that Koeman still felt he had the backing of both Kenwright and Moshiri; he didn't, he said, feel ‚Äúfinished‚Äù. \nHis faith was swiftly proven misplaced. He leaves Everton in the bottom three of the Premier League, having overseen their worst start to a season in a dozen years. They're struggling for goals at one end, and leaking them alarmingly at the other. \nHe will be followed out of the door by his brother Erwin, his first-team coach, as well as fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg and goalkeeping coach Patrick Lodewijks. \nDavid Unsworth and John Ebbrell, Everton's U23s coaches, will take charge of the first-team as they prepare for Wednesday's Carabao Cup trip to Chelsea. Unsworth could be given longer than his last interim spell, which was just one game, as the Blues consider their options in terms of a long-term successor. Read More",

Close Jose Mourinho rips into Manchester United players after shock Huddersfield defeat Hayters \nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville has described the Red Devils' 2-1 defeat to Huddersfield on 21 October as \"a big shock\". \nErrors from Juan Mata and Victor Lindelof led to the Terriers establishing a 2-0 lead in the first half at the John Smith's Stadium, with Marcus Rashford scoring a late consolation goal for the visitors. \nThe defeat was United's first in the Premier League this season, with manager Jose Mourinho saying in the post-match interview that the attitude of his players at newly-promoted Huddersfield was worse than in a friendly match. \nNeville said he did not expect his former club to stumble at the John Smith's Stadium, given their impressive start to the season, and went on to say that he was \"stunned\" by Mourinho's comments. \n\"I thought it would be tough for United because of the atmosphere but I also thought they'd come through it. I was stunned by the result,\" the former England defender told Sky Sports . \n\"I was stunned also by Jose Mourinho's comments afterwards about the application of the players, saying it was the worst he's seen them up for the game. \n\"It was a big shock and bad goals to concede. Lindelof made a couple of poor mistakes. I think if the other team does something brilliant, you can recover from it but you don't give yourself a chance if you're making poor mistakes. Jose Mourinho admitted Huddersfield deserved to beat his Manchester United team at the John Smith's Stadium Getty Images \n\"When your goalkeeper, defenders are making poor mistakes, the anxiety runs not only into the team but into the crowd.\" \nUnited's defeat allowed Tottenham to move level on points with them in second place heading into the pair's Premier League clash at Old Trafford on 28 October. \nSpurs are in high spirits after securing a 1-1 draw at Real Madrid in the Champions League and following it up with a 4-1 thrashing of Liverpool at Wembley over the weekend. \n\"Saturday is now a huge game for United to get back on their bike after falling off,\" Neville added. \"They're playing against a Tottenham side with great confidence. \n\"If Tottenham play anything like they did [against Liverpool], Manchester United will have to be at their best ‚Äì they can't be below.\" More from IBTimes UK Sport",

Neymar and Messi played together for four seasons (Image: Getty Images Europe) Lionel Messi and wife Antonella Roccuzzo arrive (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nThe votes from the manager and captain of each national team nominates were revealed. A media representative from each country was given the same opportunity. \nArgentina captain Messi voted for Luis Suarez (first), Andres Iniesta (second) and Neymar (third). The shortlist for the top men's player of the year was Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nEngland captain Jordan Henderson voted for Ronaldo then Messi and then former team-mate Suarez. Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate, meanwhile, opted for Ronaldo, Modric and Toni Kroos. \nWales captain Ashley Williams did not take part in the vote. His manager Chris Coleman did, however. He picked Ramos, Modric and Harry Kane. \nTottenham striker Kane also picked up nominations from British Virgin Islands captain Troy Ceasar Kavon, France skipper Hugo Lloris, Motserrat's Anthony Griffith and Dio Godet of the Bahamas. \nOther Premier League players to pick up nominations include Alexis Sanchez, N'Golo Kante, Eden Hazard and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

That shortlist was reached, the organization said in a statemement, with input from national team coaches, national team captains, media representatives and fans. \n\"If some random male player, who was not even a full professional, was nominated, I'm sure {FIFA) would step in for that, so it's disappointing that the same hasn't been done for us,\" Rapinoe said, in response. \nBy comparison, the players on the shortlist for the men's 2017 award are Barcelona's Lionel Messi, Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and Paris Saint-Germain's Neymar. \nCastellanos, a striker who plays collegiately at Florida State and for a California pro-am side, has never represented Venezuela at the senior or even U-20 level. \nMeantime, players such as Australia forward Sam Kerr, who became the all-time leading scorer in the National Women's Soccer League in the U.S., and England striker Jodie Taylor, who was the top scorer at Euro 2017, were left off. \nKerr's reaction to the snub: \"Not surprised really; it's FIFA\" Article continues below \nRapinoe ‚Äî who won Olympic gold with the U.S. in 2012 and the World Cup in 2015 and has 127 caps ‚Äî says the shortlist smacks of an organization that is \"old, male and stale.\" \n\"It signals to us and it signals to the rest of the world that FIFA doesn't really care,\" she said. \nFIFA will hand out its awards Monday in London.",

      "text": "Blog , CXM News \nIt is high time B2B companies finally embraced what B2C companies have known for years. \nIn 2009, when I was running usability research for Skype‚Äôs business proposition, I noticed that business customers were starting to ask questions like: ‚ÄúIf the websites and platforms I use in my personal life are slick and easy to use, why do I have to struggle so much in my work life?‚Äù \nThat was eight years ago. Unfortunately the question has still not gone away as most B2B organisations still assume that their customers will put up with whatever solution is provided for them. \nWith the ever-present and easily accessible SaaS platforms now disrupting a number of industries, ignoring business tools provided by your company is no longer an option. Neither is ignoring the fact that even though you are selling to other businesses, you are still selling to people. \nDuring a recent workshop I gave to a group of Finnish marketing specialists , I found it interesting how many of the B2B marketers struggled to identify their customer or even think of the other company as a customer. \nI‚Äôll admit that a whole company can be tricky to view as a customer but there will be a key decision-maker in any client organisation. Understanding why this customer buys from your company will be crucial to ensuring your organisation‚Äôs success. \nThe UK is leading the way when it comes to customer focus so the Finnish example may be extreme, but that does not mean that we have it all sorted when it comes to B2B experiences. \nHere‚Äôs a few of key points about customer expectations in the B2C sector: There is a proliferation of products and services out there so loyalty to one is no longer guaranteed Customers are moving away from valuing things and focusing more on experiences Ethics and company values (and therefore brands) play a huge role in purchasing decisions \nThese attitudes will not stay within the B2C space so let‚Äôs examine what that means in a business context: With the rise of SaaS platforms, it is easier than ever to build a sophisticated business with very little technical knowledge and a relatively small financial outlay. This means that almost every traditional industry is under threat from disruption. The key way for established businesses to ‚Äúwin‚Äù in this marketplace is to leverage the quality of their offering and their experience. Through years of corporate responsibility efforts, most larger companies will already hold ethical values and carry out positive impact projects but very few use this to their advantage. There are also only a handful of B2B organisations that have become household names, partly because of the limitations of the brand positioning and amplification efforts. \nUnless B2B organisations are willing to accept lower margins and compete on cost, the only option here is to innovate through service provision, taking a leaf from the books of AirBnB and Uber but not aiming to do the same. \nAnd there is plenty of fertile ground to cover when it comes to service provision. Recent McKinsey research shows that most B2B customers need very little support for repeat purchases and struggle with slow response times across tasks, leading them to look for alternative suppliers. \nThese kinds of issues have been ironed out within the B2C sector, so even achieving parity with the consumer-facing organisations would be a huge step forward, allowing the B2B industry to focus on what they are really good at, instead of spending time troubleshooting client issues.

      "text": "Fluorescent tags and Nanoparticles compared as biological imaging tools using Prior stage Prior Scientific, Inc. Favorites QUESTION A Prior stage has been used in a ground-breaking study comparing traditional fluorescent tags to Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Nanoparticles (SERS NPs), which found there were significant differences between the two imaging methods. \nPRIOR SCIENTIFIC‚ÄôS H117 MOTORIZED PRECISION STAGE was used in a study comparing the characteristics of traditional fluorescent \nprobes with SERS NPs, in which the two methods were used to fluorescently image both live and fixed cells. Interest in using \nSERS NPs rather than traditional fluorescent tags in biological imaging is growing, due to the nanoparticles‚Äô stability and the \nnarrow spectral features that they display. Maria Navas-Moreno and colleagues at the University of California Davis Centre for \nBiophotonics compared fluorescent probes and SERS NPs, showing that the two methods produced similar results in fixed cells, \nbut dramatically different patterns when used on live cells. This research, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrates that \nunexpected cellular interactions with nanoparticles must be taken into account, before using SERS as an alternative to traditional \nprobes. A home build Raman microscopy system, incorporating an H117 stage, was a key part of this system. Especially \nimportant from Maria‚Äôs view was that the H117‚Äôs large travel range (114 x 75 mm) ensured that a large field of view was easy to \nimage. Manuj Patel, Global Strategic Marketing Manager for Prior Scientific, says: \n‚ÄúThe H117 stage is frequently the stage of choice for live cell imaging, as it offers a combination of speed, easy integration into \nnumerous imaging packages via the ProScan III control system, and precision positioning, with a repeatability of just 0.2 um, and a \nmetric accuracy of 0.059 um/mm. I‚Äôm very grateful to Maria and her colleagues for sharing their interesting research with us, as well \nas providing such positive feedback on our products.‚Äù \nA longer description of this application is available via Prior Scientific; to find out more about this research or Prior‚Äôs range of \nprecision products for microscopy, please email jwilson@prior.com or visit www.prior.com.

The residential sector generated most of the demand for furniture products in the country. The government of Philippines aims to be the global design hub for furniture products using sustainable materials by 2030. Through the efforts of the Chamber of Furniture Industries in the Philippines (CFIP) and the Cebu Furniture Industries Foundation (CFIF), the industry expects to make a global mark through the sustainable production of sophisticated, sturdy and environmentally friendly products. \nThe Board of Investments (BOI) of Philippines agreed to provide incentive of PHP 9.13 million furniture export project in Mandaue City, which is expected to boost the country's positioning as a global hub for furniture. The project, under Maison Galuchat Inc, is expected to manufacture furniture and accessories and export all of them to countries in Asia , Europe and the US. The company intends to initially employ about 50 craftsmen and gradually expand it to 120 by 2022. \nMiddle class households in the country accounted for approximately 45.0% of overall population of the country and accounted for approximately 66.0% of the country's household income in 2016. The construction of more condominiums and residential houses in the country is expected to drive the growth of the industry in the coming years. The property sector's strong growth and families' easier access to housing credit will also increase demand for household items and furniture products in the near future. The diversification of furniture is also marked by the shift from the production of low-end furniture to the medium and high-end lines. This means emphasis on quality, design and material rather than on mass production of pieces. This is attributed primarily to growing competition globally. \nIt has been observed that Furniture manufacturing in Philippines is limited to clusters in Metro Manila, Pampanga and Cebu, while most of the retail sales are still restricted to the regions in Cebu, Davao and Quezon. There are multiple regions that are yet to be catered and tapped by the organized furniture market players operating in Philippines . \nKen Research in its latest study, \" Philippines Furniture Market by Type (Home - Bed Room, Living Room, Dining Room, Kitchen Furniture; Office; Hotel & Industrial), by Sales (Domestic and Export) - Outlook to 2021 \" suggests that the increasing demand for bedroom furniture by the growing residential sector in Philippines is projected to be the highest revenue generating segment in the home furniture market. The anticipated rise in number of housing units and middle class population will drive the sales of bed frames, wardrobes, dressing table and other furniture, which are a part of bedroom set. Rise in number of online market players catering to the demand for wooden products and accessories are also estimated to stimulate the market revenues in a positive manner. \nThe report provides information on market size of the Philippines Furniture market, market segmentation on the basis of Organized and Unorganized market, end users and by cities which is sub categorized into home furniture market segmentation. \nKey Data Points Covered in the Report: Philippine Furniture Market Size Furniture Market by Organized and Unorganized Sectors Furniture Market End Users Philippines Furniture Market Cities in Philippines Philippines Home Furniture Market Segmentation Business and Working Model in Philippines Furniture Market Export and Import in Philippines Furniture Market Market Share of Major Players in Philippines Furniture Market Regulatory Scenario in Philippines Furniture Market Mattress market revenue and outlook Online furniture market analysis Kids Furniture Market Size Philippines Bed Room Furniture Market Philippines Bed Market Sales Philippines",

      "text": "Found buys youth marketing agency Disrupt October 23, 2017 \nDigital performance pioneer Found has acquired youth marketing agency Disrupt, combining each firm‚Äôs data analytics, social content and performance marketing. \nDisrupt was started by entrepreneurs Matt Thorne and Phil Kemish who met whilst working together with publishers and brands to create native content for culture-savvy audiences. \nThe agency has pioneered branded stories in the UK urban scene for such brands as AG BARR, Absolut, Thomas Cook‚Äôs Club 18-30, and House of Marley. \nPhil Kemish, co-Founder of Disrupt, says: ‚ÄúWe are really excited to join forces with Found. From the moment we met Tina and the team we could see that they were our type of people: creative, passionate, focused and, above all, we have a shared vision to create a digital agency for the future. By joining our entrepreneurial spirit, experience and talented people together, we believe we will be able to take what we‚Äôve developed and super-charge it at scale to help our clients innovate and succeed in the rapidly changing disruptive digital era.‚Äù \nTina Judic, CEO of Found, says: ‚ÄúFrom the moment I met the Disrupt team, I was hooked. We‚Äôre now faced with an exciting new digital world led by the most connected generation of digital users. Disrupt operates in the thick of these users‚Äô lifestyles, creating experiences and content that connects, entertains and enriches their lives. It is a company that has earned itself an enviable reputation for making brands famous at the cutting edge of culture.‚Äù \n‚ÄúBringing together Disrupt‚Äôs brilliant understanding of how to successfully manipulate the social space with Found‚Äôs own passion for remastering ROI represents a major step change in how we can now elevate the way brands connect with their customers. It provides the industry with an exciting proposition for expanding the way businesses successfully market to these influential digital users to now help all brands to think more disruptively.‚Äù \nMatt Thorne, co-Founder of Disrupt, says: ‚ÄúWe believe the future of marketing lies in the ability to understand and measure content and engagement. We strive to go deeper and beyond the vanity metrics to really create brand fame. Together with Found, we have a real opportunity to solidify this approach and break the barriers of ROI for our clients, enabling us to offer truly exciting and measureable content on digital channels that has real impact and authenticity to the audiences.‚Äù \nThe Disrupt team will now relocate to Google Premier Partner Award winner Found‚Äôs Smithfield headquarters and will slot neatly into Found‚Äôs Web of Moments philosophy ‚Äì the principle of there being an ever-shifting plane of touchpoints between brands and customers where strategies can be honed to reach, attract, influence, engage or convert at any relevant point in time. \nTina adds: ‚ÄúFound‚Äôs ability to analyse and break the digital world down into a Web of Moments means brands can now successfully accompany their customers in these moments, whatever the channel, whatever the device. Disrupt not only understands the critical reach social marketing has, but also the depth and style of content audiences demand if they‚Äôre going to engage with a brand. Fusing these two approaches together will allow us to not just connect brands through clever data insight but also provide our clients with a much deeper understanding of the physicality of audience engagement.‚Äù",

Flipkart in India October 23, 2017 \nAmazon‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Great Indian Festival‚Äô generated more transacting customers than any other online platform during the festive Diwali season in India, including market leader Flipkart, according to new research. \nThe IMRB study also indicates that the Amazon India site had the highest number of customers as well as the maximum number of orders placed through the festive season. Amazon‚Äôs Prime membership too saw a 4x increase in customer sign-ups. \nContrasting data from Flipkart \nHowever, rival ecommerce giant Flipkart highlighted a report from market watcher RedSeer Management Consulting that claims the firm had been able to capture almost 58% of the market share during the first five days of the sale period, which stood at Rs 9,000 crore. \nSmrithi Ravichandran, senior director at Flipkart, said:‚ÄúWe have made the competition irrelevant and have surpassed them on every count. In a lot of categories where we were the underdogs going in, we believe that we have beaten them.‚Äù \nFlipkart claimed that it was able to grow sales in every major category on its platform ‚Äî smartphones by five times, large appliances by 10 times, fashion and home by four times and electronics by seven times, compared to sales during 30 days in a non-sale period. \nAmazon‚Äôs biggest sales in India yet \nAmazon India Senior Vice-President and Country Head Amit Agarwal claimed this year‚Äôs festive sales to be the biggest yet and said that the online marketplace giant is the undisputed leader. \n‚ÄúWe are humbled by the tremendous response from customers making Amazon.in the undisputed leader in the e-commerce industry with the most number of transacting customers and order share. More customers shopped on Amazon.in than anywhere else with orders received from 99.7% of India‚Äôs pin codes. Customers shopped across mobile phones, TVs, large appliances, home d√©cor, furniture, sports equipment and everyday essentials, making the Great Indian Festival the biggest shopping event for Amazon.in in history,‚Äù said Agarwal. \nThe company also witnessed a surge of 86 per cent in the number of new customers from smaller towns. Its loyalty programme Prime continued to be a bestseller during the festival, with membership doubling since July 2017. \nIndia accounted for the highest number of Prime members in a debut year, growing the fastest among the 13 countries where Amazon Prime is available. \n‚ÄúCustomers voted for Amazon Pay as a trusted and convenient way to pay and we saw more new customers this festive season top up their balances than ever before. More customers chose to use Amazon Pay to pay for their orders. There was a 34x increase in the number of top-ups,‚Äù the company said. \nKantar IMRB‚Äôs empaneled survey of 32,000 online consumers in over 200 cities.",

      "text": "AAB‚Äôs outsourcing division grows 25% in 2017   Anderson Anderson & Brown LLP (AAB), one of the leading independent firms of Chartered Accountants and Business Advisors in Scotland, has announced that fee income within its outsourcing division has grown by 25% in the last 12 months, driven by 50 new clients coming on board throughout the UK. This new business gained has resulted in 5 new posts being created in this division alone, as well as giving rise to 5 promotions within the team. Whilst over half of AAB‚Äôs outsourcing clients are still UK headquartered an increasing number of international businesses coming to the UK are now working in partnership with AAB, with many of these businesses being internationally owned or managed from overseas, in a host of countries including Norway, Italy, USA, UAE, Italy, Mexico, Australia and Russia. Through AAB‚Äôs cloud based outsourcing solutions, businesses can be transformed by a service which takes care of all accounting, bookkeeping, UK and international tax, VAT, global payroll, project management and data capture requirements. The growth achieved in this area has been as a result of both client and market demand for cloud-based services which offer businesses the opportunity to gain real-time information on their key business areas, from anywhere in the world, at any time. Steve Mitchell, Partner and Head of Outsourcing at AAB commented ‚ÄúTechnology truly has made the world a smaller place and because of cloud-based software systems, users can access real-time data from any location, globally, at any time, as long as they have access to the internet, meaning that they constantly have an up-to-date view of their business finances available at their fingertips. We are delighted with the significant growth in our outsourcing business in the last year and are now working with a fantastic range of clients across a broad range of sectors and geographical locations. We are very much focussed on working in partnership with our clients to deliver them the best outsourcing solution to add value to their business .‚Äù",

      "text": "ISE 2018 \nAVIXA, formerly InfoComm, will overhaul its membership structure in an effort to offer more flexibility to meet the varying needs of its members. The changes are part of the organisation‚Äôs three-year strategic plan and are designed to accommodate needs of members in different countries and the diverse range of businesses that might consider joining the AV community. Three levels of membership will now be on offer providing services such as free access to shows, eligibility for council membership, access to standards, and discounts on education. The top-tier individual membership will provide unlimited access to AVIXA's online training. Companies can join as enterprise members, with three levels to choose from, plus an option to create a custom enterprise membership. Depending on the level of enterprise membership, companies will have access benefits such as online training for their employees, contract training, discounts on market research, and exhibition space at trade shows. The different levels include varying numbers of individual memberships that can be distributed to employees. Betsy Jaffe, senior vice president of member services at AVIXA, said: \"AVIXA provides a community for AV service providers, live events professionals, manufacturers, and technology managers to come together to move the industry forward. ‚ÄúIt's the association's mission to provide the resources needed for AV professionals to thrive.

He will identify how the right training and leadership skills will help to meet those challenges and make the most of the opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. \nLewin‚Äôs keynote will cover: The skills shortage and upskilling for the future. Challenges when implementing change within an organisation. The leadership skills required for change. The importance of communication and employee engagement in the implementation of Industry 4.0. \nLewin commented: ‚ÄúWe used to say that at least change was constant. Now it feels like even change itself is changing. The amount of activity, the frequency of projects and the requirement to adapt quickly is ever-increasing. The nature of change is shifting with new technology and Industry 4.0 becoming a reality. \n‚ÄúThis raises a lot of questions. What does Industry 4.0 bring in terms of skills and management? How will companies find the right people to work with Industry 4.0 technology? And what skills will be required to effectively implement such a new way of working? My keynote will address some of these important issues.‚Äù \nOther high profile speakers at the conference include Trevor Stacey, Operations Director for Coca Cola European Partners and Jon Evans, Head of Operations at BAE Systems.",

      "text": "Differences in procurement maturity growing globally 15 April 2015 Consultancy.uk Elixirr's Ellie Duffus on building a challenger consultancy brand Companies in the utilities sector have the highest maturity level in the area of procurement. Organisations in mining, wholesale and ICT come in on second place, reveals a recent research by Supply Value. Across the board, the differences in procurement maturity are on the rise. Every year Supply Value, a supply chain consulting firm , conducts research into the trends and developments within the field of procurement. For the 2015 edition, Supply Value teamed up with IFPSM and ISM*, and surveyed more than 550 procurement professionals from 20 countries operating across various branches. Around half of the respondents work in companies with more than 500 FTE. Procurement maturity One of the themes investigated through the research is the procurement maturity of organisations. For this the researchers used the procurement development model created by Keough**. The model has five levels of achievement, dependent on the level of maturity, from humble beginnings (‚ÄòServe the Factory‚Äô; score 1) to masters of maturity (‚ÄòWorld-class Supply Management‚Äô; score 5). ‚ÄúThe further an organisation develops within the procurement maturity model, the more mature the purchase-function and processes become, the more partnerships the company enters into, the more supplier performance measurements and improvements to best practice are made, and how the more integral values in the value chain improves‚Äù, explains Ramon Abbenhuis, consultant at Supply Value and co-author of the report. Out of the data significant differences in maturity between sectors are disclosed. For instance, organisations in construction and retail scored under 2.7, considerably lower than the leaders, that are particularly active in the utilities, wholesale and ICT sectors. ‚ÄúThese are the sectors professionally engaged in procurement-, contract- and supplier management.‚Äù With a score of 2.3 businesses in construction, forestry, fisheries are the lowest scorers in the area of procurement. Not entirely surprising, according to Abbenhuis, ‚Äúprocurement traditionally plays a smaller role in the business practice of these sectors. However, they typically still have a relatively large amount of low hanging fruit in the area of purchase and contract management.‚Äù Growing differences From the full dataset it can be concluded that the difference between leaders and laggers is on the increase. Where last year merely 4% of companies made it into the ‚ÄúWorld-class Supply Management‚Äù category, this year it has risen to 10%. With increases in the level 4 category also occurring from the previous years‚Äô result. At the same time however, a similar trend can be seen at the lowest level, with as consequence that businesses have been driven out of the middle category ‚Äúcoordinated purchasing‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe first trend, in which companies move into the highest maturity levels, can be explained by the fact that more and more companies are professionally active in procurement, contract and supplier management. This is no longer something only done by large businesses in each of the sectors. We are anxious to observe if the trend will continue in the next edition of the research.‚Äù * IFPSM = The International Federation of Purchasing and Supply Management. The platform unites more than 40 national and regional purchasing associations worldwide, who have around 200,000 purchasing professionals as members. ISM¬Æ= Institute for Supply Management¬Æ. ISM is the first supply management institute in the world, with over 46,000 supply chain professionals as members, ISM advances the practice of supply management to drive value and competitive advantage, and contribute to a prosperous, sustainable world. ** The procurement development model from Keough: News",

      "text": "Blog , CXM News \nIt is high time B2B companies finally embraced what B2C companies have known for years. \nIn 2009, when I was running usability research for Skype‚Äôs business proposition, I noticed that business customers were starting to ask questions like: ‚ÄúIf the websites and platforms I use in my personal life are slick and easy to use, why do I have to struggle so much in my work life?‚Äù \nThat was eight years ago. Unfortunately the question has still not gone away as most B2B organisations still assume that their customers will put up with whatever solution is provided for them. \nWith the ever-present and easily accessible SaaS platforms now disrupting a number of industries, ignoring business tools provided by your company is no longer an option. Neither is ignoring the fact that even though you are selling to other businesses, you are still selling to people. \nDuring a recent workshop I gave to a group of Finnish marketing specialists , I found it interesting how many of the B2B marketers struggled to identify their customer or even think of the other company as a customer. \nI‚Äôll admit that a whole company can be tricky to view as a customer but there will be a key decision-maker in any client organisation. Understanding why this customer buys from your company will be crucial to ensuring your organisation‚Äôs success. \nThe UK is leading the way when it comes to customer focus so the Finnish example may be extreme, but that does not mean that we have it all sorted when it comes to B2B experiences. \nHere‚Äôs a few of key points about customer expectations in the B2C sector: There is a proliferation of products and services out there so loyalty to one is no longer guaranteed Customers are moving away from valuing things and focusing more on experiences Ethics and company values (and therefore brands) play a huge role in purchasing decisions \nThese attitudes will not stay within the B2C space so let‚Äôs examine what that means in a business context: With the rise of SaaS platforms, it is easier than ever to build a sophisticated business with very little technical knowledge and a relatively small financial outlay. This means that almost every traditional industry is under threat from disruption. The key way for established businesses to ‚Äúwin‚Äù in this marketplace is to leverage the quality of their offering and their experience. Through years of corporate responsibility efforts, most larger companies will already hold ethical values and carry out positive impact projects but very few use this to their advantage. There are also only a handful of B2B organisations that have become household names, partly because of the limitations of the brand positioning and amplification efforts. \nUnless B2B organisations are willing to accept lower margins and compete on cost, the only option here is to innovate through service provision, taking a leaf from the books of AirBnB and Uber but not aiming to do the same. \nAnd there is plenty of fertile ground to cover when it comes to service provision. Recent McKinsey research shows that most B2B customers need very little support for repeat purchases and struggle with slow response times across tasks, leading them to look for alternative suppliers. \nThese kinds of issues have been ironed out within the B2C sector, so even achieving parity with the consumer-facing organisations would be a huge step forward, allowing the B2B industry to focus on what they are really good at, instead of spending time troubleshooting client issues.

      "text": "REHAU Automotive to deploy Siemens software exclusively across all 15 plants Tue, Oct 24, 2017 08:00 CET Automotive supplier standardizes on Siemens portfolio to replace legacy systems Integrated solution to enable digitalization of engineering and manufacturing Worldwide rollout to begin drive toward Industry 4.0 \nREHAU Automotive, German automotive supplier and polymer specialist, will exclusively deploy Siemens software products to replace several legacy systems in engineering, manufacturing and quality management. With this decision REHAU becomes one of the first automotive suppliers to implement a company-wide manufacturing execution system (MES) and quality management system (QMS) integrated into a product lifecycle management (PLM) system for product and process digitalization and closed loop manufacturing. REHAU will replace all of its legacy software systems in 15 plants worldwide with the full scope of Siemens‚Äô Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) portfolio in order to maintain a competitive edge for the on-coming fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0. \n‚ÄúThis is the lighthouse project for REHAU Automotive and is unique in our company‚Äôs history,‚Äù said Helmut Ansorge, member of the REHAU Automotive executive board. ‚ÄúOver the last decade, we developed homegrown, individual solutions for every site. As time went on, the complexity of these legacy systems made it difficult for us to keep growing and maintain our competitive edge. This new integrated software system will give us the ability to standardize all processes and logistics in a lean way in order to develop and deliver the highest quality products across a network of 15 plants. Siemens‚Äô highly integrated portfolio, deep industry experience and market leadership will be a real differentiator for us. They are exactly the right partner to help us achieve digitalization and automation across our entire engineering and manufacturing processes.‚Äù \nSiemens created a special template for the REHAU integrated solution that leverages its full MOM portfolio, including Simatic IT UADM (MES solution), IBS QMS Professional software. The solution also includes Simatic IT Preactor APS, the leading advanced planning and scheduling system for manufacturing, as well as Simatic WinCC, the Siemens standard SCADA / HMI solution which is seamlessly connected to the shop floor. The solution is then closely integrated into Siemens‚Äô Teamcenter¬Æ software, the world‚Äôs most widely used digital lifecycle management solution, as well as into the ERP system in use at REHAU. This allows for all engineering changes to be immediately available on the shop floor, and for engineering to be integrated into the nonconformance management system through the Active Workspace Client for Teamcenter. This saves time and improves quality by providing engineers with direct, contextualized access to reported deviations and the as-built documentation. \n‚ÄúBy eliminating the major part of its legacy solutions, REHAU made a bold move that could set them apart in their industry,‚Äù said Urban August, senior vice president and managing director, Germany, Siemens PLM Software. ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0 is a pressing topic for a lot of discrete manufacturers. This is especially true for automotive suppliers who deliver just in time or sometimes even just in sequence. Lean and reliable processes throughout manufacturing are an absolute must. Our comprehensive software portfolio and the deep integration we can provide can help companies like REHAU keep ahead of the competition in their respective markets. ‚Äú \nREHAU delivers ‚ÄúUnlimited Polymer Solutions,‚Äù and is the premium worldwide brand for polymer-based innovations and systems in construction, automotive and industry. The company generates continuous growth through its expertise and innovative capabilities in materials development, systems design and surface technology. Approximately 20,000 employees at more than 170 locations around the world ensure success of the independent, privately held company. \nSiemens PLM Software, a business unit of the Siemens Digital Factory Division, is a leading global provider of software solutions to drive the digital transformation of industry, creating new opportunities for manufacturers to realize innovation. With headquarters in Plano, Texas, and over 140,000 customers worldwide, Siemens PLM Software works with companies of all sizes to transform the way ideas come to life, the way products are realized, and the way products and assets in operation are used and understood.

      "text": "Teams work better with a little help from your friends Posted Today \nHere‚Äôs something both you and your boss can agree on: Workplace teams are better when they include your friends. \nResearchers analyzed the results of 26 different studies (called a meta-analysis) and found that teams composed of friends performed better on some tasks than groups of acquaintances or strangers. \nTeams with friends were particularly effective when the groups were larger and when their focus was on maximizing output. \n‚ÄúWorking with friends is not just something that makes us feel good ‚Äì it can actually produce better results,‚Äù said Robert Lount, co-author of the study and associate professor of management and human resources at The Ohio State University‚Äôs Fisher College of Business. \nThe study was led by Seunghoo Chung, a doctoral student in management and human resources at Ohio State. The results appear online in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and will be published in a future print edition. \nThe researchers analyzed studies about teams that used participants with established friendships and that included teams with non-friends or acquaintances as a comparison group. All the studies also clearly measured task performance. \nIn the end, the 26 studies they analyzed included 1,016 groups with 3,467 participants. \nOverall, results showed friendship groups had a clear performance advantage, whether the tasks required brawn or brains. The advantage was found in all age groups. \nThe larger the teams studied, the bigger the positive effect of friendship groups, the study found. \n‚ÄúFriends can coordinate tasks more effectively,‚Äù Chung said. ‚ÄúThey know each other‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses and can figure out how to break up the work in the most efficient way.‚Äù \nFindings showed that friendship groups did better in tasks where the goal was to produce the most output, but did not have an advantage when the goal was to find the optimal solution to a problem. \nWhen the goal is maximizing output, the biggest issue is often keeping people motivated, and that‚Äôs where friends are helpful, Chung said. \n‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre working with friends, you tend to be in a better mood and can work through the adversity and strain that sometimes comes from having to produce a lot in a short time,‚Äù Chung said. \nBut when the goal is coming up with the best answer to a problem, there may be an upside to working with strangers, Lount said. \nPeople who are not friends may be more likely to constructively disagree, to talk about the pros and cons of a proposed solution, and be less likely to just go along with the crowd. \nOverall, Lount said the results suggest that managers should consider (non-mandatory) social events and team-building exercises that encourage friendships. \n‚ÄúWhen employees are having fun together, it may have long-term benefits for productivity,‚Äù he said. \n‚ÄúAs a manager, you must balance allowing friends the opportunity to socialize, but also making sure that they don‚Äôt spend too much time at the water cooler.‚Äù \nThe bottom line is that managers should look for ways to build teams around groups of friends, Chung said. \n‚ÄúIt is a good way to enhance performance,‚Äù he said.",

This application is tantamount to coalescence between Watlington and Pyrton. \n‚ÄúThe number of houses on this site would impact on Watlington over and above those allocated to the town in the neighbourhood plan.‚Äù \nSouth Oxfordshire District Council, the planning authority, will make the final decision. 23 October 2017",

      "text": "On Board with the Data Revolution? 24 Oct, 2017 Yammer x \nThe bold businesses at the crest of the wave of digital transformation ‚Äì ready to surf the data economy with the agility of a Bondi brother as they shift from CAPEX to OPEX strategies ‚Äì appear to be in the minority. Yet the energy is building and data management companies like NetApp have their boards waxed and ready to steer businesses through the waves. \nAs the world looks up to its contemporary giants, like Uber and Airbnb, so worldwide spending on digital transformation is set to rocket. The question is, will your business be looking on in admiration, or will it be out there making waves with the pros? With NetApp‚Äôs data management ecosystem in place to maximise scalability and flexibility within the data fabric, any business can climb those frothy peaks. So what‚Äôs holding them back? \nTechnological advances have awakened businesses to the service-based enterprise, entrenching fundamental shifts in business strategies that enable them to scale out their businesses to dramatic proportions. More traditional businesses can jump on board too, but despite the enticing fairy-tale of the modern start-up and the exponential rise in spend on digital transformation, set to hit $2.1 trillion in 2019, a recent Dell survey suggests many businesses are less enthused. \nWhile there will always be the innovators, leading the way with their bold new ‚Äòtricks‚Äô, there will also be the willing adopters, quick to jump up on that ‚Äòboard‚Äô themselves. Then there are the followers with only tentative plans to engage, the cautious evaluators that let others test the business waters ‚Äì and of course, the laggards. According to Dell, 41% of the 4,000 large enterprises surveyed around the world fall into the ‚Äòfollower‚Äô category and 24% were identified as evaluators. Meanwhile, 19% were classified as laggards. So much for a digital revolution, right? 86% of Britain‚Äôs biggest businesses have assessed their risk of digital disruption Click to Tweet \nChange, especially at speed, quite naturally evokes fear. Indeed 41% of Dell‚Äôs respondents said they were uncomfortable with the pace of the technological changes. But that‚Äôs not to say that businesses aren‚Äôt taking it seriously. Learning and development experts AVADO found that 86 percent of Britain‚Äôs biggest businesses have assessed their risk of digital disruption, with the majority putting a c-suite executive in charge of driving digital change. Swimming against the tide or opting out is simply not an option for those businesses that want to compete. \nTapping into the data economy means businesses can streamline their services, switch to the service-based enterprise and offer increasingly personalised services. The resulting shift in business models from CAPEX to OPEX, means channelling serious investment into digital transformation. For example, Walmart is set to spend $2 billion in order to overhaul its core capabilities and boost digital engagement. Similarly, General Electric is spending $1 billion every year in its quest for digital dominance. Meanwhile, start-ups are exploiting their agility by developing digitally native businesses from the get-go ‚Äì asserting themselves as market disruptors. \nAs the conversation around digital disruption rumbles on, inspiring the Leaders and unnerving the Evaluators, it is data that is keeping the economy afloat. Currents of data streaming through our everyday lives ‚Äì connecting our personal desires and needs with the businesses that can alleviate them ‚Äì are the future of retail, healthcare and manufacturing. Scalable, real-time data management keeps businesses in action and their customers contented. Data management companies like NetApp are omnipresent and as ubiquitous as the tides of data they manage. With the NetApp‚Äôs infrastructural provisions and data management to support business‚Äô service-focused software, any business can command the surf and ride the crest of digital transformation. 5",

      "text": "The Yorkshire Evening Post fans‚Äô jury has its say after Leeds United 3-0 victory at Ashton Gate. \nDAVID WATKINS 'Spanish Wizard' Samuel Saiz. PIC: Jonathan Gawthorpe \nWell, I certainly didn‚Äôt see that coming! Leeds United found a winning formula again and came back to life as quickly as our form dipped about a month ago. \nThe inclusion of Ronnie Vieira ‚Äì called for by most Leeds fans in recent weeks ‚Äì made a huge difference as did the formation change to include a four-man midfield engine room of Samueal Saiz, Ronaldo Vieira, Eunan O‚ÄôKane and Kalvin Phillips. \nPerhaps we also needed that bit of luck in the fourth minute as a clearance rebounded off Phillips into the path of Pierre-Michel Lasogga before a wicked deflection then guided Saiz‚Äôs shot perfectly into the back of the net. \nYou make your own luck they say and Leeds worked hard to press the home side from the start and they never really troubled us apart from a couple of solid saves from Andy Lonergan. \nThis was the perfect all round performance, and a perfectly timed one to calm everyone‚Äôs nerves. \nMan of the match: Ronaldo Vieira. \nMATTHEW EVANS \nA vastly-improved performance that was as much down to attitude and approach than personnel and positions. \nIt‚Äôs true that Matthew Pennington and Ronaldo Vieira brought some fresh thinking to the side but the application of the players was far better than in recent games and we got exactly what we deserved. \nEarly doors it looked like Bristol could be in for a battering and it was clear that the do-or-die attitude of earlier in the season had returned to the United ranks. \nCity got a foothold in the game and we had some quiet spells but they never looked like threatening. \nTheir frustration boiled over late on with Taylor and Berardi shown deserved red cards. A solid performance at the back was topped by excellent performances from Vieira, Alioski and Saiz ‚Äì further forward ‚Äì while Lasogga enjoyed a best showing since his debut. \nKalvin Phillips was the star of the show, however, just as the more fickle of our fans had begun to write him off ‚Äì once again. \nIt was a much-needed boost ahead of a tough game at Leicester but we should go there with no inhibitions and try to make the quarter -inals for the second year in a row. \nMan of the match: Kalvin Phillips. \nKEITH INGHAM \nJust when it seemed it was going a little sideways, Leeds stormed back with a fantastic 3-0 win over fourth-placed Bristol City. \nThe win ‚Äòleapfrogs‚Äô Leeds over their hosts and they now sit fourth in the Championship table. Leeds dominated the early minutes and were 2-0 up by the 15th minute, Samuel Siaz with both the goals. \nLeeds increased their lead in the second half when Pierre-Michel Lasogga headed in Kalvin Phillips‚Äô corner. \nThe only blot on a superb performance was Gaetano Berardi‚Äôs sending off 11 minutes from time. \nBristol City‚Äôs Matt Taylor was also sent off for involvement in the same incident. Berardi now misses the next three games against Leicester, Sheffield United and Derby County. \nThomas Christainsen showed that despite recent set backs he has the tactical nouse to alter things to counter different teams. He certainly did his homework on in-form Bristol City and the results were there for all to see. \nA superb victory! \nA cup tie against Leicester City tomorrow awaits and expect a few changes with the Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United only a few days afterwards. \nMan of the match: All the team deserve credit. \nGARY NEWBOULD \nAs hurricane Brian descended, it was United who produced a barnstorming performance at Ashton Gate on Saturday afternoon to record a 3-0 victory and head back up to fourth in the Championship. \nAfter three miserable defeats on the bounce for the Whites and the hosts unbeaten in more than ten games, logic suggested there was little chance of an away victory. \nBut when did logic ever apply in the Championship? \nThe loyal hordes, who numbered almost 4,000, welcomed the inclusion of Ronaldo Vieira on the starting XI, but were shocked by Pontus Jansson being dropped to the bench and replaced by Matthew Pennington. However, the Swede himself had described his own recent performances as, shall we say, ‚Äòpoor‚Äô on social media over the week. \nUnited were quickly out of the traps and by the time 14 minutes were on the clock they were two goals to the good and leaving Elland Road‚Äôs ‚ÄòSpanish Wizard‚Äô Samuel Saiz having over an hour left to claim a hat-trick. \nThe quality of football totally justified the change of personnel and formation and a third and final goal came just after the hour mark, courtesy of Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who looked much more full of energy throughout. \nMan of the match: Ronaldo Vieira. \nMIKE GILL \nBRISTOL CITY boss Lee Johnson said before the game that City had not been comprehensively beaten by anybody this season. \nWell they have now! As expected Leeds United strengthened up the midfield adding the muscular Ronaldo Vieira. Matthew Pennington was preferred to Pontus Jansson and Gjanni Alioski returned to the starting line-up. \nVieira‚Äôs inclusion allowed the excellent Samuel Saiz to remind us what he is capable of. \nTwo well-taken goals in 14 minutes sent Bristol City reeling and United dominated the first half. \nApart from about ten or so minutes, the second half followed along the same lines. \nWhen a revitalised Pierre-Michel Lasogga scored a fine header from a Kalvin Phillips corner on 67 minutes, the game was all but over. \nThe euphoria at the beginning of the season was probably misplaced ‚Äì as was the doom and gloom of recent times. \nWhat we do have is a strong squad and a good and brave coach. \nMan of the match: Ronaldo Vieira.

      "text": "Have your say \nRonaldo Vieira won the admiration of Bristol City manager Lee Johnson and admitted the threat of a fourth straight loss had driven Leeds United to one of their most convincing performances of the season in a 3-0 victory at Ashton Gate. \nThe 19-year-old was named in United‚Äôs starting line-up for the first time in a league game this term and contributed heavily to a rejuvenated display which stemmed the flow of defeats suffered by Thomas Christiansen‚Äôs side. Samuel Saiz celebrates scoring the opening goal against Bristol City. \nLeeds had dropped from first place in the Championship to sixth during a run of four losses in five games but climbed back up to fourth yesterday by ending Bristol City‚Äôs 12-match unbeaten run and inflicting their first home defeat. \nChristiansen responded to calls to strengthen his midfield by drafting in Vieira and allowing Kalvin Phillips to assume a more attacking role. Leeds scored twice in the first 15 minutes through a Samuel Saiz brace and sealed their win in the second half with a header from Pierre-Michel Lasogga. \nJohnson credited England Under-20 international Vieira for ‚Äúrunning the show‚Äù and Vieira said: ‚ÄúWe just knew we had to win the game. \n‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt go four games in a row losing if we wanted to be up there at the end of the season. All the boys worked hard during the week. Ronaldo Vieira battles in midfield against Bristol City. \n‚ÄúWe had a lot of meetings about Bristol and they‚Äôre a good team but I think we overlooked them and just tried to get the three points.‚Äù \nChristiansen came in for criticism for the first time since his appointment as head coach as an impressive start to the season faded either side of the recent international break but Vieira insisted the term was still in its infancy and said United‚Äôs players had not been suffering from excessive pressure. \n‚ÄúFrom the outside I felt it but from the inside, it‚Äôs still early,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll still be early until after Christmas. \n‚ÄúObviously the fans want to win and if we lose three games there‚Äôs a lot of pressure from the outside but on the inside everyone knew that we‚Äôve got time, we‚Äôre still up there and still had a chance. \n‚ÄúThere were only six points between four teams and you can get that in four days, Saturday to Tuesday. Everyone‚Äôs happy and hopefully we can carry it on.‚Äù \nVieira made a huge impact last season during his first year as a professional with Leeds, earning a maiden England youth cap and a new four-year contract as a result, but a combination of injury and Christiansen‚Äôs selection policy had denied him a start in any of United‚Äôs initial 12 league games. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm just pleased to be back out there enjoying myself and helping the team as much as I can,‚Äù Vieira said. \n‚ÄúI feel like I took my chance well but I came into the game just thinking ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to do as much as I can to help the team.‚Äô I thought I did well and we‚Äôll see what happens now.‚Äù Leeds United Nostalgia: Maverick midfielder Batty proved vital man for United Bristol City 0 Leeds United 3: Coach Christiansen dedicates weekend win at City to Dallas Sign in",

      "text": "Have your say \nThomas Christiansen has ordered his players to ignore Leicester City‚Äôs poor form and forget the idea that the Premier League club might be there for the taking when Leeds United bid to reach the Carabao Cup quarter-finals tomorrow. \nLeeds will be hosted by the former Premier League champions a week after Leicester reacted to a weak start to the season by sacking manager Craig Shakespeare. Leeds United head coach Thomas Christiansen. \nCity are under the caretaker control of assistant and former Oxford United boss Michael Appleton but a 2-1 win at Swansea City in Appleton‚Äôs first game in charge on Saturday lifted the club out of the top flight‚Äôs relegation places. \nLeicester have yet to decide on a permanent replacement for Shakespeare, who only replaced title winner Claudio Ranieri on a full-time basis in June, but United head coach Christiansen warned that this evening could be ‚Äúthe most dangerous time‚Äù to face a club who have experienced their share of turmoil since dramatically winning the Premier League in 2016. \nLeeds are attempting to scalp a top-flight side for the second time in the Carabao Cup having reached the last 16 by beating Burnley on penalties in the third round. \n‚ÄúLeicester had a good win this weekend, a win that can give them confidence back,‚Äù Christiansen said. Luke Ayling and Leeds United celebrate after beating Burnley on penalties in the third round of the Carabao Cup. \n‚ÄúYou never know when‚Äôs a good time (to play another club). When a team are hurt and they‚Äôre suffering down the table, that‚Äôs probably when it‚Äôs most dangerous to face them. You never know when is the right moment. \n‚ÄúWe faced Burnley when they were seventh in the league, playing well and getting important points and we managed to qualify for the next round. Anything can happen.‚Äù \nLeeds are looking for a second quarter-final appearance in two years having made the last eight of the League Cup under Garry Monk last season. United eventually suffered a narrow defeat to Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool at Anfield. \nAsked about the lure of moving closer to the latter stages and a possible future appearance at Wembley, Christiansen said: ‚ÄúThose are big words but I will try to win all of our games and I‚Äôll try to pass as many rounds as possible ‚Äì trying to do it in the best way for the team. \n‚ÄúWe also have to face the reality that we‚Äôve faced one Premier League team, we‚Äôre going to face another one and, if we have the luck to pass to the next round, we‚Äôll face another, perhaps a very strong Premier League team. \n‚ÄúWe just have to enjoy the moment and the game in front of us.‚Äù \nChristiansen‚Äôs squad stabilised their own league form after three successive defeats with an impressive 3-0 win at Bristol City on Saturday, the first of three matches in seven days. \nUnited, who are fourth in the Championship, contest a Yorkshire derby against third-placed Sheffield United on Friday but Christiansen denied that he would prioritise that fixture over the trip to Leicester, saying: ‚ÄúBoth are important. More than looking at both games, I will look at the players I have.‚Äù \nThe Leeds boss, however, was pleased with a result at Ashton Gate which repaired damaged confidence at Elland Road following a sudden drop in the from which took the club to the top of the Championship last month. \n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt lose (confidence) so fast and we don‚Äôt get it back so fast,‚Äù Christiansen said, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs the beginning of us recovering that confidence. It comes when the players see they do things right but I see and I believe that all the players are giving their best.‚Äù Video - Leeds United: Foxes cup tie gives Jansson chance to push for recall - Christiansen Leeds United team news: Grieving Dallas to miss Leicester City trip Sign in",

      "text": "Arsene Wenger to stick with rotation policy for Carabao Cup tie against Norwich Monday 23 October 2017 The Frenchman has never won the competition during his 21-year spell in charge of Arsenal. \nArsene Wenger will continue with the ‚Äòluxury‚Äô of rotating his Arsenal side and believes he has the squad depth to succeed while doing so. \nThe Gunners welcome Norwich to the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup. \nIt remains the one domestic trophy to elude Wenger during his time in England, with the Frenchman known for using the competition to blood young talent. \n‚Äî Carabao Cup (@Carabao_Cup) September 26, 2017 \nWenger √¢ who saw his side win 5-2 at Everton on Sunday in a result which saw Ronald Koeman lose his job as Toffees boss less than 24 hours later √¢ insists he will continue with the same approach, which he has also applied in the Europa League this season. \n√¢I will continue to rotate,√¢ he said. \n√¢I√¢ve gone into that rotation policy and afterwards you have to continue to do it, especially when both teams work well and both teams support each other at the moment. \n√¢I must say that it√¢s difficult to make a change because to win away from home in the way we did at Belgrade, you need some special quality. Let√¢s hope we can reiterate that against Norwich. \n‚Äî Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) October 23, 2017 \n√¢That√¢s the luxury I have at the moment and the difficulty I have as well. All these players do well, play well and they deserve to play. \n√¢Fortunately, we have important games every week, so I can give competition to everybody. As you said, we have so much offensive force on the bench as well. It√¢s really a strong point of the club at the moment.√¢ \nWenger came close to winning the League Cup in 2011 but his side were surprisingly beaten by Birmingham in the final. \n‚Äî Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) October 23, 2017 \nHe believes his current pool of players is strong enough to keep going in the Carabao Cup while offering the chance to give vital minutes to fringe players and youngsters. \n√¢I always used it to give a chance to young boys,√¢ he said when asked about never winning the League Cup. \n√¢We went to the final with a very young team and nearly won it. I always focus on winning trophies in the Premier League and FA Cup domestically, and always used the League Cup as an education for our young players. But with this team I have the squad to go further, so let√¢s see.√¢ ???? \"I love the cup competition‚Ä¶ I like do-or-die games.\" #ncfc pic.twitter.com/Plrhcfvzjo \n‚Äî Norwich City FC (@NorwichCityFC) October 23, 2017 \nWenger, who toasted his 68th birthday as his side saw off Everton, revealed he spent the rest of the day celebrating in the only way he wanted to √¢ by watching more football. \n√¢I didn√¢t really have a chance to celebrate,√¢ he added. \n√¢But most importantly, I enjoyed the day because we won and had a convincing result and played good football, and the team looked happy. \n√¢After that, last night there was a good French game, Marseille v Paris St Germain, which I could not miss! So in the end, I didn√¢t even go out for dinner because I planned to watch the game.√¢",

      "text": "Chelsea v Everton   25th October 2017 24th October 2017 / lee Chelsea v Everton EFL Cup, 25th October 7.45pm \nThe Toffees go to Stamford Bridge for their first game since the sacking of Ronald Koeman. Their poor season continued on the weekend with a home drubbing coming at the hands of Arsenal. Chelsea showed a bit of character on the weekend to fight back at home from behind to beat Watford. The Blues are 4/9 odds on at William Hill to win , with the draw at 15/4 and Everton at a big 7/1 price. Chelsea v Everton   \nLate goals at the Bridge on the weekend saw Chelsea come from behind against Watford to land a win. But could have been a very different story if the Hornets hadn‚Äôt been so wasteful in front of goal. Still, Chelsea‚Äôs spirits will have been boosted by that win, which is their only victory in their last four in all competitions now. They haven‚Äôt looked great at the back but both teams NOT to score at William Hill looks some value at 19/20. The Blues have won their last three games against Everton without conceding and have taken four clean sheets in their last five games against the Toffees at Stamford Bridge. One of those was a 2-0 win that Chelsea put up in this season‚Äôs Premier League over the Toffees back at the end of August with goals from Cesc Fabregas and Alvaro Morata. A Chelsea 2-0 correct score is a 6/1 punt at William Hill, with the 1-0 victory for them at the same price. You will have the coverage of a Chelsea to win to nil at 7/5 with William Hill . Michy Batshuayi looks to have a great scoring touch at the moment and he is 8/11 in the anytime goalscorer market. \nEverton haven‚Äôt won any of their last six games out on the road this season and they have now lost three of their last four road games (D1) in all competitions this season, failing to score in three of those as well. The Toffees gave Ronald Koeman the boot after a 5-2 hammering at Goodison Park against Arsenal on the weekend and they are looking shaky at the back and a bit clueless going forward. Wayne Rooney is their shortest priced anytime goalscorer option at 3/1. The Toffees have conceded at least two goals now each of their last three games against the Blues and can‚Äôt be trusted in this one. In the last round of the League Cup they took a 3-0 home win over Sunderland and that is just one of two wins in their last thirteen games across all conditions now (D4 L7). They have a lot of work to do and they have taken just the one clean sheet in their last thirteen games. Who will win ‚Äì Chelsea v Everton EFL Cup Predictions \nChelsea to win: A change of manager won‚Äôt necessarily change the fortunes of Everton overnight at all. Chelsea showed decent character on the weekend and while their back line looks shaky, Everton don‚Äôt have the attacking threat to hurt it enough. The tip is based on the personal opinion of the author. No success is guaranteed. Please gamble responsibly. 18+",

      "text": "How Ronald Koeman's Everton sacking unfolded during a Manic Monday at Goodison Park The Blues are looking for a new boss, with David Unsworth and John Ebbrell in temporary charge   Everton FC   Could   \nIn the end it turned into a Manic Monday at Goodison Park. \nThe morning papers had lamented another hopeless Everton showing, while across social media Blues fans had their say. Plenty wanted a change. \nStill, the feeling generally was that it was unlikely ‚Äì for now at least. \nAnd then at 1.30pm, came the four-line statement that would change everything. \n‚ÄúEverton Football Club can confirm that Ronald Koeman has left the club,‚Äù it read. \n‚ÄúChairman Bill Kenwright, the board of directors and major shareholder Farhad Moshiri would all like to express their gratitude to Ronald for the service he has given to the club over the past 16 months and for guiding the club to seventh place in last season‚Äôs Premier League campaign.‚Äù \nHe'd gone. Koeman - in his own words \nEarlier in the day Dutch journalist, and Koeman confidante, Marcel van der Kraan had told Sky Sports News that Koeman still felt he had the backing of both Kenwright and Moshiri; he didn't, he said, feel ‚Äúfinished‚Äù. \nHis faith was swiftly proven misplaced. He leaves Everton in the bottom three of the Premier League, having overseen their worst start to a season in a dozen years. They're struggling for goals at one end, and leaking them alarmingly at the other. \nHe will be followed out of the door by his brother Erwin, his first-team coach, as well as fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg and goalkeeping coach Patrick Lodewijks. \nDavid Unsworth and John Ebbrell, Everton's U23s coaches, will take charge of the first-team as they prepare for Wednesday's Carabao Cup trip to Chelsea. Unsworth could be given longer than his last interim spell, which was just one game, as the Blues consider their options in terms of a long-term successor. Read More",

      "text": "Football Gary Neville 'stunned' by Manchester United's humbling at Huddersfield Shock defeat raises importance of United's Premier League clash with Tottenham at Old Trafford, former England defender says. Close Jose Mourinho rips into Manchester United players after shock Huddersfield defeat Hayters \nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville has described the Red Devils' 2-1 defeat to Huddersfield on 21 October as \"a big shock\". \nErrors from Juan Mata and Victor Lindelof led to the Terriers establishing a 2-0 lead in the first half at the John Smith's Stadium, with Marcus Rashford scoring a late consolation goal for the visitors. \nThe defeat was United's first in the Premier League this season, with manager Jose Mourinho saying in the post-match interview that the attitude of his players at newly-promoted Huddersfield was worse than in a friendly match. \nNeville said he did not expect his former club to stumble at the John Smith's Stadium, given their impressive start to the season, and went on to say that he was \"stunned\" by Mourinho's comments. \n\"I thought it would be tough for United because of the atmosphere but I also thought they'd come through it. I was stunned by the result,\" the former England defender told Sky Sports . \n\"I was stunned also by Jose Mourinho's comments afterwards about the application of the players, saying it was the worst he's seen them up for the game. \n\"It was a big shock and bad goals to concede. Lindelof made a couple of poor mistakes. I think if the other team does something brilliant, you can recover from it but you don't give yourself a chance if you're making poor mistakes. Jose Mourinho admitted Huddersfield deserved to beat his Manchester United team at the John Smith's Stadium Getty Images \n\"When your goalkeeper, defenders are making poor mistakes, the anxiety runs not only into the team but into the crowd.\" \nUnited's defeat allowed Tottenham to move level on points with them in second place heading into the pair's Premier League clash at Old Trafford on 28 October. \nSpurs are in high spirits after securing a 1-1 draw at Real Madrid in the Champions League and following it up with a 4-1 thrashing of Liverpool at Wembley over the weekend. \n\"Saturday is now a huge game for United to get back on their bike after falling off,\" Neville added. \"They're playing against a Tottenham side with great confidence. \n\"If Tottenham play anything like they did [against Liverpool], Manchester United will have to be at their best ‚Äì they can't be below.\" More from IBTimes UK Sport",

Neymar and Messi played together for four seasons (Image: Getty Images Europe) Lionel Messi and wife Antonella Roccuzzo arrive (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nThe votes from the manager and captain of each national team nominates were revealed. A media representative from each country was given the same opportunity. \nArgentina captain Messi voted for Luis Suarez (first), Andres Iniesta (second) and Neymar (third). The shortlist for the top men's player of the year was Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nEngland captain Jordan Henderson voted for Ronaldo then Messi and then former team-mate Suarez. Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate, meanwhile, opted for Ronaldo, Modric and Toni Kroos. \nWales captain Ashley Williams did not take part in the vote. His manager Chris Coleman did, however. He picked Ramos, Modric and Harry Kane. \nTottenham striker Kane also picked up nominations from British Virgin Islands captain Troy Ceasar Kavon, France skipper Hugo Lloris, Motserrat's Anthony Griffith and Dio Godet of the Bahamas. \nOther Premier League players to pick up nominations include Alexis Sanchez, N'Golo Kante, Eden Hazard and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Harry Kane picked up a few votes (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nScotland manager Gordon Strachan Voted for Modric, Kante and Messi while captain Scott Brown went for Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar. \nNorthern Ireland skipper Steven Davis selected Rnaldo, Messi and Gianluigi Buffon while his international manager Michael O'Neill chose Ronaldo, Hazard and Kante. \nSouth of the border, Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill voted for Ronaldo, Messi and Hazard. Seamus Coleman selected Ronaldo, Messi and Juventus forward Paulo Dybala. \nGermany captain Manuel Neuer voted for Kroos, Robert Lewandowski and Arturo Vidal. World Cup winning manager Joachim Low voted for Kroos, Neuer and Neymar. The full list of votes: (Image: FIFA)",

We can‚Äôt worry about other things.‚Äù\nMerino joined Newcastle during the summer transfer window, and he has immediately impressed at St. James‚Äô Park.\n\nThe 21-year-old‚Äôs loan move from Borussia Dortmund has already been made permanent, with Newcastle acting quickly to snap up the midfielder.\nMerino scored Newcastle‚Äôs winner in their most recent fixture, as Rafael Benitez‚Äôs side overcame the challenge of Crystal Palace.\nNewcastle have made an impressive start to their campaign, and currently sit in seventh place in the Premier League table.\n\nShow Comments",

Spain \nValencia midfielder Carlos Soler has emerged as a Manchester United target . The 20-year-old signed a new deal with the La Liga club in May until June 2021, with a buyout clause of ‚Ç¨80m (¬£71.2m). United would not be willing to trigger that clause, but are said to be interested in making a bid of around ¬£30m for a player who made his professional debut less than a year ago. ( Marca) \nReal Madrid were the big winners at FIFA's The Best awards on Monday night. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned Male Player of the Year for the second year in a row ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar.

( Marca) Italy \nBarcelona boss Ernesto Valverde has refused to rule out a move for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho. The La Liga side chased the Brazilian playmaker all summer and, although they signed Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund, they are expected to return with a bid in January. \"Coutinho? If we do sign some players in the future,\" Valverde said. \"I would like it to be done quietly. We do not want it to be everywhere in the media like last summer.\" ( Calciomercato) Barca boss Ernesto Valverde has not ruled out a move for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho \nChelsea head coach Antonio Conte insists that he does not fear the sack at Stamford Bridge. The Blues are fourth in the Premier League table, nine points behind leaders Manchester City after an indifferent start which has seen them lose three times. \nHowever, Conte - who led Chelsea to the league title in May - is not fretting over his future. \"I understand that the club has to evaluate my performances but sincerely I am not worried about getting sacked if I lose a game for example,\" he said. ( Calciomercato) \nAC Milan defender Leonardo Bonucci has apologised to his team-mates after his red card in the 0-0 draw with Genoa.

( Die Welt) Bayern turned down the chance to sign Naby Keita France \nFormer Crystal Palace goalkeeper Steve Mandanda has been named the Ligue 1 player of the month for September. The Marseille stopper pipped Manchester United target Malcom of Bordeaux, Neymar and Monaco's Radamel Falcao to the award.

Specifically, it's a fourth round meeting between Swansea City FC and the red-favouring team from Manchester known, of course, as Manchester United . When is it? \nTonight, that is Tuesday 24 October 2017. What time is kick-off? \nIt's 19.45 BST. Yes, we are still inside the BST zone.

What is the team news? \nVictor Lindelof's display for Manchester United against Huddersfield could cost him a starting place in Tuesday's Carabao Cup trip to Swansea. \nLindelof did not impress after coming on for the injured Phil Jones during Saturday's defeat and Jose Mourinho could choose to look at Axel Tuanzebe. \nOther changes are likely for the last-16 match, with Luke Shaw, Scott McTominay, Matteo Darmian, Sergio Romero and Daley Blind all under consideration. \nProvisional Man Utd squad: De Gea, Romero, Pereira, Valencia, Darmian, Tuanzebe, Lindelof, Smalling, Blind, Shaw, Young, Matic, Herrera, McTominay, Mata, Lingard, Mkhitaryan, Lukaku, Rashford, Martial. Who should Man Utd pick to face Swansea? \nR oque Mesa has started only three times since his ¬£11million summer move from Las Palmas, but Swansea head coach Paul Clement confirmed that the midfielder will line up against United. \nRenato Sanches (thigh) is unavailable after joining Wilfried Bony (hamstring) and Kyle Bartley on the casualty list, while goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski is set to be rested. \nProvisional Swansea squad: Nordfeldt, Rangel, van der Hoorn, Mawson, Olsson, Mesa, Ki, Clucas, Dyer, Ayew, Abraham, Mulder, Naughton, Fernandez, Britton, Carroll, Narsingh, Fulton, Routledge, McBurnie. What are they saying? \nJuan Mata wants Manchester United to show unity as they look to bounce back from their lacklustre defeat at Huddersfield. \nUnited's first Premier League defeat of the season, a leaden-footed 2-1 reverse, saw manager Jose Mourinho tear into his side's \"poor attitude\" and lack of desire. \nBut Mata, who was hooked at half-time at the John Smith's Stadium, has called for the team to pull together and return to the methods which saw them secure 10 wins and two draws from their previous 12 matches. Mata expects United to bounce back after their surprise defeat to Huddersfield Credit: ACTION IMAGES \nI n his blog on the club's website, the Spaniard wrote: \"We knew this moment would arrive sooner or later, although that's something you never wish for, of course. \n\"Now, it's time to learn from mistakes and keep going, as we always do, showing that the team sticks together when things don't go so well, which is when we need it most. \n\"Since the European Super Cup defeat last summer, we've been performing really well against all kind of opponents. On Saturday, though, Huddersfield played their cards better than us and took all three points. All we can do now is congratulate them and move on. This is a not a sprint, but a marathon and there is still a long way to go. \n\"Let's not forget that, before that game, we had got a good win in Lisbon. We beat a very good side in Benfica, a team with plenty of Champions League experience.\" \n\"It's going to be a tough game,\" wrote Mata of the Swansea tie. \n\"But, we are the reigning champions and we will try our best to win and keep moving forward. There's another big game next weekend, this time against Tottenham. \n\"They're one of the most difficult teams to beat in the top-flight, and it's a key game for us to show all the virtues we have been talking about over the last two months.\"",

Some said that was typical of Buhari, a man sold to Nigerians as taciturn, a man of ramrod‚Ä¶ Yoruba nation: (Dis) unity, national politics and the republican spirit [I] ‚Äî 22nd October 2017 \nThe historical and sociopolitical narratives of the Yor√πb√° nation is an interesting and thought-provoking one since the unraveling of the multiple historical circumstances that threw up the Yor√πb√° as a significant factor in colonial ad postcolonial politics in Nigeria. Permit me therefore to commence by paying glowing tribute to two avatar of Yor√πb√° history and‚Ä¶ Dignity of the Nigerian military ‚Äî 22nd October 2017 \nThe issue of a standard Nigeria Army is one matter that should be in the minds of every true citizen.

And as this account of researchers communicated by Joseph Mercola also shows, happiness can spread to other people. Your happy or negative mood affects other people at home and in your environment. The idea that emotions can travel between populations similar to outbreaks of disease is not new. More‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúShould I get a room for you to ravage my body‚Äù ‚Äî 22nd October 2017 \nRick and I met for lunch as agreed. I wasn‚Äôt hungry but I knew if I didn‚Äôt place an order Rick will know I was nervous. So I asked for the first thing on their menu; I had no clue what it was as it was not in English but Italian. It was Ricks favourite‚Ä¶",

These results have been demonstrated to be consistently reproducible whilst also exhibiting excellent physical performance. \nThe next step will be to produce a saleable 4N (99.99%) HPA product. \nLevel 2, 66 Hunter Street Sydney NSW 2000 \nPhone: +61 2 9300 3310 Facsimile: +61 2 9221 6333 Web: www.collerinacobalt.com.au \nExtracted Aluminium \nAluminium-depleted PLS \nOrganic phase of solvent extraction showing extracted aluminium sitting above aluminium‚Äêdepleted PLS \nAbout HPA \nHPA is a white, powder‚Äêform chemical that is a pure form of Aluminium Oxide Al2O3 and is used in the non‚Äêmetallurgical alumina market across a growing range of high‚Äêperformance products and applications including LED lighting, separators for lithium‚Äêion batteries and scratch resistant artificial sapphire glass for smartphone screens and watches. \nGrowth in demand for HPA is dominated by the Asia‚ÄêPacific (APAC) region with more than 70% of current global demand emanating from China, Japan and South Korea. Conversely, current HPA supply is also dominated out the Asian Pacific region with China accounting for ~ 83% of global supply. \nWith global demand and supply dominated within the APAC region, Collerina Cobalt sees enormous opportunity as a focused HPA producer to become a genuine alternative supply source to the existing dominant APAC producing countries and more importantly fill an expected supply shortage as forecast HPA demand escalates over the next decade. \n2 \nHPA Demand Outlook (2016 ‚Äê2024) \n100 86.8kt \n80 \n60 \n40 25.3kt \n20 \n0 \n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 \n4N 5N & 6N \nSource: Persistence Market Research \nCommenting on these initial aluminium solvent extraction testwork results, Managing Director Justin Werner noted: \n\"The outstanding results from this aluminium solvent extraction testwork are a critical step in furthering our ambitions to produce a marketable High Purity Alumina (HPA) product. Having demonstrated excellent aluminium recoveries through a proprietary solvent extraction process the final step of our aluminium test work will be to produce a 4N (99.99%) HPA which is expected to be the least challenging part of the metallurgical process. Upon producing a batch sample of HPA the next milestone steps will be a mini‚Äêrig program designed to produce larger scale samples of HPA to facilitate discussions with potential offtake and funding partners and to develop pre‚Äêfeasibility level data for a 5,000 - 10,000 tpa HPA plant with associated nickel and cobalt production. With 4N HPA currently trading around US$25,000/tonne, and with a mix of high value nickel and cobalt products offering potentially significant by‚Äêproduct credits, Collerina Cobalt has the potential to become an ultra‚Äêlow cost HPA producer and an industry leader in HPA production from laterite ore. This is an exciting time for the Company and we look forward to providing the market with further updates on our progress\" 3 \nCollerina Project Location \nThe Collerina project lies about 40 kilometres south of Nyngan in the central and western region of NSW within the Lachlan Fold Belt which hosts a number of world class copper‚Äêgold mines including the Cadia, Ridgeway and Northparkes operations. The district also hosts the globally significant Syerston cobalt‚Äênickel deposit owned by Clean Teq Holdings Limited (ASX: CLQ) which contains a reported 109 million tonnes of 0.10% cobalt and 0.65% nickel. The deposit is currently under definitive feasibility study. \nThe mineralisation identified by the Company's current drilling program is spatially associated with the previously announced JORC compliant high grade cobalt and nickel resource of 16.3 million tonnes of 3.1% aluminium, 0.93% nickel and 0.05% cobalt at a 0.7% nickel cut‚Äêoff grade for 505,300 tonnes of aluminium, 151,000 tonnes of nickel and 8,100 tonnes of cobalt, which increases significantly to 27.2 million tonnes at 3.2% aluminium, 0.80% nickel and 0.05% cobalt for 870,400 tonnes of aluminium, 217,600 tonnes of nickel and 13,600 tonnes of cobalt at cut‚Äêoff 0.5% nickel. \nFor further information, please contact Peter Nightingale on +61 2 9300 3310.

      "text": "News US considers sanctions against Myanmar over Rohingya abuses The US is considering a range of actions against Myanmar over its treatment of Rohingya Muslims, including targeted sanctions. Earlier, the EU pledged ‚Ç¨30 million at a UN fundraising conference to aid fleeing Rohingya. \nIn a statement on Monday, the US State Department said it was considering a range of further actions, including targeted sanctions under its Global Magnitsky Act. \nRead more: US holds Myanmar military responsible for crackdown on Rohingya Muslims \n\"We express our gravest concern with recent events in Rakhine state and the violent, traumatic abuses Rohingya and other communities have endured,\" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, announcing the punitive measures. \n\"It is imperative that any individuals or entities responsible for atrocities, including non-state actors and vigilantes, be held accountable,\" Nauert said, adding that Washington was \"exploring accountability mechanisms available under US law.\" \nMembers of Myanmar's military involved in operations in northern Rakhine state will no longer be eligible for US assistance programs and senior security force members have been uninvited for US-sponsored events. \nNauert said the US was working with international partners to urge Myanmar to allow \"unhindered access\" to relevant areas for the UN, international humanitarian organizations and the media. Watch video 03:13 Rohingya donor conference raises $345 million \nEU pledge \nEarlier Monday, the European Commission promised to give ‚Ç¨30 million ($35 million) as the United Nations opened a fundraising conference in Geneva that aims to secure some of the $434 million sought by February for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. \n\"We need more money to keep pace with intensifying needs. This is not an isolated crisis, it is the latest round in a decades-long cycle of persecution, violence and displacement,\" Mark Lowcock, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said during the pledging conference. \nBy the end of the day, a total of nearly $345 million had been pledged by governments and international donors, the UN said, calling it an \"encouraging\" step. \nKeeping in mind past crises where the UN came up short after countries failed to deliver on their aid pledges, Lowcock stressed the importance of donors following through. \n\"Pledges are one thing,\" he told reporters. \"It's really important to us that the pledges are translated as soon as possible into contributions.\" \nEstimated 900,000 refugees \nMore than 600,000 people from the Muslim minority group, over half of them children, have fled to neighboring Bangladesh from Myanmar's northern state of Rakhine since August amid a military crackdown on the community. \nRead more: Myanmar's Rohingya ‚Äî A history of forced exoduses \nThe latest influx has brought the total number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh to an estimated 900,000. \nShameem Ahsan, Bangladesh's UN ambassador in Geneva, told the one-day conference in Switzerland that his country was facing an \"untenable situation.\" He said the Bangladeshi government was negotiating with Myanmar on the issue, but that Myanmar continued to insist that Rohingya were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. \nThe Rohingya themselves maintain that they are indigenous to western Rakhine, with roots reaching back over a thousand years. \n\"Despite claims to the contrary, violence in Rakhine state has not stopped. Thousands still enter on a daily basis,\" Ahsan said. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Fleeing Myanmar \nIn October 2016, a Rohingya group was accused of killing nine policemen in Myanmar. Since then, the Muslim minority has been under attack in the mostly Buddhist country again. More than 70,000 Rohingyas have fled across the border to Bangladesh. One of the camps they live in is Kutupalong, in the southern Cox's Bazar district. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Self-reliance required \nRohingyas might be safe from Myanmar's military here, but life in the Kutupalong camp is anything but easy. There is no real infrastructure and only makeshift housing set up by the refugees themselves. They fled Myanmar because the military torched their homes and raped and killed hundreds of people, according to human rights organizations. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh No child's play \nThere's no running water in most parts of the camp and not much to do for the thousands of refugee children. This girl is picking up mud from one of the camp's lakes. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Living in shacks \nMud and other basic materials are used by to build houses in the camp so residents at least have roofs over their heads. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Long history of conflict \nIn Myanmar, Rohingyas have been discriminated against since before the country's independence from Britain in 1948. The group continues to be denied citizenship and voting rights. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Chased away yet again? \nRohingya also experience discrimination in Bangladesh, where the government has turned away boats with hundreds of refugees because it claims that the camps are already overcrowded. Now, Bangladesh's government is planning to relocate Rohingyas to a remote island that is mostly flooded during monsoon season. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Deserted on an island \nThe island of Thengar Char, where Bangladesh's government wants to settle Rohingyas, is miles away from the mainland, can only be reached by boat and has been raided by pirates before. An NGO coordinator helping Rohingyas once told DW that there would be few opportunities to make a living on Thengar Char. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Bad track record \nBangladeshi Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali has acknowledged that there is still a lot of work to be done on Thengar Char. \"'The relocation will take place only after the development activities are completed,'' he has said. But the government hasn't done much to improve the Kutupalong camp either, and residents have to take care of everything themselves. Forgotten refugees: Rohingyas make a home in Bangladesh Erased from history \nThe lack of a safe homeland leaves Rohingyas with an uncertain future as Myanmar works to erase their past. The Culture and Religious Affairs Ministry plans to release a history textbook with no mention whatsoever of the Muslim minority. \"The real truth is that the word 'Rohingya' was never used or existed as an ethnicity or race in Myanmar's history,\" the ministry claimed in December 2016. Author: Carla Bleiker \nCruel crackdown \nThe meeting was co-hosted by the European Union and Kuwait, which pledged $15 million. \nThe UK stepped up its pledge for the aid effort, bringing its total contribution to 47 million pounds ($62 million) while Australia pledged 10 million Australian dollars ($7.8 million). \n\"We are here today because, sadly, the needs are even greater than we can provide with our current resources,\" Elisabeth Rasmusson, the deputy chief of the World Food Program, told the conference. \n\"[On] behalf of the people we are trying to help, we must ask you for more.\" \nLowcock also urged for Myanmar to allow \"full humanitarian access across Rakhine\" where aid agencies have been blocked from entering. \nThe UN has said that Myanmar government troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist monks have been carrying out a campaign of killings, arson and rape since late August that is tantamount to ethnic cleansing. \nrs, jm/cmk (Reuters, dpa, AFP) Watch video 04:11 Human Rights Watch Germany on Rohingya crisis DW recommends",

      "text": "OVERVIEW \nTragically one fatality in Q3 2017 Total platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) maintained at 621,400 ounces, with production efficiencies across the portfolio offset by the closure of unprofitable production at Bokoni which was placed on care and maintenance Strong performances from own mine operations with Mogalakwena up 15% and Unki up 9%, partially offset by Amandelbult down 5% Joint venture production (mined and purchase of concentrate) down 4% due to a temporary stoppage of the concentrator at Mototolo, partially offset by strong performances from Modikwa and Kroondal Purchase of concentrate production from associates was down 5% primarily due to the decision to place Bokoni on care and maintenance and shut c.85,000 unprofitable ounces on an annualised basis, partially offset by a strong performance from BRPM Refined platinum production was up 29% quarter-on-quarter as part of the built-up inventory resulting from the planned Waterval smelter rebuild and the high pressure water-leak at the ACP earlier in the year was refined Sales volumes of 663,600 were up 13% REVIEW OF THE QUARTER \nSAFETY \nAnglo American Platinum tragically had one fatality in Q3 2017. Mr Douw Swart, an artisan boiler-maker suffered a chemical burns related incident on 21 August 2017 at the Precious Metals Refinery (PMR) and sadly succumbed to his injuries on 5 September 2017 in hospital. Our deepest condolences go to his family, friends and colleagues. An independent and comprehensive investigation is under way to understand the circumstances and learn from them in order to create a safer work environment for all. The Company remains committed to zero harm. \nThe Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate ('LTIFR') per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations has seen a marginal improvement, reducing to 0.76 (Q3 2016: 0.78). \nPRODUCTION \nTotal platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) was flat at 621,400 ounces with strong performances from Mogalakwena, Unki and Union, partially offset by reduced production from Bokoni mine which was placed on care and maintenance, as well as lower production from Mototolo. \nOwn mined production from managed mines \nOwn mine production decreased by 23% as a result of the sale of Rustenburg in November 2016, which became third party purchase of concentrate. \nExcluding Rustenburg, own mine production from managed mines increased 4% to 297,400 ounces. Mogalakwena production increased 15% to 116,300 ounces due to a 5% increase in built-up head grade in line with the mine plan, and a 6% increase in tons milled through the concentrators. \nAmandelbult production decreased by 5% due to lower available ore reserves and increased development as the mine transitions from Tumela Upper to Dishaba Lower UG2. This was partially offset by increased production of lower grade surface material, with an overall 11% reduction in grade compared to Q3 2016. Amandelbult production in Q3 2017 was up by 10% compared to Q2 2017. \nUnki production was up 9% to 19,800 ounces, as continued efforts in efficient mining height control have reduced mining waste, leading to increased grade and higher production. \nUnion production increased 6% to 39,900 ounces as a result of improved stoping efficiencies. The sale of Union to Siyanda Resources was announced on 15 February 2017 and is expected to complete by year-end, after which production from Union will be treated as purchase of concentrate from third parties. \nJoint venture own mined production and purchase of concentrate \nTotal joint venture production and purchase of concentrate was down 4% to 124,400 ounces (of which 62,200 ounces is own mined production and 62,200 ounces is purchase of concentrate). Mototolo production decreased by 49%. A decision was made to temporarily close the Mototolo concentrator plant following seepage detected on the tailings dam wall. Our risk assessment indicated that deposition on the tailings dam should cease until the remedial action has been completed, which should be by year-end. Mototolo mine will continue to operate and stockpile the ore on surface for future treatment. The impact of the temporary closure of the concentrator plant will impact production by c.45,000 platinum ounces in 2017. Alternative milling plans are being evaluated to assess the timing impact of the mitigation plans. \nThe decrease at Mototolo was partially offset by Modikwa which increased by 10% to 37,200 ounces, and Kroondal, which increased by 7% to 73,100 ounces due to production efficiencies. \nPurchase of concentrate from associates \nPurchase of concentrate from associates was down 5% to 73,500 ounces. Bokoni mine decreased by 32% due to the ramp-down of mining activity following the operation being placed on care and maintenance in the quarter. This was concluded on 1 October 2017 and will result in a reduction of unprofitable platinum ounces of c.20,000 in Q4 2017 and c.85,000 on an annualised basis. This was partially offset by strong production from BRPM, which increased by 7% due to strong underground production and ramp-up of Styldrift in line with mine plans. \nPurchase of concentrate from third parties \nThird party purchase of concentrate increased by 117,600 ounces to 126,200 ounces largely due to the inclusion of material from Sibanye (formally Rustenburg), which has been reported as third party purchase of concentrate since November 2016. Maseve produced 483 ounces for the period, as the mine was placed on care and maintenance by the owners Platinum Group Metals Limited. This will result in a reduction of c.60,000 platinum ounces of third party purchase of concentrate, if the mine had been performing in line with ramp-up plans for 2017. \nRefined production and sales volumes \nRefined platinum production decreased marginally by 2% to 684,100 ounces, as the comparative period refined additional inventory that had built-up following a section 54 safety stoppage at the PMR in Q1 2016. Refined platinum production was up 29% compared to Q2 2017, as additional inventory was refined following the build-up as a result of the planned Waterval Number 2 furnace rebuild in Q1 2017, and the high pressure water-leak at the ACP in Q2 2017. The remaining backlog in inventory will be refined in Q4 2017. Sales volumes for the quarter of 663,600 ounces were up 13%. \nGUIDANCE \nProduction guidance (metal in concentrate) has been revised to 2.30 - 2.35 million platinum ounces (previous 2.35 - 2.40 million platinum ounces), due to c.90,000 ounces of unprofitable production from Bokoni (c.30,000 ounces), which was placed on care and maintenance, and Maseve (c.60,000 ounces), which will no longer produce third party purchase of concentrate. In addition, the temporary closure of the Mototolo concentrator will impact full year production. Operational efficiencies across the portfolio, especially at high-margin Mogalakwena have partially offset the reduction in unprofitable production. As a result, refined production guidance has also been revised to 2.40 - 2.45 million platinum ounces (previous guidance of 2.45 - 2.50 million platinum ounces). Refined production guidance is higher than produced guidance as built-up pipeline inventory of c.100,000 ounces will be refined by year-end. \nDownload the Anglo American Platinum Limited Production Report for the third quarter ended 30 September 2017 \nAnglo American Platinum Ltd. published this content on 24 October 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 24 October 2017 06:17:05 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.angloplatinum.com/media/press-releases/2017/24-10-2017.aspx \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/694DA0C7C6FE68C4F807F99B6DCCB0056993940A",

Such a statement is required for each financial year ending on or after 31 March 2016. It should detail the steps taken to combat slavery in all parts of the business and supply chain. \nThe legislation does not specify a time-frame in which the statements have to be produced. However, government guidance suggests that publication should be within six months of the end of a company‚Äôs financial year. For organisations with a financial year that ended on 31 December 2016, the deadline for them to publish their first slavery and human trafficking statement would have been 30 June 2017. \nModern Slavery Act: slavery and human trafficking statement ‚Äì what to include \nStatements may include information on a company‚Äôs supply chains; the due diligence carried out on suppliers; any staff training initiatives that have been implemented; details of relevant policies that have been introduced; and details of how effective the measures have been in preventing slavery in the business and its supply chains. Statements need to be signed by a director and published in a prominent place on the company‚Äôs website, or be made available within 30 days of a written request. \nModern Slavery Act for Employers: worth noting \nThere is no legal obligation for an organisation to take any measures to prevent slavery taking place and any statement produced can simply state that no steps have been taken. However, given such information will be in the public domain, this approach is likely to result in loss of reputation. \nSimilarly, if a company refuses to produce a statement, only the Secretary of State has the power to apply to the courts for an order to oblige the company to do so. However, this is likely to result in negative publicity and, again, damage the company‚Äôs reputation. \nIf your organisation meets the criteria required to produce a statement under the Modern Slavery Act and you have not yet produced your slavery and human trafficking statement, you should be taking steps to publish this as soon as possible. \nIf we can support you with this process, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us on 01271 859 267.",

      "text": "0 2 [1] Constant currencies (cc), core results and free cash flow are non-IFRS measures. An explanation of non-IFRS measures can be found on page 44 of the Condensed Interim Financial Report. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates in this Release refer to same period in prior year.[2] The Alcon results of the third quarter partly benefit from stock in trade movements, contributing approximately 2% (cc) of growth.[3] Major Adverse Cardiac Events Alcon Strategic Review In early 2017, we announced a strategic review of the Alcon Division in order to explore all options to maximize value for our shareholders. We have made significant progress in our strategic review and have examined all options, ranging from retaining the business to IPO or a spin-off. As part of this, we have updated Alcon's strategic plan which confirms that it has the potential to grow sales at or above market while delivering profitability at least in line with the industry. We have also made significant progress on developing a potential capital markets solution, including financial carve-outs, tax and legal entity structuring, and identifying listing and incorporation locations. We believe the Q3 and YTD 2017 results indicate that the Alcon growth acceleration plan is beginning to generate growth, executed by a strong management team. In the near-term, Alcon will benefit from focusing on completing its turnaround in performance and leveraging the infrastructure and financial strength of Novartis. The strategic review also indicates that creating a stand-alone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. Key criteria for a final decision and timing are dependent on continued Alcon sales growth and margin improvement which need to be demonstrated for multiple quarters leading to potential action not likely before first half of 2019. Additionally, we have made the decision to move the Novartis Ophthalmic OTC products (2016 sales of USD 0.7 billion) to the Alcon Division effective January 1, 2018, where we believe the products will create most value, as they are complementary to the Alcon Vision Care business. At the same time this transfer will allow our Innovative Medicines Division to focus on delivering the exciting Novartis Rx product pipeline including RTH258. Our leading Ophthalmic prescription business (2016 sales of USD 4.8 billion) will remain with the Innovative Medicines Division. Basel, October 24, 2017 - Commenting on the results, Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis, said: \"Novartis became the first company to commercialize a CAR-T therapy, Kymriah , in Q3. Group s ales were solid, with growth in all divisions, and Alcon delivered strong growth in both sales and core operating income. We are on track to deliver our full year guidance, and have confidence in our growth phase.\" GROUP REVIEW Third quarter financials Net sales were USD 12.4 billion (+2%, +2% cc) in the third quarter, as volume growth of 7 percentage points, including growth from Cosentyx, Entresto and Alcon, was partly offset by the negative impacts of generic competition (-4 percentage points) and pricing (-1 percentage point). Operating income was USD 2.4 billion (+4%, +6% cc) mainly driven by growth drivers, productivity and a gain from a Swiss pension plan amendment, which were partly offset by generic erosion. Core adjustments amounted to USD 1.0 billion (2016: USD 1.1 billion). Net income was USD 2.1 billion (+7%, +10% cc), driven by the strong operating income and higher income from associated companies. EPS was USD 0.89 (+10%, +12% cc), driven by growth in net income and the benefit from the share buyback program. Core operating income was USD 3.4 billion (0%, +1% cc) as growth drivers and productivity offset generic erosion. Core operating income margin in constant currencies decreased 0.2 percentage points; currency had a negative impact of 0.5 percentage points, resulting in a net decrease of 0.7 percentage points to 27.2% of net sales. Core net income was USD 3.0 billion (+3%, +4% cc), driven by growth in core operating income and higher core income from associated companies. Core EPS was USD 1.29 (+5%, +6% cc), driven by growth in core net income and the benefit from the share buyback program. Free cash flow amounted to USD 3.1 billion (+18% USD) compared to USD 2.6 billion in prior year. The increase of USD 0.5 billion was mainly driven by improved cash flows from operating activities and lower net investments in intangible assets. Innovative Medicines net sales were USD 8.3 billion (+2%, +2% cc) in the third quarter. Volume contributed 8 percentage points to sales growth. Generic competition had a negative impact of 6 percentage points largely due to Gleevec/Glivec genericization in Europe and the US. Pricing impact was negligible. Operating income was USD 2.2 billion (+8%, +11% cc), mainly driven by higher sales, productivity, a gain from a Swiss pension plan amendment and lower amortization, which were partly offset by generic erosion, growth investments and lower divestment gains. Core adjustments were USD 478 million (2016: USD 656 million). Core operating income was USD 2.7 billion (-1%, +1% cc). Core operating income margin in constant currencies decreased by 0.3 percentage points due to generic erosion and growth investments for Kisqali, Cosentyx and Entresto , partly offset by sales growth and productivity; currency had a negative impact of 0.4 percentage points, resulting in a net decrease of 0.7 percentage points to 32.0% of net sales. Sandoz net sales were USD 2.6 billion (+3%, +1% cc) in the third quarter, as volume growth of 8 percentage points was offset by 7 percentage points of price erosion. Net sales across Europe and the rest of the world grew 9% (cc), offsetting the decline in the US (-13% cc). Operating income was USD 390 million (+10%, +9% cc) mainly driven by higher sales and strong gross margin expansion, partly offset by higher M&S growth investments. Core operating income was USD 580 million (+9%, +8% cc). Core operating income margin in constant currencies increased by 1.5 percentage points; currency had a negative impact of 0.2 percentage points, resulting in a net increase of 1.3 percentage points to 22.4% of net sales. Alcon net sales were USD 1.5 billion (+6%, +7% cc) in the third quarter, with growth in both franchises in all regions. Surgical sales grew 9% (cc) with broad recovery across most market segments, including strong growth from vitreoretinal products. The Division invested in expanding its new product launches, and Clareon AutonoMe IOL was approved in the EU in October. Vision Care sales grew 4% (cc), driven by the continued double-digit growth of Dailies Total1 . The Alcon results of the third quarter partly benefit from stock in trade movements, contributing approximately 2% (cc) of growth. Operating loss was USD 50 million, in line with prior year, as sales growth was offset by impairments related to business development activities. Core operating income was USD 238 million (+16%, +23% cc) driven by higher sales. Core operating income margin in constant currencies increased by 2.1 percentage points; currency had a negative impact of 0.8 percentage points, resulting in a net increase of 1.3 percentage points to 15.6% of net sales. Nine month financials Net sales were USD 36.2 billion (0%, +1% cc) in the first nine months, as volume growth of 6 percentage points, including growth from Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade and Tafinlar + Mekinist, was offset by the negative impacts of generic competition (-3 percentage points) and pricing (-2 percentage points). Operating income was USD 6.6 billion (-4%, -1% cc) as generic erosion and higher impairments were mostly offset by growth drivers, productivity and lower amortization. Core adjustments amounted to USD 3.1 billion (2016: USD 3.2 billion). Net income was USD 5.7 billion (-1%, +2% cc), due to higher income from associated companies. EPS was USD 2.43 (0%, +3% cc), driven by net income growth and the benefit from the share buyback program. Core operating income was USD 9.6 billion (-3%, -1% cc). Core operating income margin in constant currencies decreased 0.7 percentage points, mainly due to generic erosion of Gleevec/Glivec , partly offset by growth drivers and productivity; currency had a negative impact of 0.3 percentage points, resulting in a net decrease of 1.0 percentage points to 26.6% of net sales. Core net income was USD 8.6 billion (-1%, +1% cc), due to higher core income from associated companies. Core EPS was USD 3.64 (0%, +2% cc), with growth in core net income and the benefit from the share buyback program. Free cash flow amounted to USD 8.0 billion (+23% USD) compared to USD 6.5 billion in the prior year. The increase of USD 1.5 billion was mainly driven by improved cash flows from operating activities. Innovative Medicines net sales were USD 24.3 billion (0%, +2% cc) in the first nine months, as volume growth of 7 percentage points, including strong performance of Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade and Tafinlar + Mekinist, more than offset the negative impact of generic competition (-5 percentage points). Pricing impact was negligible. Operating income was USD 6.0 billion (-2%, +2% cc). Core adjustments totaled USD 1.7 billion (2016: USD 1.9 billion) and decreased compared to prior year mainly due to lower amortization. Core operating income was USD 7.7 billion (-4%, -1% cc). Core operating income margin in constant currencies decreased by 0.8 percentage points mainly due to generic erosion and growth investments for Entresto, Kisqali and Cosentyx partly offset by sales growth and productivity; currency had a negative impact of 0.3 percentage points, resulting in a net decrease of 1.1 percentage points to 31.6% of net sales. Sandoz net sales were USD 7.5 billion (-1%, -1% cc) in the first nine months, as volume growth of 6 percentage points was more than offset by 7 percentage points of price erosion. The US sales decline (-10% cc) was mostly offset by 4% (cc) growth in Europe and the rest of the world. Global Biopharmaceuticals grew 14% (cc). Operating income was USD 1.1 billion (-2%, -3% cc) mainly due to US pricing pressure and M&S growth investments, partly offset by sales growth in the rest of world and gross margin expansion. Core operating income was USD 1.5 billion (-1%, -1% cc). Core operating income margin in constant currencies decreased by 0.1 percentage points; currency had a positive impact of 0.1 percentage points, resulting in a core operating income margin of 20.6% of net sales, in line with prior year. Alcon net sales were USD 4.5 billion (+2%, +3% cc) in the first nine months. Surgical sales (+3% cc) grew, driven by strong performance of the vitreoretinal portfolio and cataract consumables. Vision Care sales grew (+3% cc), driven by continued double-digit growth of Dailies Total1 . Operating loss was USD 112 million in the first nine months, compared to a loss of USD 12 million in prior year, impacted by the growth plan and impairment charges related to business development activities. Core operating income was USD 636 million (-7%, -2% cc). Core operating income margin in constant currencies decreased by 0.9 percentage points; currency had a negative impact of 0.5 percentage points, resulting in a net decrease of 1.4 percentage points to 14.3% of net sales. Key growth drivers Underpinning our financial results in the third quarter is a continued focus on key growth drivers, including Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade , Tasigna, Tafinlar + Mekinist, Jakavi , and Kisqali, as well as Biopharmaceuticals and Emerging Growth Markets. Growth Drivers Cosentyx (USD 556 million, +83% cc) continued its positive launch trajectory in the third quarter with strong growth in PsA, AS and PsO. Cosentyx has been used to treat more than 100,000 patients since launch. Entresto (USD 128 million, +138% cc) continued to grow, benefitting from the impact of improved access, sales force expansion in the US and broad reimbursement in Europe. Promacta/Revolade (USD 227 million, +36% cc) grew at a strong double-digit rate in all regions, driven by continued worldwide uptake as well as growth of the thrombopoietin class for chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Tasigna (USD 482 million, +12% cc) showed solid growth mainly driven by the US and phasing in Emerging Growth Markets . Tafinlar + Mekinist (USD 224 million, +27% cc) performance was driven by double-digit growth across all regions. Jakavi (USD 201 million, +31% cc) showed continued double-digit growth across all regions driven by myelofibrosis and reimbursement of the second-line polycythemia vera indication in additional countries. Gilenya (USD 801 million, 0% cc) was in line with prior year in the US, while Europe's solid growth was partly offset by phasing in Emerging Growth Markets. Kisqali (USD 26 million) CDK4/6 inhibitor launch progressed in the third quarter including EU approval. The full US promotional launch occurred at the end of August, and by the end of September, the vast majority of patient lives had payor access. Biopharmaceuticals (USD 292 million, +9% cc) grew mainly driven by Zarxio in the US and launches of Rixathon (rituximab) and Erelzi (etanercept) in the EU. Emerging Growth Markets Net sales in Emerging Growth Markets - which comprise all markets except the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand - grew (+5% USD, +8% cc) driven by China (+11% cc) and Russia (+23% cc). Strengthen R&D Innovation Review Benefitting from our continued focus on innovation, Novartis has one of the industry's most competitive pipelines with more than 200 projects in clinical development. Key developments from the third quarter of 2017 include: New approvals and regulatory opinions Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel, formerly CTL019) received the first ever FDA approval for a CAR-T cell therapy. Kymriah is indicated to treat children and young adults with B-cell ALL. Kisqali (ribociclib) received EU approval as a first-line option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with any aromatase inhibitor. Rydapt (midostaurin) was approved in the EU to treat newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and three types of advanced systemic mastocytosis. Alcon Clareon AutonoMe IOL was approved in the EU in October, with the most advanced optic material available in an automated, disposable and pre-loaded delivery system. AutonoMe IOL delivery system is easy, intuitive and enhances control for precise IOL insertion during cataract surgery. Regulatory submissions and filings AMG 334 (erenumab) filing was accepted by FDA, in the third quarter, for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraine days per month. Tasigna supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) was accepted by FDA and granted priority review. The sNDA seeks the addition of attempting Treatment-Free Remission (TFR) into the product label. Rixathon, Sandoz proposed biosimilar rituximab (Roche's Rituxan ¬Æ ) was accepted for regulatory review by FDA. Results from ongoing trials and other highlights ACZ885 (canakinumab) CANTOS phase III study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant 15% reduction of MACE in people with a prior heart attack and inflammatory atherosclerosis. A sub-group of study participants in the 150 mg arm, whose inflammation was reduced below the median hsCRP measured at three months after one dose of treatment, saw a 27% relative risk reduction on primary MACE end-point. The data was presented at the European Society of Cardiology and published in the NEJM. ACZ885 CANTOS phase III blinded, pre-planned oncology safety analyses revealed a 77% reduction in lung cancer mortality and 67% reduction in lung cancer cases, in the 300 mg arm. The data were published in The Lancet. Novartis is discussing the lung cancer findings with regulatory authorities and plans to begin evaluation in additional Phase III confirmatory studies. Cosentyx 5-year data was presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. These data showed high and long-lasting skin clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and demonstrated that the safety of this biologic was sustained over the 5-year treatment period. Tafinlar + Mekinist phase III adjuvant study data were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology. These data showed reduced risk of disease recurrence by 53% in patients with resected BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma and meaningful improvements in secondary endpoints, including overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival and freedom from relapse. In October, Tafinlar + Mekinist received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in adjuvant melanoma. Gilenya phase III PARADIGMS trial in children and adolescents showed significant reduction in relapses with MS versus interferon beta-1a. PARADIGMS is a first of its kind study in pediatric MS. Other current treatments have not been evaluated in head to head trials specifically designed for children and adolescents. AMG 334 (erenumab) new analysis presented at the International Headache Society demonstrated significantly reduced monthly migraine days in patients with chronic migraine who had failed previous preventive therapies. Additionally, a dedicated cardiovascular safety study re-affirmed placebo-like tolerability. Xolair confirmed re-treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria patients after treatment interruption, with 90% of patients regaining effective symptom control within 12 weeks of re-treatment. OPTIMA Phase IIIb data re-confirm that almost two thirds of patients treated with Xolair 300 mg for 6 months are well-controlled. Lucentis interim results from the head to head RIVAL study were presented at EURETINA and confirmed efficacy and durability vs. aflibercept in patients with nAMD. Five-year results from the Lucentis LUMINOUS study, demonstrate real-world efficacy and safety across five retinal diseases. Promacta/Revolade data showed long-term disease control for chronic/persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nearly 70% of patients maintained platelet counts of >=30√ó10 9 /L without rescue therapy for prolonged periods. More than one-third of patients permanently stopped one or more concomitant ITP medications. The data was published in Blood in October. Sandoz proposed biosimilar adalimumab (AbbVie's Humira ¬Æ ) matched the reference biologic in terms of efficacy and safety in a 51-week clinical study. The biosimilar is currently under review by EMA for the treatment of several immunological diseases. Create a stronger company for the future We continued to advance all of our productivity and quality programs in the third quarter: Novartis Business Services (NBS), our cross-divisional services organization, continues to deliver sustainable savings with a disciplined approach to investment while improving quality of services. In addition, we continue to optimize our geographical footprint to further strengthen capabilities in the five Novartis Global Service Centers. Novartis Technical Operations (NTO) continues to execute on its priorities of driving efficiency through manufacturing synergy, improved resource allocation and reduction of external spend. The integrated supply chain organization is improving customer service levels, worldwide product launch coordination and its agility to respond to near-term market variability. NTO is additionally reviewing logistics strategies to improve Novartis' overall competitiveness with a more efficient distribution network. Global Drug Development (GDD), implemented in 2016, oversees drug development across the innovative medicines and the biosimilars portfolio. The enterprise-wide approach to portfolio management is enabling better resource allocation and increased R&D productivity. Novartis continues to drive compliance, reliable product quality and sustainable efficiency as part of the quality strategy. A total of 161 global health authority inspections were completed in the first nine months of 2017 (54 in Q3), 25 of which were conducted by the FDA (7 in Q3 2017). All were deemed good or acceptable except for a Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade inspection at Alcon's plant in Puurs, Belgium which needs further responses before being closed out. Capital structure and net debt Retaining a good balance between investment in the business, a strong capital structure and attractive shareholder returns remains a priority. In January 2017, Novartis announced an up to USD 5 billion share buyback to be executed on the second trading line. During the first nine months of 2017, Novartis repurchased 47.0 million shares (USD 3.7 billion) under this buyback and 9.8 million shares (USD 0.8 billion) to mitigate dilution related to equity-based participation plans of associates. In addition, 2.8 million shares (USD 0.2 billion) were repurchased from associates, and 12.8 million treasury shares (USD 0.7 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of associates. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 46.8 million versus December 31, 2016. Novartis aims to offset the dilutive impact from equity-based participation plans of associates. These treasury share transactions resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 4.3 billion. As of September 30, 2017, the net debt increased by USD 4.7 billion to USD 20.7 billion versus December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly driven by the USD 6.5 billion annual dividend payment, net share repurchases and M&A related payments, partly offset by USD 8.0 billion free cash flow in the first nine months of 2017. The long-term credit rating for the company continues to be double-A (Moody's Investors Service Aa3; S&P Global Ratings AA-; Fitch Ratings AA). 2017 Outlook Barring unforeseen events We re-confirm our Group outlook as presented at the beginning of 2017. Group net sales in 2017 are expected to be broadly in line with the prior year (cc), after absorbing the impact of generic competition, including the continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the US and Europe. From a divisional perspective, we expect net sales performance (cc) in 2017 to be as follows: Innovative Medicines: revised upward to a slight increase Sandoz: revised downward to broadly in line with prior year to a slight decrease Alcon: low single digit growth Group core operating income in 2017 is expected to be broadly in line with prior year to a low single digit decline (cc). If mid-October exchange rates prevail for the remainder of 2017, the currency impact for the year would be negligible on net sales and negative 1 percentage point on core operating income. The estimated impact of exchange rates on our results is provided monthly on our website. Summary Financial Performance",

The exchange‚Äôs strategic plan to boost electronic trade by attracting more financial investors was attracting severe ire from many directions, and incentive schemes to promote the third Wednesday failed to create a subsequent pick-up in volumes. Several members even formed a breakaway group, nicknamed Project Leadenhall, to evaluate the possibility of setting up their own alternative trading platform. Fast forward to now, and things couldn‚Äôt be more different. The exchange is entering its annual LME Week in 2017 with more reasons to be cheerful than it has had for quite some time. For starters, the debate over fees has faded significantly, largely due to the further reduction in the cost of short-dated carries that took effect at the start of October. While the lower fees don‚Äôt satisfy every single... Email this article",

      "text": "By AI News On Oct 24, 2017 \n'The government is in no hurry to talk to the separatists and would like to approach the Kashmiri people directly through various other organisations.''Officials in charge of J&K affairs at the Centre are clear that there would be no let up in the operations against terrorists,' reveals BharatShakti.in founder Nitin A Gokhale. \nFormer Intelligence Bureau director Dineshwar Sharma's appointment as the interlocutor for a 'sustained' interaction and dialogue with stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir is a logical step forward in the Centre's outreach to the people of the state that began with Prime Minister Narendra D Modi's Independence Day declaration that 'Neither by bullet nor by abuses but only by an embrace we can solve the problem of Kashmir ( Na goli se na gali se baat banegi gale laga ne se ).' \nThe prime minister's declaration was followed up by Home Minister Rajnath Singh's four-day visit to J&K in September. \nSingh's extensive meetings with more than 80 delegations of various hues was confirmation of the Centre's intention to reach out to the awam (common people) in J&K. \nThe 'soft' approach comes on the back of a nearly year-long hard crackdown that the government was forced to order after the unrest in the wake of the killing of Hijbul Mujahideen 'commander' Burhan Wani in July 2016. \nHaving got the security situation under manageable control with a sustained and focused counter-insurgency, counter-terrorist (CI-CT) operations, the Centre, in consultation with J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, felt the time was right to make the conciliatory move. \nInitial reactions from the state are understandably cautious. The separatists have chosen not to comment so far perhaps because it is not clear yet if Sharma will reach out to them. \nThe government press note, announcing Sharma's appointment speaks of 'a dialogue with the elected representatives, various organisations and concerned individuals in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.' \nSharma will initiate a 'sustained interaction and dialogue to understand the legitimate aspirations of the wide cross sections of society, particularly the youth in Jammu and Kashmir and communicate them to the state government and the Centre, the press note added. \nQuestions have been raised about the cases initiated by the National Investigation Agency against some separatist leaders and whether those cases would prove to be an impediment in the reconciliation process. \nIndications are that the cases ‚Äî mostly related to terror and terror funding against specific individuals ‚Äî will continue even as we await clarity on the government's approach towards the Hurriyat leadership. \nMy sense is: The government is in no hurry to talk to the separatists and would like to approach the people directly through various other organisations. \nSimilarly, officials in charge of J&K affairs at the Centre are clear that there would be no let up in the pin-pointed, intelligence-based CI-CT operations against terrorists. \nA lot of hard work has gone into getting the security situation under control in the past year and there is no plan to ease the pressure, they contend. \nSharma, who retired as director, IB in December 2016, is known to be a low profile but effective official with wide-ranging experience in the security domain as well knowledgeable about the core concerns in J&K. \nHe was chosen over a host of political choices, mainly because Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval felt that a non-political person would have wider acceptance across the spectrum in J&K. \nA politically affiliated personality would, on the other hand, be restricted in his or her approach, the decision-makers felt. \nSharma, a 1979 batch IPS officer of the Kerala cadre, has worked closely with Doval and Rajnath Singh (when he was Uttar Pradesh chief minister) and has Prime Minister Modi's confidence. \nWith the rank of Cabinet Secretary, Sharma has been given the appropriate status and the requisite authority to deal with various government departments to initiate measures that would be required to signal the government's commitment towards development of Jammu and Kashmir. \nThe Centre has long felt that the development package for J&K worth Rs 80,060 crores (Rs 800.60 billion) announced by Prime Minister Modi in November 2015 needs a big push on the ground. \nWhile it is not clear if Sharma's mandate includes overseeing the implementation of the development assistance, his authority should ensure that government departments entrusted with releasing funds and completing promised projects would speed up delivery. \nIn all fairness though, Sharma's main task is to bridge the trust deficit that currently exists between the people and the state government in J&K. \nIn much the same manner as the government's approach towards the Naga issue ‚Äî where its interlocutor R N Ravi has spent a good part of three years in creating confidence and a sense of unity in a deeply divided society ‚Äî the Centre will be hoping that Sharma will be able to reach out to larger sections of the society in J&K. \nIn a way, his appointment will take some pressure off the beleaguered Mehbooba Mufti government and lend some heft to its legitimacy. \nThe government has rightly refrained from putting a timeframe and desisted from defining desired outcome at this stage. \nHowever, indications from within the government suggests that it is clear on one aspect: The new outreach is entirely internal to India and a third party (read Pakistan) will have no role whatsoever in the process. \nSharma is not the first interlocutor to be appointed by the Centre. \nSince 2001, three such attempts have been made with K C Pant, N N Vohra and a three-member panel of Dileep Padgaonkar, Radha Kumar and M M Ansari acting as interlocutors. None of those efforts were however taken to their logical conclusion. \nHopefully, Dineshwar Sharma will be able to break that jinx since the government has taken the decision from a position of strength and not compulsion under any pressure. \nIMAGE: Former Intelligence Bureau director Dineshwar Sharma, right, with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh after being appointed the Centre's representative in Jammu and Kashmir, October 23, 2017.

      "text": "Venice, 24 October 2017 - Italian Prime Minister, Paolo Gentiloni, accompanied by the Chairman of Eni, Emma Marcegaglia, and chief executive, Claudio Descalzi, today visited the company's biorefinery in Venice, the world's first example of the conversion of a traditional refinery into a refinery focused of the production of innovative biofuels, obtained through the proprietary Ecofining technology conceived and developed by Eni. \nDuring the visit, Eni top management highlighted how the conversion to a biorefinery, completed at the facility in Venice and underway at the plant in Gela, is a crucial element in the low-carbon transformation process that Eni is adopting for its activities. Total production of green-diesel will reach 1 million tonnes per year in 2020, with an overall investment of some ‚Ç¨500 million. The conversion of the Venice refinery, undertaken also to re-launch the business against a background of crisis for the sector, is one of the pillars of Eni's commitment for Italy. An historical commitment that is being renewed and based on development and innovation. In fact, for more than 80 years, Eni has continued to invest in this complex industry, generating development and employment. In the last five years, around 500 people, including ancillary staff, have worked at the Venice site \nOver the last three years Eni has spent ‚Ç¨15 billion in Italy, and over the coming four years has planned for further spending totalling some ‚Ç¨21 billion, of which 4 billion for industrial conversions, as a way to driving a process of profound transformation that will affect all sectors of the business, not only refining, but also the upstream sector and chemicals, power generation and site remediation. The aim is to breathe new life into existing assets with a low-carbon focus and to encourage a more efficient use of energy, without reducing employment, but investing in technology and skills and, thereby, pursuing a strategy, different from that of the rest of the sector, which has been cutting projects and dispersing human capital. \nEni's transformation process is based on people, skills and its capacity to innovate. From 2009 to 2016, Eni invested around ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in research, enabling the company to develop more than 300 proprietary technologies and over 6,000 patents. In the next four years, the company will invest over ‚Ç¨500 million, collaborating with leading Italian and international universities, such as MIT. In particular, for the conversion of its refineries, Eni has been able to leverage a unique proprietary technology, called Ecofining, for the production of high-quality biofuels. This lead to the creation of green-diesel, which can be added, without limit, to traditional diesel, allowing, in Eni's diesel pi√π Eni blend, a reduction in CO2 emissions of 7% and a cut in particulate emissions of up to 40%, while also improving engine efficiency.\n\nEni's transformation process has already produced significant results in terms of energy efficiency and the development of resources, enabling the company to be competitive and to continue to create long-term value. \nEni S.p.A. published this content on 24 October 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 24 October 2017 09:12:01 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.eni.com/en_IT/media/2017/10/eni-in-italy-4-billion-in-4-years-for-industrial-transformation-environmentally-focused-investment-and-technology \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/7BFE3CD35EFBA232580799708B5B02E05091D594",

(Photo by NOY MOSCOSO / INQURIER.net) \nGeorge San Mateo, president of the Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide (Piston), vehemently denied being a representative of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) on Tuesday, during a heated exchange with a newspaper columnist Herman ‚ÄúMentong‚Äù Tiu Laurel. \nThe debate started at the Pandesal Forum, a weekly event at the Kamuning Bakery Caf√© in Quezon City, when Laurel asked San Mateo if Piston was a political organization backed by progressive and left-leaning groups. \n‚ÄúNakakalungkot nga si Presidente [Rodrigo Duterte],‚Äù San Mateo told Laurel. ‚ÄúYung sinasabi niyang political group dahil sumuporta yung KMU [Kilusang Mayo Uno], eh nakipag-dialogue din naman siya dyan eh.‚Äù \nSan Mateo added, however, that he would still be willing to talk with the President to settle issues on the public utility vehicles (PUV) modernization program. \nBut Herman insisted on asking if San Mateo if he was representing NDFP. \n‚ÄúAno kinalaman nun? Namulitika siya eh ang isyu ay modernization?‚Äù San Mateo asked Herman. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a representative of the NDF here,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a representative of the CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines], nor the KMU nor Bayan. I‚Äôm representing Piston. Don‚Äôt say na kami ay nagde-destabilize. You‚Äôre way out of line.‚Äù \nSan Mateo even admitted voting for Duterte in the May 2016 elections as president because of his promises that he would revive the steel industry in the country, a promise that, he said, was later ‚Äúbroken.‚Äù \n‚ÄúKung makapagtayo tayo ng steel industry marami na tayo magagawa nun,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMakakagawa tayo ng sasakyan, yung agrikultura mamo-modernize natin. Kaya lang after a year wala na tayong narinig tungkol sa pangako nya.‚Äù \nIn a speech last week, Duterte tagged Piston, KMU and Karapatan as legal fronts of the CPP-New People‚Äôs Army after the militant groups supported Piston‚Äôs nationwide transport strike on Oct. 16 to 17. /atm Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

      "text": "0 2 [1] Constant currencies (cc), core results and free cash flow are non-IFRS measures. An explanation of non-IFRS measures can be found on page 44 of the Condensed Interim Financial Report. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates in this Release refer to same period in prior year. [2] The Alcon results of the third quarter partly benefit from stock in trade movements, contributing approximately 2% (cc) of growth. [3] Major Adverse Cardiac Events Alcon Strategic Review In early 2017, we announced a strategic review of the Alcon Division in order to explore all options to maximize value for our shareholders. We have made significant progress in our strategic review and have examined all options, ranging from retaining the business to IPO or a spin-off. As part of this, we have updated Alcon's strategic plan which confirms that it has the potential to grow sales at or above market while delivering profitability at least in line with the industry. We have also made significant progress on developing a potential capital markets solution, including financial carve-outs, tax and legal entity structuring, and identifying listing and incorporation locations. We believe the Q3 and YTD 2017 results indicate that the Alcon growth acceleration plan is beginning to generate growth, executed by a strong management team. In the near-term, Alcon will benefit from focusing on completing its turnaround in performance and leveraging the infrastructure and financial strength of Novartis. The strategic review also indicates that creating a stand-alone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. Key criteria for a final decision and timing are dependent on continued Alcon sales growth and margin improvement which need to be demonstrated for multiple quarters leading to potential action not likely before first half of 2019. Additionally, we have made the decision to move the Novartis Ophthalmic OTC products (2016 sales of USD 0.7 billion) to the Alcon Division effective January 1, 2018, where we believe the products will create most value, as they are complementary to the Alcon Vision Care business. At the same time this transfer will allow our Innovative Medicines Division to focus on delivering the exciting Novartis Rx product pipeline including RTH258. Our leading Ophthalmic prescription business (2016 sales of USD 4.8 billion) will remain with the Innovative Medicines Division. Basel, October 24, 2017 - Commenting on the results, Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis, said: \"Novartis became the first company to commercialize a CAR-T therapy, Kymriah , in Q3. Group s ales were solid, with growth in all divisions, and Alcon delivered strong growth in both sales and core operating income. We are on track to deliver our full year guidance, and have confidence in our growth phase.\" GROUP REVIEW Third quarter financials Net sales were USD 12.4 billion (+2%, +2% cc) in the third quarter, as volume growth of 7 percentage points, including growth from Cosentyx, Entresto and Alcon, was partly offset by the negative impacts of generic competition (-4 percentage points) and pricing (-1 percentage point). Operating income was USD 2.4 billion (+4%, +6% cc) mainly driven by growth drivers, productivity and a gain from a Swiss pension plan amendment, which were partly offset by generic erosion. Core adjustments amounted to USD 1.0 billion (2016: USD 1.1 billion). Net income was USD 2.1 billion (+7%, +10% cc), driven by the strong operating income and higher income from associated companies. EPS was USD 0.89 (+10%, +12% cc), driven by growth in net income and the benefit from the share buyback program. Core operating income was USD 3.4 billion (0%, +1% cc) as growth drivers and productivity offset generic erosion.

Sandoz net sales were USD 7.5 billion (-1%, -1% cc) in the first nine months, as volume growth of 6 percentage points was more than offset by 7 percentage points of price erosion. The US sales decline (-10% cc) was mostly offset by 4% (cc) growth in Europe and the rest of the world. Global Biopharmaceuticals grew 14% (cc). Operating income was USD 1.1 billion (-2%, -3% cc) mainly due to US pricing pressure and M&S growth investments, partly offset by sales growth in the rest of world and gross margin expansion.

Key growth drivers Underpinning our financial results in the third quarter is a continued focus on key growth drivers, including Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade , Tasigna, Tafinlar + Mekinist, Jakavi , and Kisqali, as well as Biopharmaceuticals and Emerging Growth Markets. Growth Drivers Cosentyx (USD 556 million, +83% cc) continued its positive launch trajectory in the third quarter with strong growth in PsA, AS and PsO. Cosentyx has been used to treat more than 100,000 patients since launch. Entresto (USD 128 million, +138% cc) continued to grow, benefitting from the impact of improved access, sales force expansion in the US and broad reimbursement in Europe. Promacta/Revolade (USD 227 million, +36% cc) grew at a strong double-digit rate in all regions, driven by continued worldwide uptake as well as growth of the thrombopoietin class for chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Tasigna (USD 482 million, +12% cc) showed solid growth mainly driven by the US and phasing in Emerging Growth Markets . Tafinlar + Mekinist (USD 224 million, +27% cc) performance was driven by double-digit growth across all regions. Jakavi (USD 201 million, +31% cc) showed continued double-digit growth across all regions driven by myelofibrosis and reimbursement of the second-line polycythemia vera indication in additional countries. Gilenya (USD 801 million, 0% cc) was in line with prior year in the US, while Europe's solid growth was partly offset by phasing in Emerging Growth Markets. Kisqali (USD 26 million) CDK4/6 inhibitor launch progressed in the third quarter including EU approval. The full US promotional launch occurred at the end of August, and by the end of September, the vast majority of patient lives had payor access. Biopharmaceuticals (USD 292 million, +9% cc) grew mainly driven by Zarxio in the US and launches of Rixathon (rituximab) and Erelzi (etanercept) in the EU. Emerging Growth Markets Net sales in Emerging Growth Markets - which comprise all markets except the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand - grew (+5% USD, +8% cc) driven by China (+11% cc) and Russia (+23% cc). Strengthen R&D Innovation Review Benefitting from our continued focus on innovation, Novartis has one of the industry's most competitive pipelines with more than 200 projects in clinical development. Key developments from the third quarter of 2017 include: New approvals and regulatory opinions Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel, formerly CTL019) received the first ever FDA approval for a CAR-T cell therapy. Kymriah is indicated to treat children and young adults with B-cell ALL. Kisqali (ribociclib) received EU approval as a first-line option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with any aromatase inhibitor. Rydapt (midostaurin) was approved in the EU to treat newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and three types of advanced systemic mastocytosis. Alcon Clareon AutonoMe IOL was approved in the EU in October, with the most advanced optic material available in an automated, disposable and pre-loaded delivery system. AutonoMe IOL delivery system is easy, intuitive and enhances control for precise IOL insertion during cataract surgery. Regulatory submissions and filings AMG 334 (erenumab) filing was accepted by FDA, in the third quarter, for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraine days per month. Tasigna supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) was accepted by FDA and granted priority review. The sNDA seeks the addition of attempting Treatment-Free Remission (TFR) into the product label. Rixathon, Sandoz proposed biosimilar rituximab (Roche's Rituxan ¬Æ ) was accepted for regulatory review by FDA. Results from ongoing trials and other highlights ACZ885 (canakinumab) CANTOS phase III study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant 15% reduction of MACE in people with a prior heart attack and inflammatory atherosclerosis. A sub-group of study participants in the 150 mg arm, whose inflammation was reduced below the median hsCRP measured at three months after one dose of treatment, saw a 27% relative risk reduction on primary MACE end-point. The data was presented at the European Society of Cardiology and published in the NEJM. ACZ885 CANTOS phase III blinded, pre-planned oncology safety analyses revealed a 77% reduction in lung cancer mortality and 67% reduction in lung cancer cases, in the 300 mg arm. The data were published in The Lancet. Novartis is discussing the lung cancer findings with regulatory authorities and plans to begin evaluation in additional Phase III confirmatory studies. Cosentyx 5-year data was presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. These data showed high and long-lasting skin clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and demonstrated that the safety of this biologic was sustained over the 5-year treatment period. Tafinlar + Mekinist phase III adjuvant study data were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology. These data showed reduced risk of disease recurrence by 53% in patients with resected BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma and meaningful improvements in secondary endpoints, including overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival and freedom from relapse. In October, Tafinlar + Mekinist received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in adjuvant melanoma. Gilenya phase III PARADIGMS trial in children and adolescents showed significant reduction in relapses with MS versus interferon beta-1a. PARADIGMS is a first of its kind study in pediatric MS. Other current treatments have not been evaluated in head to head trials specifically designed for children and adolescents. AMG 334 (erenumab) new analysis presented at the International Headache Society demonstrated significantly reduced monthly migraine days in patients with chronic migraine who had failed previous preventive therapies. Additionally, a dedicated cardiovascular safety study re-affirmed placebo-like tolerability. Xolair confirmed re-treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria patients after treatment interruption, with 90% of patients regaining effective symptom control within 12 weeks of re-treatment. OPTIMA Phase IIIb data re-confirm that almost two thirds of patients treated with Xolair 300 mg for 6 months are well-controlled. Lucentis interim results from the head to head RIVAL study were presented at EURETINA and confirmed efficacy and durability vs. aflibercept in patients with nAMD. Five-year results from the Lucentis LUMINOUS study, demonstrate real-world efficacy and safety across five retinal diseases. Promacta/Revolade data showed long-term disease control for chronic/persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nearly 70% of patients maintained platelet counts of >=30√ó10 9 /L without rescue therapy for prolonged periods. More than one-third of patients permanently stopped one or more concomitant ITP medications. The data was published in Blood in October. Sandoz proposed biosimilar adalimumab (AbbVie's Humira ¬Æ ) matched the reference biologic in terms of efficacy and safety in a 51-week clinical study. The biosimilar is currently under review by EMA for the treatment of several immunological diseases. Create a stronger company for the future We continued to advance all of our productivity and quality programs in the third quarter: Novartis Business Services (NBS), our cross-divisional services organization, continues to deliver sustainable savings with a disciplined approach to investment while improving quality of services. In addition, we continue to optimize our geographical footprint to further strengthen capabilities in the five Novartis Global Service Centers. Novartis Technical Operations (NTO) continues to execute on its priorities of driving efficiency through manufacturing synergy, improved resource allocation and reduction of external spend. The integrated supply chain organization is improving customer service levels, worldwide product launch coordination and its agility to respond to near-term market variability. NTO is additionally reviewing logistics strategies to improve Novartis' overall competitiveness with a more efficient distribution network. Global Drug Development (GDD), implemented in 2016, oversees drug development across the innovative medicines and the biosimilars portfolio. The enterprise-wide approach to portfolio management is enabling better resource allocation and increased R&D productivity. Novartis continues to drive compliance, reliable product quality and sustainable efficiency as part of the quality strategy. A total of 161 global health authority inspections were completed in the first nine months of 2017 (54 in Q3), 25 of which were conducted by the FDA (7 in Q3 2017). All were deemed good or acceptable except for a Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade inspection at Alcon's plant in Puurs, Belgium which needs further responses before being closed out. Capital structure and net debt Retaining a good balance between investment in the business, a strong capital structure and attractive shareholder returns remains a priority. In January 2017, Novartis announced an up to USD 5 billion share buyback to be executed on the second trading line. During the first nine months of 2017, Novartis repurchased 47.0 million shares (USD 3.7 billion) under this buyback and 9.8 million shares (USD 0.8 billion) to mitigate dilution related to equity-based participation plans of associates. In addition, 2.8 million shares (USD 0.2 billion) were repurchased from associates, and 12.8 million treasury shares (USD 0.7 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of associates. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 46.8 million versus December 31, 2016. Novartis aims to offset the dilutive impact from equity-based participation plans of associates. These treasury share transactions resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 4.3 billion. As of September 30, 2017, the net debt increased by USD 4.7 billion to USD 20.7 billion versus December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly driven by the USD 6.5 billion annual dividend payment, net share repurchases and M&A related payments, partly offset by USD 8.0 billion free cash flow in the first nine months of 2017. The long-term credit rating for the company continues to be double-A (Moody's Investors Service Aa3; S&P Global Ratings AA-; Fitch Ratings AA). 2017 Outlook Barring unforeseen events We re-confirm our Group outlook as presented at the beginning of 2017. Group net sales in 2017 are expected to be broadly in line with the prior year (cc), after absorbing the impact of generic competition, including the continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the US and Europe. From a divisional perspective, we expect net sales performance (cc) in 2017 to be as follows: Innovative Medicines: revised upward to a slight increase Sandoz: revised downward to broadly in line with prior year to a slight decrease Alcon: low single digit growth Group core operating income in 2017 is expected to be broadly in line with prior year to a low single digit decline (cc). If mid-October exchange rates prevail for the remainder of 2017, the currency impact for the year would be negligible on net sales and negative 1 percentage point on core operating income. The estimated impact of exchange rates on our results is provided monthly on our website. Summary Financial Performance",
