      "text": "Opportunities for a new era in manufacturing By MM 23 October 2017 Editorial \nA new industry-led report into Australia’s manufacturing sector has highlighted the opportunity for all firms to move towards advanced manufacturing by adopting more sophisticated business models and production techniques, according to a media release by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. \nCiting the report Advanced manufacturing: a new definition for a new era , released by the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, Acting Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash said, “Manufacturing has played a major role in contributing to Australia’s stellar economic performance over the past 25 years.” \n“However in order for Australian manufacturing to continue to succeed domestically and globally, it must evolve and diversify.” \n“Today’s report emphasises that the continued growth of the sector is dependent upon manufacturers innovating, moving up the value chain and embracing production efficiencies in order to develop new products and serve new markets,” Cash said. \nThe Federal Government recently announced the $47.5 million Advanced Manufacturing Growth Fund, which is designed to support investment in advanced manufacturing projects in Victoria and South Australia as part of the $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund, announced in the 2017-18 Budget. \nOther measures include the Entrepreneurs’ Program and the Research and Development Tax Incentive, which enables individual companies to invest in research and development, and provide advice and assistance to develop and commercialise new ideas and products. \nThe Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre is part of the Government’s Industry Growth Centres initiative, which is designed to improve the productivity, competitiveness and innovative capacity of industry sectors of strategic priority in the Australian economy.

      "text": "Exhibitions a driver for growth and global trade By cim / October 24,   Exhibitions a driver for growth and global trade \nThe Association of Australian Convention Bureaux’s (AACB) latest analysis of international bids won, lost and in the pipeline shows the importance of exhibitions, with an estimated 125,000 international and 74,000 domestic delegates and potential buyers heading to Australia. Print AACB says exhibitions play a significant role in Australia’s economic growth \nAACB’s members secured 154 international business events that include an exhibition on the forward calendar, with a further 75 yet to confirm their exhibition requirements. The 68th International Astronautical Congress held in Adelaide brought new trade and business opportunities. \n“International exhibitions play a significant role in enabling global trade and stimulating Australia’s economy,” said Andrew Hiebl, CEO of the AACB. “They offer a platform for Australian small to medium enterprises to promote their goods and services to export markets on home soil. \n“Almost half of the international association conventions won have a confirmed exhibition. Without the strategic bidding activities of convention bureaux, these opportunities would simply not occur in Australia.” MCEC hosted the World Conference on Carbon 2017. \nThe top five industry sectors attracted for international business events are Healthcare and Social Assistance (1 in 4); Professional, Scientific and Technical Services (1 in 5); Information, Media and Telecommunications (1 in 10); Financial and Insurance Services (1 in 20); and Administrative and Support Services (1 in 20). \n“Business events enable opportunities for commercialisation by bringing together scientists and researchers with private enterprise and investors. Resulting new products and services then increase national productivity,” said Karen Bolinger, AACB’s president. \n“For many professions, exhibitions are a key sales tool, and in some instances, they are the primary marketing activity. As such, their value to cities that exert new technology cannot be underestimated.” The International Conference on Machine Learning was held at ICC Sydney in 2017. \nIn the last few months, significant international exhibitions accompanied conventions such as the 68th International Astronautical Congress (Adelaide), The World Conference on Carbon 2017 (Melbourne), and The International Conference on Machine Learning (Sydney). \nHiebl said that the losses are still a concern, however, the bid pipeline shows tremendous opportunity. \n“Unfortunately, Australia is still missing out on this significant opportunity for connecting with global industries,” he said. “Through these international bid losses, 94 exhibitions will now be held in countries other than Australia, putting access to basic trade opportunities out of reach for many Australian SMEs. \n“However, convention bureaux around the country continue to work with their industry partners on opportunities that remain in the bid pipeline, including up to 125 bids in play with exhibitions that present the potential for international trade.”",

      "text": "Power bills set to soar almost $2000 over next decade 24th Oct 2017 7:25 AM Use this content by The Australian \nHOUSEHOLD power bills would soar almost $200 per year for a decade under federal Labor's plan for a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. \nThat's according to modelling commissioned by the Climate Change Authority, which also showed almost all of Australia's 16 coal-fired power stations would have to close to meet the party's target. \nIt's the first indication of the costs of federal Labor's energy policy, and comes as the Turnbull Government urges state premiers to support its recently announced National Energy Guarantee. \nThe Australian reports the CCA modelling showed household energy bills would increase by $1921 over 10 years from 2020 to 2030 if an emissions intensity scheme was introduced that aimed to achieve a 52 per cent renewable energy target. \nThat's the closest model to Labor's target yet. The power station in Mannering Park will be the next to come offline after Liddell. Once it closes, the land will be used for a $30m solar farm. Picture: AAP \nIt showed the annual rise in electricity bills would start at about $100 a year in 2020 and peak at $285 a year in 2027. \nThe modelling, which was initially provided to the government in a briefing note on the Climate Change Authority's 2016 report on Policy Options for Australia's Electricity Supply Sector, also showed Australia would need to cut about 17,000 megawatts of black and brown coal-fired power generation out of the market by 2030. \nAccording to The Australian that would mean closing all but one or two of Australia's coal-fired power plants. \nEnergy Minister Josh Frydenberg told the publication the CCA modelling exposed Labor's \"hypocrisy\" over energy policy. All but one or two of Australia’s coal-fired power stations would be closed in favour of renewable energy sources under the plan. Picture: Tom Huntley \nHe accused the party, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. \n\"The only reason why Labor hasn't modelled its emission intensity scheme is because it will drive up household bills by an average of almost $200 per year,\" Mr Frydenberg told The Australian. \n\"That's more than a $300-a-year difference to the Turnbull government's National Energy Guarantee, which will deliver affordable and reliable power. \n\"A family in Newcastle who are already paying $1500 a year for their power cannot afford a $200 increase in their bill. Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg has accused Labor, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. Picture Kym Smith \n\"Labor has been calling for a bipartisan national policy based on expert advice. \n\"Now this is on the table this is a test of Bill Shorten's mettle. \n\"This is his chance to put aside the climate wars of the past.\" \nModelling for the Coalition's NEG shows it would likely cut average household power bills by up to $115 per year over a decade to 2030. \nThe federal government will put its NEG plan before state premiers at a Coalition of Australian Governments meeting next month. \nPremiers must sign off on the plan for it to go ahead. \nAhead of the meeting, Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott yesterday sent letters to the premiers urging them to support the plan.

      "text": "Our pollies are hooked on pokies premium_icon by Paul Williams \nI ENJOYED morning tea with my family at a large Brisbane sports club on Sunday. As I wandered around to check the facilities I found myself in a maze of machines bathed in the warm, alluring light of a gambler's paradise. It was 10.30am but there were already dozens of punters - many with grog in hand - ploughing notes into machines like paper towels into a shredder. I could only think of Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie's bombshell allegations against a major casino last Wednesday. Wilkie's accusation that the casino had illegally tampered with machines could well be the turning point anti-pokie activists have been waiting for. Pokie King Peter Liston: Peter Liston plays poker machines for business. Australian Federal Police are \"evaluating\" the claims as Wilkie marshals support for an inquiry, with the backing of Nick Xenophon, as well as the Greens and Jacqui Lambie. Sadly, the major parties have handballed the issue, insisting pokie regulation is up to state governments. How convenient. While that may be true on constitutional paper, there are examples of state and federal cooperation when Australians' national welfare is at risk. Gun control, school and hospital funding, and the battle against ice addiction are just a few. Indeed, the parallels between drug and gambling addiction are clear, and it's morally reprehensible for any political party to wash its hands of any scourge that's destroying families. Shockingly, Australia's 200,000 poker machines means we have more one-armed bandits per capita than any country in the world. That's one for every 114 people. Australians put about $130 billion into pokies each year, and lose $11 billion overall. That equates to more than $2000 per player - the highest rate in the world, and 10 times what Americans lose. And Queensland's up there with the worst. In July this year alone, Queenslanders notched up a new record in losing more than $215 million - or almost $5000 each minute - on pokies. That's an annual loss of $2.25 billion. Cruelly, we know the burden of those losses is not shared equally. Economically disadvantaged areas are hit hardest. Brisbane punters lose about $60,000 per machine per year while Logan players lose about $80,000. So the pokie industry is propped up by those least able to afford it. Andrew Wilkie’s accusation that a casino had illegally tampered with machines could well be the turning point anti-pokie activists have been waiting for. Picture: Gary Ramage Worse still, most profits come from those least able to control their behaviour, with 60 per cent of all pokie losses borne by \"problem gamblers\". On high-intensity machines with fast-turning games and high-stake bets, it's possible to lose $1500 per hour. It's sickening to think what an addict, possibly numbed by drink, can do to a household budget - not to mention a mortgage, marriage and kids - in just a few zombied hours. But it shouldn't surprise us that state governments, often described as the biggest pokie addicts, won't consider bans. With Queensland alone raking in $687 million in gambling taxes in 2016-17, and up to $718 million next year, the states need pokie revenue like a junkie needs a fix. The State Government says it takes gambling addiction \"seriously\", and that's why there are caps on pokie numbers. But the state also spends just $5.5 million on problem gambler treatment - or less than 1 per cent of its pokie tax revenue. And yet I already hear the protests of the powerful pokie lobby - the same force that's killed off previous attempts to mandate player pre-commitments and maximum dollar bets. \"Say no to the nanny state,\" they say. \"Real Aussies love a bet, so let them make their own decisions.\" It's as predictable as it is false. Poker machines affect the brain's dopamine-making abilities differently from any other gambling form. The bright lights and exciting sounds \"reward\" punters, while near-misses convince players the \"big win\" is just around the corner. Indeed, the changes in brain chemistry have been likened to cocaine addiction. That's why addicted gamblers can't make rational decisions over their behaviour. It's not only OK for governments to crack down on dangerous industries, it's obligatory. The duty of any government is to protect its most vulnerable people - even from themselves. Will the coming election prompt Queensland's Labor and LNP parties to outline how they'll address pokie addiction in the next term? Don't bet on it.

      "text": "Strategists aren't greeting gains in the ASX with joy. Peter Braig by Sarah Turner Rather than celebrating the ASX's recent solid year-long run, strategists have started to seriously question whether it will continue.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index has climbed 9 per cent in 12 months, and while this pales beside the gains recorded in some global equity markets, it's a solid performance for the Australian market. When dividends are included, shareholders of the broad index have enjoyed returns of 15 per cent.\nThe ASX advance has been made in an environment that's been \"kind to risk assets\" , Deutsche Bank Australian equity strategist Tim Baker said.\n\"Global growth has accelerated while subdued inflation has kept policy tightening at bay. Valuations are high, and volatility is low, both globally and in Australia,\" Mr Baker said.\nBut this environment is set to turn, Mr Baker believes, with policy uncertainty \"quite high\" and central banks set to try to get monetary policy back to more normal settings.\n He questioned whether the ASX could now enter into a period of prolonged losses, or a \"bear market\", given the expected change of backdrop.\nAfter looking across a range of indicators which acted as warning signals in the past he said \"overall, the data suggests that the odds of a bear market in Australia in the next six months are low.\"\nHowever, Goldman Sachs' Australian equity strategist Matthew Ross is cautious about the Australian equity market, despite the bourse's recent powerful run.\nStretched valuations and softening earnings momentum mean the outlook for the market appears challenged, Mr Ross said.\nMore worryingly, the prospect of interest rate hikes has increased in line with brightening prospects for the economy and waning disinflationary forces.\nMr Ross has recently held meetings with investors, where the debate was all about how to defensively position in a dislocated market.\n\"Positioning for a pullback has historically been very simple,\" Mr Ross said, with \"low risk\" stocks significantly outperforming in each of the largest market corrections over the past 25 years.\nHowever, \" given the distortions of unprecedented central bank actions , we doubt this pattern will repeat.\"\nValuations for defensive stocks were a lot more accommodative in prior periods of market weakness and also they're unlikely to get a tailwind from central banks lowering interest rates this time around as most central banks are already at record lows with rates.\nExpensive, highly-leveraged \"defensive\" firms will likely come under pressure in a market downturn for the first time since Mr Ross and colleagues have been collecting data, he noted.\nOptions for investors going forward in this environment include finding a new slew of \"low risk\" stocks and hedging with banks and miners, he suggests.\nBut Mr Baker at Deutsche Bank said that, while valuations are above average on a forward price to earnings basis, Deutsche Bank's fair value model indicates that's justified, he said.\nIn addition, valuations have been \"fairly stable\" over the past six months instead of rising as they have tended to do when approaching bear markets in the past, according to Mr Baker.\nEarnings growth is still holding up, interest rates are low and stable and market leadership is not yet a concern with small caps and value only just beginning to outperform.\n\"Yield curves remain positive, investors are not flocking to safe-haven commodities, the US dollar has fallen and volatility is not picking up,\" Mr Baker said.\n\"We continue to see the S&P/ASX200 at 5900 by year-end and 6000 by June 2018,\" he said. In contrast, Mr Ross's 12-month target for the benchmark measure is 5800 points.",

      "text": "Why the Kangaroos are the Death Star premium_icon by Nick Campton \nIN the grand scheme of things, whenever Australia lose it's good for international rugby league. \nThe Kangaroos are the colossus of Test football. In the last 10 years they've lost to New Zealand five times, drew with them once and beaten everybody else they've played, accumulating a 39-5-1 record against all opposition. \nSince Great Britain beat Australia 23-12 in the 2006 Tri Nations, the closest the Poms have come to beating the Kangaroos was a 16-12 defeat in the 2014 Four Nations. In the 21st century, Great Britain/England have three wins against Australia from 24 attempts. \nFrance are the only other team to have ever beaten Australia and the last time they did that was in 1978. The French lost 52-30 to Australia in 2004 and that match is the closest any tier two nation has come to beating Australia in the last 20 years. \nTEAMS: Who will play in week one? \nThe Kangaroos deserve a lot of credit for their continued supremacy, especially over the last 18 months after it looked like New Zealand had well and truly overtaken them in 2014-15. \nBut Australia, as good as they may be, are the schoolyard bullies. They're the big men on campus, the unstoppable force, the Death Star, the favourites in every game they play and every game they have played in the last 20 years. \nThey're the prohibitive favourites for this World Cup and it would take something truly shocking for anyone else to get the prize. But if someone else did, if New Zealand or England or Tonga could somehow claw their way past the green and gold juggernaut, it would give international rugby league a serious shot in the arm. \nIt's no coincidence that New Zealand's 24-0 thumping in the 2005 Tri Nations final was followed by victories in the 2008 World Cup, the 2010 Four Nations and the 2014 Four Nations. No one Kiwi player appeared in all four matches, it was a true generational shift. Australia romped to victory in the 2013 World Cup. \nAnother New Zealand win would be a boost, but an England World Cup win could be one of the greatest moments in that country's rugby league history. \nRugby league in England is in a tough spot. It has the history and the tradition and the fanatical support in the north but the clubs are perennially short of cash and the struggle to move beyond the game's birthplace has been tough. \nThe Test side hasn't won a tournament since 1972 and even then it was on a count back. They haven't made a World Cup final since 1995. It has been a tough few decades for the Lions, first as Great Britain and then as England. \nA win would give the game in the UK some much needed wider exposure and provide success-starved England sports fans some desperately needed glory. It would be the kind of win the fans would remember for the rest of their lives. \nNew Zealand footy people will talk about the 2008 World Cup final for as long as the game is played. The haka before the match, Billy Slater's gaffe that lead to Benji Marshall's try, the decisive penalty try to Lance Hohaia, the match-sealing score to Adam Blair, the scenes afterwards - they're iconic images of New Zealand rugby league. Australia are again the warm favourites. \nAnd if Tonga somehow, someway, manage to win it all? Forget about it. \nIt would be the greatest day in international rugby league history. Jason Taumalolo would become an all-time footballing legend. They would rename islands after him. \nIf Australia win, and they probably will, its just one more tournament victory. \nAnother win among many. Special and unique in its own way without a doubt, but without the singular significance of an England or New Zealand victory. \nThat's not to denigrate the achievements of the Kangaroos by any means. \nThe team that romped to victory in the 2013 tournament was among the finest ever to leave these shores. This time around there's a truly fascinating mix of the old guard and the new generation - Mal Meninga's squad has a fun mix of grizzled veterans and hungry youngsters. \nThe likes of Cameron Munster, Michael Morgan and Tom Trbojevic making their mark on the Test arena is a recipe for a good time and the return of Billy Slater promises to be a treat. Most of the Kangaroos recent losses have come without Johnathan Thurston. \nThis will also be the final time we see Slater, Cameron Smith and Cooper Cronk all play together, a gift many fans won't appreciate until its over. \nAustralia will play some brilliant football on their way to a probable victory, and no matter the result they'll be appointment viewing because they are the best in the world. \nBut things are better for Test footy when they lose. Mal Meninga is one of Test football's champions, a true believer in the importance of the international game. \nIronically, the best thing he could do for Test footy would be to fail.",

(Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images) by Exclusive: Dean Ritchie \nPARRAMATTA has ended its flirtation with Kangaroos halfback Cooper Cronk. \nEels CEO Bernie Gurr revealed on Tuesday morning his club would not be pursuing off-contract Cronk. \nThe chase for Cronk is now down to two clubs - the Roosters and Sharks. \n\"We're not in the race for Cooper Cronk,\" Gurr said. \n\"We assess every player that comes onto the open market, to see whether they fit our club, fit our salary cap and fit our positional needs. \n\"When we looked at our roster and our positional needs we have opted to go in another direction.\" \nGurr said his club never engaged in \"serious discussions\" with Cronk's management. \nParramatta claim to be more than happy with their existing halves pairing of Corey Norman and Mitch Moses. \nThe Roosters remain favourites to sign Cronk.

Fedpol. Photo: Andrew Meares  Photo: Andrew Meares And two weeks after those hearings, the court will rule on Friday at 2.15pm on Mr Joyce's fate, and that of six senators: Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash, former Nationals cabinet minister Matt Canavan, former Greens senators Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam, One Nation's Malcolm Roberts and NXT leader Nick Xenophon.\nIf a byelection is ordered in Mr Joyce's northern NSW seat of New England, the earliest the poll can be held is December 2.\nAs the only lower house MP, and with the Turnbull government holding just 76 seats in the 150-member lower house, it is Mr Joyce's case the government is most concerned about, although independent MP Cathy McGowan said on Tuesday that she would continue to support the government, which gives the Coalition some breathing room.\nFairfax Media spoke to half a dozen Nationals MPs on Tuesday and the prevailing view was that Mr Joyce, who referred himself to the Court in August when he learnt he was a New Zealander by descent through his father James, is that a byelection is increasingly likely.\nAdvertisement \"That fact that it has taken so long for the court to make its ruling doesn't bode well,\" one MP, who asked not to be named, said, \"and all sorts of theories are sweeping the place.\"\n\"Let's get through to Friday and see what happens,\" said another MP. \"The fact it has taken two weeks is a worry. Confidence has been eaten away as the days have gone by.\"\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly said that, based on the advice of the Solicitor-General, \"We are very, very confident that our members who have been caught up in this will be held by the court to be eligible to sit in the Parliament and therefore eligible to be ministers.\"\nB ut another Nationals source said that the two-week delay in the ruling could favour Mr Joyce as a \"black letter law\" decision against the Nationals leader would likely have been made quickly.\nWhile confidence is falling in government ranks that the court will rule favourably for Mr Joyce, to a person Nationals MPs believe Mr Joyce would win a byelection that could feature a Melbourne Cup field of candidates from Labor, One Nation, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, and possibly former New England independent and political foe Tony Windsor.\nIf Mr Joyce loses his seat, Nationals Senate leader Nigel Scullion is the next in line to take over by dint of seniority, even though he is in the upper house and the Coalition will likely face at least one sitting week without Mr Joyce as lower house leader.\nInfrastructure Minister Darren Chester and Small Business Minister Michael McCormack are both seen as future leaders of the Nationals and are in the lower house.\nABC psephologist Antony Green told Fairfax Media that December 2 was the most likely date should a byelection be ordered, but December 9 was possible if a Queensland state election was called for November 25.",

      "text": "Latest figures released on overseas travel emergencies 24 Oct 2017 \nForeign Minister Julie Bishop has urged all Australians who travel overseas to ensure they are fully insured for medical emergencies and sickness when abroad. \nIn 2016-17, Australia’s consular officers around the world helped more than 12,000 nationals in trouble overseas, in cases that included 1,701 hospitalisations and 1,653 deaths. \nThere were also 1,642 arrests overseas, 2,546 whereabouts inquiries, 3,081 welfare cases, and 1,090 victims of crime. \nMore than 10 million departures from Australia were recorded in 2016-17. \n“With so many Australians travelling, things can go wrong including robbery, injury, assault and arrest,” Ms Bishop said. \n“However, there are limits to the assistance the Government can provide. \n“Australians who choose to travel overseas should be as prepared and self-reliant as possible. Appropriate insurance is essential. If you can’t afford travel insurance, you can’t afford to travel. \n“Uninsured travellers who are hospitalised overseas or need medical evacuation can face crippling medical bills. Medicare and the Government will not cover those expenses.” \nEarly in October, the Minister launched the 2016-17 Consular State of Play – a statistical snapshot of consular assistance provided to Australians abroad by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). \nIt showed that Australian residents took 10,039,700 trips during that financial year, having grown about five per cent annually over the past five years. \nWhile only one in one thousand Australians who are overseas at any given time during a year need the Australian Government’s assistance with problems, priority is given to cases involving particularly vulnerable Australians such as children, the mentally impaired, and victims of assault (including sexual assault). \nThe destinations where Australian travellers have received consular help the most are New Zealand, Indonesia, USA, the UK, Thailand, China, Singapore, Japan, Fiji and India. \nThe 30-39 year-old age group received the most help (18 per cent of cases), followed by 40-49 year-olds and 50-59 year-olds (17 per cent each), 20-29 year-olds (15 per cent), 60-69 year-olds (12 per cent), and 10-19 year-olds (8 per cent). \nChildren up to nine years old who received help accounted for eight per cent of cases, while the 70+ age group accounted for five per cent. \nAccording to the 2017 Australian Travel Insurance Behaviour survey (commissioned by DFAT and Understand Insurance and released at the same time as the Consular State of Play) , 48 per cent of recent cruise ship travellers bought the wrong kind of insurance for their travel. \n“Travellers need to choose the right insurance for their trip. Many travellers mistakenly believe their insurance provides appropriate cover,” Ms Bishop said. \n“I urge all Australians planning overseas travel to visit the Smartraveller website for advice and to read the Consular Services Charter , which explains what services the Government can provide if assistance is required while overseas.” \nThe Consular State of Play 2016-17 can be found at: http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-services/consular-services/Pages/consular-state-of-play-2016-17.aspx . \nCHRIS JOHNSON",

Port Adelaide's ambitious play to the Asian nation will continue when it once again faces the Gold Coast Suns in Shanghai. The ground has been christened as Adelaide Arena at Jiangwan Stadium, with the match to be played in Round 9 on the afternoon of Saturday, May 19. This season, the Power thumped the Suns by 72 points in front of 10,118 fans in Shanghai. The Power want to increase ticketing for 2018's match to 13,000. Both teams were given an early bye after the fixture to compensate for the long-distance travel. Gold Coast has been forced to relocate several of its home games due to the 2018 Commonwealth Games being held in the city. The Suns will not be able to play at Metricon Stadium until early June, but will play seven home games there after their return. Gold Coast will face North Melbourne at Cairns' Cazalys Stadium in Round 1.

      "text": "ASBEC touts less focus on BCR, national guidelines in push for better business cases \nBy Patrick Lau, Monday 23 October 2017 The peak body for sustainable construction has called for better business case practices in Australian infrastructure, pointing out a culture of haphazard planning and communication. \nPoor planning and communication hamper Australian infrastructure, according to ASBEC The Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council (ASBEC), in a recent whitepaper titled \"Bang for Buck: Delivering better business cases to realise more value from our infrastructure investments\" , has collated the findings from a series of roundtable discussions with decision makers across government, industry and agencies connected to infrastructure planning and development. The results revealed a lack of coordination, mismanagement of data, and inconsistency of purpose when it comes to building business cases for infrastructure projects. ASBEC noted that many of its findings \"will be familiar to infrastructure policy and decision makers\". Chief among the areas of challenge that ASBEC reports are leadership, decision-making, understanding of methodology, and public engagement. However, \"Bang for Buck\" also includes specific recommendations to improve processes and outcomes. These solutions are largely at national and federal level, to integrate better practices across a sector plagued by miscommunication and cross-purposes. Vision and leadership are lacking in the arena of business case development, although ASBEC argues this is partially the fault of a lack of overarching policy. The whitepaper calls for \"a shared integrated vision for our cities and communities\" and \"clear indicators… [to] provide an anchor for business case development\". In terms of decision-making, treasuries are singled out for \"short-termism\" and \"a focus on reducing costs\"; while business cases for social infrastructure are impeded by the dominant transport infrastructure paradigm. In general, says ASBEC, the infrastructure industry focuses on project delivery rather than success or improvement, often failing to evaluate or actuate benefits. In response, it calls for statutorily independent agencies to review and report on business cases, while Infrastructure Australia should be handed responsibility for developing guidelines for business case development. All public stakeholders \"should embed project evaluation and benefit realisation within decision making processes, as a condition of funding and as a core component of project scoping\". But possibly the most damning criticism is saved for the section on method and \"madness\". The indictment of the Australian infrastructure sector's business case methodology is gleaned from ASBEC's discussions with industry and government leaders, and comes with the stamp of inside knowledge. According to these voices of authority, infrastructure business case development in Australia is a shambolic and amateurish process. A litany of sector failures is outlined. Guidelines are nonexistent or \"inconsistently applied across jurisdictions\"; costing and valuing risks is done wilfully rather than deliberately; discount rates are misunderstood or inflated. Externalities values are tied to international datasets, and other metrics differ arbitrarily between bodies and localities. Options analysis and whole-of-life costing are limited, and a \"reliance on benefit-cost ratios (BCR) creates a pass/fail culture for decision-makers that in and of itself motivates the delivery of a business case above a benefit-cost ratio of ‘1'\". \nThe proposed solution largely involves beefing up Infrastructure Australia through increased resources and responsibilities. The development of guidelines, including standardised metrics, and oversight of a national ‘community of practice' involving infrastructure stakeholders (\"treasuries, line agencies and infrastructure delivery bodies\"). The whitepaper also covers poor public engagement, noting that media reports often uncritically report BCR as the sum total of a business case. This comes at the expense of investigating the compromises made to reach a positive BCR, or the complexities of the business case surrounding it. In response, it argues: \"Business cases should support narratives for infrastructure decisions that communicate benefits\". Framing them within broader policy vision, and supporting them with intelligent and intelligible data, will push benefits to the forefront of public consciousness. \nWhile the proposals in \"Bang for Buck\" are extensive, it seems ASBEC is both serious and realistic about advancing them. The report implies forthcoming discussions with Australian parliaments and infrastructure agencies - and concludes by calling for the support of industry to bring weight to the issue. With several high-profile instances of contention in recent years - the NBN and various energy projects perhaps chief among them - it appears business cases for infrastructure are increasingly subject to scrutiny in the newsroom, parliaments and pubs alike. Standards of communication that go beyond BCR can only be a good thing, for the sake of informed debate if nothing else. LISTED UNDER TAG :",

Tierney Bourke Contributed GLA231017AFL \nNext on the agenda is Capricornia regions Sun's Academy testing day in November. \nThey have been identified throughout the year as players of interest to attend the testing to gain selection into the Gold Coast Sun's Talent Academy for the 2018 season. \nThe three-day carnival consisted of teams from Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast, as well as Northern Rivers and Darling Downs. \nKookaburras consisted of players from Capricornia, Mackay, Townsville, Cairns and Cape York and despite only meeting each other at the airport, the team had two wins and a draw out of the six games played. Tierney with Traub Contributed GLA231017AFL \nThe team was coached by Brisbane Lions player Sabrina Frederick-Traub who passed on valuable techniques in playing and training. \n\"It was amazing to have Sabrina as our coach because she showed me new skills and training techniques which has made me a better player,” Tierney said. \n\"She congratulated us on our wins and praised us in all of our games.” \nTierney, who played as a ruck rover, scored the first goal in the first game against Northern Rivers in a 16-point loss and she added that she loved the experience. \n\"I was very pleased with how I played and I was so excited to get the first goal for the Kookaburras,” Tierney said. \n\"I was the youngest and second smallest in the team and everyone played really well together. Kiera O'Connor Contributed GLA231017AFL \n\"The training and bonding sessions were fun.” \nCountry Queensland rebounded after a 14-point loss to Gold Coast Sunsets to roll Brisbane North Brumbies by 10 points. \nThe team finished with a draw against Darling Downs Demons. Tierney Contributed GLA231017AFL \nTierney began at Gladstone Mudcrabs and follows both Richmond and Sydney Swans. \n\"My favourite players are Buddy Franklin from Sydney Swans and Patrick Dangerfield from Geelong Cats and Kiera and I would love to play professional AFL,” Tierney said.",

      "text": "WIN a Beautiful Designer Beach Shade from Hollie and Harrie \nHollie and Harrie is AUSTRALIA’S PREMIER AND ORIGINAL DESIGNER BEACH SHADE /SOMBRILLA \nLong time friends and founders, Skye Hollingsworth (Hollie) & Claire Harris (Harrie) from Melbourne Australia are joined together by a love of the sunny outdoors and family life. \nWe adore the beach and outdoors but dread the sunburn. We are very ‘sun smart’ but find the existing beach tents on the market too stifling, provide no natural air flow and our children do not enjoy sitting in them. \nAnd so we designed the Sombrilla as our first product. Stylish and extremely practical, children love playing (and adults love to relax!) under the shade provided by the Sombrilla and 95% UV protection will give you added peace of mind. OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA \nSince release of the Sombrilla sales both locally in Australia and internationally (USA, Europe and New Zealand) have increased each year with many sales to existing satisfied customers and the Sombrilla is now a common sight on many beaches around the world . \nIn Feb 2017 Hollie & Harrie was purchased by Australia’s largest importer and wholesaler of Beach Shade and Beach furniture –“The Beachkit Group” \nElegant & sophisticated, the Sombrilla is made from 100% cotton, so breathe & relax while enjoying superior sun protection. With optional configurations for high-sun and low-sun you’ll need to pack a picnic. You can now indulge in those long summer days at the beach blissfully unaware of the heat as you enjoy yourself under a cool canopy of natural shade. \nSince 2010 this is the Original and Best Australian Designer Beach Shade – our competitors have come and gone but they all initially buy our product to try and match our design and quality. \nRaw unbleached material, combined with silk screen printing gives each Sombrilla individual character. Slight variations in the print means you can be sure you have an original Hollie & Harrie beach shade. \nThanks to our friends at Hollie and Harrie we have 2 beautiful Sombrillas to GIVE AWAY to 2 of our lucky readers. If you or someone you know would love the chance to WIN one of these, simply enter your details below and good luck x",

Photo: JUDE KEOGH 1024jkfield2 \nIt’s more than tractors and tools at the Australian National Field Days – there’s almost everything for country residents and farmers. \nJohn Lulham, along with his wife Wendy and son Dave, run the Nick Nack Gallery and they’ve brought around 5000 hats made by Statesman, Barmah, Rigon and Jackeru. \nHis stock includes hats made from fur-felt or kangaroo leather and some approved by the Cancer Council. \nAfter 20 years of selling hats at the field days, Mr Lulham says a good hat is “one that fits”. \nMr Lulham said he travelled eastern Australia going from field days to the biggest regional agricultural shows. \nHe said some customers came back year after year, looking for a new hat which fit their children, “and often a new hat for themselves”. \nMr Lulham said Barmah’s kangaroo leather hats were the “Rolls-Royce” of the style – which were even rain shower-proof. \nMeanwhile, Statesmen hats started in 1835 in Brisbane, but the brand name was practically unknown despite supplying boarding schools and the Australian Defence Force. \nMr Lulham said while city dwellers had stopped wearing hats they remained an “essential accessory for country people”. \n“If you look at the movies and my grandfather, they all had fur-felt hats,” he said. \nThe Nick Nack Gallery will be located at site E4 during the Australian National Field Days from Thursday.",

      "text": "Use this content by Nick Bond \nBLOCK host Scott Cam has issued a grovelling public apology after calling the show's sole female judge a \"bitch\" on Sunday night's episode. \nCam jokingly called interior design guru Shaynna Blaze the b-word when revealing her scores for the contestants' front yards. \nAfter writing down the scores on the board, Cam looked at the group and joked: \"Some high scores and some low scores. And that Shaynna's a b***h, isn't she?\" Blaze was not present during the scene. \nWith some on social media fuming over his use of the word, the Gold Logie-winner did the radio rounds this morning, offering a mea culpa. Scott Cam said he called Shaynna to apologise after the episode aired. Picture: Andrew Henshaw \n\"Look, obviously I said that in complete jest, and I've said it to get a rise out of the contestants,\" he told Hit105's Stav, Abby and Matt with Osher. \n\"It was poor judgment on my part, and I've rung Shaynna and apologised. We're fantastic friends and we've worked together for a lot of years. She's incredible - she's a great designer, she's a great person, she's a great judge. She's certainly not 'that' . \n\"I did it in total jest, and it was just poor judgment. I've apologised - it was disrespectful, there was no doubt about that. Sometimes I'm an idiot,\" he continued. \nCam continued the whistlestop apology tour over on Fitzy and Wippa's Nova 969 morning show, telling the hosts: \"Sometimes I'm an idiot. It was disrespectful ... I shouldn't have done it.\" \nCam insisted that Blaze herself had not taken offence at the comment - but many viewers did, questioning whether Cam would use a similar epitaph to describe the show's two male judges, Darren Palmer and Neale Whitaker:",

Group of men playing around with a floating crocodile trap off Port Douglas. Source: Facebook \nAnne Cameron, 79, was taken by a 4.3m saltwater crocodile at Craiglie Creek, a short distance away from the inlet, the week earlier. \nThe crocodile was euthanased by rangers, however they could not rule out other large crocs being in the area. \nAn EHP spokeswoman confirmed the department had launched an investigation into the trap incident, strongly condemning the men's \"stupid and reckless\" interference with the equipment. \n\"These traps are specifically designed to attract crocodiles and they are deployed in places where a problem crocodile is known to be present,\" she said. \n\"It is extremely dangerous to interfere with a crocodile trap, regardless of whether or not there is a crocodile within. \n\"It is not an exaggeration to say that interfering with crocodile traps can be potentially life-threatening for the person concerned. \n\"It also places the general public at risk if the trap is tampered with in such a way that it becomes inoperative, hampering the ability of the Department to deliver its important public safety role.\" Group of men playing around with a floating crocodile trap off Port Douglas. Source: Facebook \nThe Palaszczuk Government has been cracking down on people to deliberately interfere with crocodile traps, increasing the penalty for the offence up to more than $15,000. \nEnvironment Minister Steven Miles said the latest incident \"took the cake\" in terms of people tampering with croc traps. \n\"We've got grown men, swimming in a crocodile trap, exactly where we put the bait for the crocodiles,\" he said. \n\"The reason the trap is there, is we suspect there are crocodiles in the area. \n\"So to be swimming here at all, is dangerous. \n\"To be swimming around the trap is dangerous. \n\"And if the crocodile were to appear, that would be even more dangerous. \n\"This is not far from where a woman was taken just a week ago.\" \nAnyone with information about the Port Douglas trap incident is urged to contact the department on 1300 130 372.",

It was ex-Brisbane, Collingwood and Carlton ruckman Cameron Wood, of course.\nThe journeyman — who retired at the end of the 2016 season — made an appearance on the quiz show on Monday afternoon and, contrary to what some would expect from a footy player, was successful.\nWinners are grinners 😀💰 let me know when you want to go to the footy too @anne_hegerty 🏉🌭 #TheChaseAus #TheGoverness #thankgodforpeter #YTB https://t.co/l0X0RmoWRE\n— Cameron Wood (@probably_wood) October 23, 2017 Congratulations to our winning team! 👏 #TheChaseAus pic.twitter.com/sxcCudwEqL\n— The Chase Australia (@THECHASEAUS) October 23, 2017 After pointing out that he was still playing local footy for Avondale Heights, Wood took on quizmaster Andrew O’Keefe and performed solidly, earning $10,000 for his team.\nHe then flirted with ‘The Governess’ — suggesting he could take her to an AFL match — before successfully making his way through into the final round.\n“A little bit of guessing going on there,” The Governess suggested.\nmedia_camera Cameron Wood celebrates a goal while playing for Carlton. Picture: Wayne Ludbey\nIn the end, Wood wasn’t best on ground, but was a solid contributor as his three-man team won $38,000 — money he said he’ll spend on taking his mum on a cruise up the Alaskan coast.\nNot bad for an afternoon’s work.\nOriginally published as Ex-AFL ruckman’s big game show win\nShare this on Facebook social-facebook_circle Share this on Twitter social-twitter_circle Share this by Email social-email_circle",

October 24 👤 by Sheldon Chanel, SUVA  0 Comments He’s an honest taxi driver. Ajesh Ram Deo, 39, on a usual Saturday last week had dropped off his passenger at My Suva Picnic Park and had picked up another when he heard the phone vibrating in the backseat. “I thought the vibrating phone belonged to the person I had picked up after my initial drop off,” Mr Deo said. His last passengers and the one in his vehicle then have been lone travellers and have sat in the front seat. “When I had dropped the passenger off in Sawani, the phone was still vibrating so I parked the car and checked the backseat. “I found the phone and it was the owner calling. When I answered, he sounded very concerned and said he had a lot of important information on his phone and that was when I said to him: ‘Brother, you forgot your phone in the right taxi’.” The passenger, Navi Rokodrega, who works in a printing company, had caught Mr Deo’s taxi earlier with his family to attend a prayer session. His mobile had slid out of his pocket when he disembarked from the taxi. He panicked when he felt for his pocket to reach for his phone but could not find it. By then, the cab had gone off. The phone, a Samsung Galaxy J1, was a gift from his son living in Australia. Mr Deo said: “I told him to relax and have a good day with his family and not to worry about his phone. “I did a few more jobs in the city before I drove to his location and returned the phone. He was so happy and insisted I accept $50 for my troubles, even when I kept refusing. “Many people say taxi drivers are dishonest people but I hold my principles in very high regard. “I didn’t see the point in keeping the phone and there’s also a thing called karma that I firmly believe in. If I had taken the phone, somehow, I would be punished for it.” Mr Rokodrega was full of praise for the driver, saying: “I wish all taxi drivers could be like him.” Edited by Karalaini Waqanidrola",

      "text": "WIN a Beautiful Designer Beach Shade from Hollie and Harrie \nHollie and Harrie is AUSTRALIA’S PREMIER AND ORIGINAL DESIGNER BEACH SHADE /SOMBRILLA \nLong time friends and founders, Skye Hollingsworth (Hollie) & Claire Harris (Harrie) from Melbourne Australia are joined together by a love of the sunny outdoors and family life. \nWe adore the beach and outdoors but dread the sunburn. We are very ‘sun smart’ but find the existing beach tents on the market too stifling, provide no natural air flow and our children do not enjoy sitting in them. \nAnd so we designed the Sombrilla as our first product. Stylish and extremely practical, children love playing (and adults love to relax!) under the shade provided by the Sombrilla and 95% UV protection will give you added peace of mind. OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA \nSince release of the Sombrilla sales both locally in Australia and internationally (USA, Europe and New Zealand) have increased each year with many sales to existing satisfied customers and the Sombrilla is now a common sight on many beaches around the world . \nIn Feb 2017 Hollie & Harrie was purchased by Australia’s largest importer and wholesaler of Beach Shade and Beach furniture –“The Beachkit Group” \nElegant & sophisticated, the Sombrilla is made from 100% cotton, so breathe & relax while enjoying superior sun protection. With optional configurations for high-sun and low-sun you’ll need to pack a picnic. You can now indulge in those long summer days at the beach blissfully unaware of the heat as you enjoy yourself under a cool canopy of natural shade. \nSince 2010 this is the Original and Best Australian Designer Beach Shade – our competitors have come and gone but they all initially buy our product to try and match our design and quality. \nRaw unbleached material, combined with silk screen printing gives each Sombrilla individual character. Slight variations in the print means you can be sure you have an original Hollie & Harrie beach shade. \nThanks to our friends at Hollie and Harrie we have 2 beautiful Sombrillas to GIVE AWAY to 2 of our lucky readers. If you or someone you know would love the chance to WIN one of these, simply enter your details below and good luck x",

      "text": "No winners from tenancy law tinkering \nNew Zealand rents continue to stagnate but they could be set to rise under the new government, according to Trade Me Property. \nThe real estate website’s latest rental index shows the national weekly rent remained unchanged at $450 in September for the tenth month in a row. \nIt was up by just 2.3% on September 2016 and it is the first time in over seven years that the national weekly rent has stagnated for such a long period of time. \nHead of Trade Me Property Nigel Jeffries said the country could be looking at a full year of flat rent at this point. \n“Typically the rental market is pretty quiet this time of year as landlords and tenants have been bunkered down for the winter, but it’s unusual to have seen the national rent figure stagnant for so long.” \nHowever, he said rent increases could be around the corner – with post-election uncertainty ending and summer on the way. \n“We expect to see some large increases early in the New Year as a large number of leases come up for renewal and the university year kicks into gear and boosts rental prices. \n“Many landlords choose the summer months to review their investment and rents jump as a result.” \nFurther, Jeffries said that the new Labour-led government could have an impact on the rental market. \n“Prior to the election, Labour indicated they had some big plans for the rental market including limiting rent rises to once a year. \n“It remains to be seen whether that promise survives coalition talks but the threat of these changes could cause jitters for landlords and result in some rent increases for tenants.” \nLooking around the country, rents remained steady at best in the main centres but a number of “halo” markets saw good growth. \nAuckland’s median weekly rent fell by $10 to $520 in September - although it was still up 4% on last year. \nAt the same time, rental prices in Wellington stayed steady at $450 per week and were up 9.8% year-on-year. \nJeffries said outside the main metropolitan areas, it was a mixed bag with some landlords seeing double-digit growth and others experiencing little to no change. \nBut landlords in both the Bay of Plenty and Northland should be happy: rents in the Bay of Plenty went up by $25 in September to $450, while Northland rents jumped by $20 to $395. \n“These halo regions have seen rent demand change drastically in the last few years as the Auckland property market has gone crazy,” he said. \n“The Bay of Plenty is once again level with Wellington as our second most expensive region, while Northland is just behind the record of $399 per week set back in in July.” \nThe news was not as good for South Island regions. \nThe median weekly rent in the West Coast and Marlborough dropped 6% to $235 and $320 respectively, while Canterbury’s median weekly rent fell 2.5% year-on-year to $390 per week.",

      "text": "Tweet \nMitchell Pearce could learn a thing or two from State of Origin rival Cooper Cronk if the Sydney Roosters sign him, according to Queensland coach Kevin Walters. \nThe Roosters remain front-runners ahead of Parramatta and Cronulla for Cronk's signature after the Queensland and Australian halfback told his manager last Friday he wanted to play on in Sydney. \nSuch a signing could create havoc for the Roosters' roster though, given Pearce has been their first-choice No.7 since 2007 and is signed until the end of 2019. \nThey could shift him to five-eighth or hooker but incumbents Luke Keary and captain Jake Friend are also contracted by the club into next season. \nThe rumours have fuelled speculation Pearce could be on the outer at Bondi, with two rival clubs having already reportedly expressed interest in the 28-year-old. \nBut Walters said if Cronk was to be lured to the Tri-colours, NSW Origin halfback Pearce should see it as an opportunity to stick around and learn. \n\"If I'm a Mitchell Pearce or a Luke Keary at that club, I'd probably want them in the club because you're going to get better with them there,\" Walters told Sky Sports Radio. \n\"Maybe a little time with Cooper Cronk might help (Pearce's) game and take it to another level, which is a bit scary from a Queensland point of view.\" \nPearce will also likely face mounting pressure in 2018 to keep his NSW Origin spot. \nThis year's series loss marked his seventh in as many attempts for the Blues, while the yet-to-be appointed NSW coach will likely have to make a call on whether Penrith teenager Nathan Cleary is ready to step into the arena. \nWalters insisted his comments weren't a shot at Pearce. \n\"We always see Mitchell and the talent he has,\" he said. \n\"I reckon (Pearce and Keary) would be pretty excited. If Cronk was to go to one of those clubs, he would certainly bring so much on the field but certainly off the field with how he goes about things. \n\"I've seen it at Origin level. Some of these players we bring in who come into camp, they learn more from Cronk and Slater and Smith, Thurston and Matt Scott and Inglis than they do the coaching staff.\" Advertisement",

The play, the eighth instalment in the popular book series, premiered on London’s West End last year and will open exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre in 2019 following a run on Broadway next year. “When we embarked on this journey, it was an objective to ensure we could get the production to Australia as soon as logistically possible,”producers Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender said. You can’t ever assume a new play is going to have a further life, but we knew that if Harry Potter and the Cursed Child did have a life beyond London and Broadway, that the next stop would be here,” they said. “The Harry Potter stories have millions of fans across the globe, and so we’re very happy and proud that we’re able to bring our beautiful production to Australia, where we know a whole new audience will experience the eighth story.” Melbourne is a fantastic city with such wonderful culture and heritage, and so we’re thrilled that the gorgeous Princess Theatre will be Cursed Child’s next home.” Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was written exclusively for the stage by the Harry Potter author Rowling , along with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, and takes up with Potter as a father-of-three and employee at the Ministry of Magic. The two-part stage play, designed to be seen in one day with a matinee and evening performance or on two consecutive nights, is the most awarded production in the history of Britain’s Olivier Awards, winning nine awards. Performance dates and ticketing details will be announced soon. – AAP Search real estate for sale or rent anywhere in Australia from licensed estate agents on simply type in any suburb in the search bar below Rent",

      "text": "Use this content by Nick Bond \nBLOCK host Scott Cam has issued a grovelling public apology after calling the show's sole female judge a \"bitch\" on Sunday night's episode. \nCam jokingly called interior design guru Shaynna Blaze the b-word when revealing her scores for the contestants' front yards. \nAfter writing down the scores on the board, Cam looked at the group and joked: \"Some high scores and some low scores. And that Shaynna's a b***h, isn't she?\" Blaze was not present during the scene. \nWith some on social media fuming over his use of the word, the Gold Logie-winner did the radio rounds this morning, offering a mea culpa. Scott Cam said he called Shaynna to apologise after the episode aired. Picture: Andrew Henshaw \n\"Look, obviously I said that in complete jest, and I've said it to get a rise out of the contestants,\" he told Hit105's Stav, Abby and Matt with Osher. \n\"It was poor judgment on my part, and I've rung Shaynna and apologised. We're fantastic friends and we've worked together for a lot of years. She's incredible - she's a great designer, she's a great person, she's a great judge. She's certainly not 'that' . \n\"I did it in total jest, and it was just poor judgment. I've apologised - it was disrespectful, there was no doubt about that. Sometimes I'm an idiot,\" he continued. \nCam continued the whistlestop apology tour over on Fitzy and Wippa's Nova 969 morning show, telling the hosts: \"Sometimes I'm an idiot. It was disrespectful ... I shouldn't have done it.\" \nCam insisted that Blaze herself had not taken offence at the comment - but many viewers did, questioning whether Cam would use a similar epitaph to describe the show's two male judges, Darren Palmer and Neale Whitaker:",

But that’s been going on for four years now, and — for reasons both within his control and beyond it — voters associate the growing debacle around the network entirely with him.

By the time they left three weeks later, more than 70 civilians had been killed - shot or beheaded, their bodies dumped in farms and ditches. The Islamic State militants came into the Syrian town with a hit list. By the time they left three weeks later, more than 70 civilians had been killed - shot or beheaded, their bodies dumped in farms and ditches. The apparent revenge killings in the town of Qaryatayn underscore the ability of the extremists to inflict heavy losses even when they're in retreat - and portend more violence as they fight to hang on to their last strongholds in Syria. News of the gruesome slayings began to emerge late on Sunday, after ISIS militants were driven out by advancing government troops. Terrified residents said they watched the slaughter from their windows or in the streets. One former resident said his surviving family members walked for miles to find cell phone coverage so they could tell him of the deaths of his uncle, two cousins and a fourth relative. Another uncle remains missing. \"They came into town with a hit list,\" said Abdullah AbdulKarim, adding that 35 of the 50 militants who overran the town late last month were originally from Qaryatayn. He said the militants accused many of their victims of collaborating with the government but many others were also caught in the revenge killing. \"Our curse is from within us,\" he said, speaking to The Associated Press from northern Syria, where he fled years ago. Killed children Once a predominantly Christian town known for its ancient monastery, Qaryatayn has changed hands between ISIS and the Syrian government several times during Syria's civil war. Parts of the 1500-year-old St. Elian monastery were demolished the first time ISIS took over the town in 2015 and thousands of its Christian residents fled, fearing the extremist group's brutality. An AP video, filmed as Syrian government troops recaptured Qaryatayn on Saturday, showed several bodies lying in the streets. In the video, a town resident said ISIS \"monsters\" killed more than 100 people, including soldiers and civilians. \"These are people who don't know God, they don't know anything. They killed children and women with knives, they beat women, broke their arms,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear for his own safety. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had documented the killings of at least 128 people in Qaryatayn, including at least 12 killed by government forces on suspicion of aiding the ISIS militants. AbdulKarim and Mohamed Hassan, an activist who runs the Palmyra Network News, put the death toll at 75 civilians, saying many more remain unaccounted for. They said the dead included some who were shot by government forces. But Hassan said most of the slayings were by Islamic State militants. \"It seems it was mostly revenge,\" he said. Another activist network, the Palmyra Coordination Committee, released the names of 67 civilians who were confirmed killed and said the number was likely to rise. It said at least 35 of the dead were found dumped inside a ditch. New offensive Talal Barazi, the governor of Homs province, said IS \"terrorised\" residents for three weeks, adding that most of the dead were townspeople who were government employees or were affiliated with Syria's ruling Baath party. He said at least 13 residents remained missing and six bodies had not been identified. ISIS militants first seized Qaryatayn in August 2015, and relied on its strategic location to defend another of their bastions, the historic city of Palmyra. With Russian backing, Syrian government troops regained control of Qaryatayn in April 2016. But ISIS, facing major setbacks in Syria and Iraq, launched a new offensive on the town in late September and recaptured it. AbdulKarim said during the three weeks that ISIS controlled the town, the militants went door to door looking for people they accused of collaborating with the Syrian government. He said his uncle, who was a local mayor, and two cousins were shot after they were taken to an undisclosed location. Another uncle remains missing. \"They took people to show them bodies dumped in an open area to let them know they were killed, but also to terrorise the public,\" AbdulKarim said. He said the extremists barred residents from burying their dead. He said the advancing government troops also killed civilians, but residents were too afraid to report the government killings. AbdulKarim and the Observatory said the militants took Qaryatayn's police chief, his wife and other security personnel as hostages to negotiate their exit after government troops encircled the town. About 200 militants evacuated the town, before government forces marched in, they said.",

      "text": "Mitchell Moses at Lebanon training on Tuesday. Photo: Supplied \nThe 23-year-old's stocks are on the rise after a strong finish to the season culminated in the Eels playing finals football for the first time since 2009. He will be able to show how much his game has matured in clashes with France, England and Australia in what could prove to be an invaluable opportunity to bond with Fittler. \nWith long-time NSW halfback Mitchell Pearce again under pressure to retain the NSW No.7 jersey after another failed campaign, Moses said he was keen to crack the Origin arena. \n\"Definitely, 100 per cent. It's my goal every year,\" Moses said. \n\"If I keep playing the footy I was playing towards the end of the year, that stuff will sort itself out. We'll see what happens.\" Advertisement \nMoses said the opportunity to impress the likely NSW coach wasn't lost on him. \n\"Exactly. Whatever [selectors] do, I grew up idolising Freddie, he was one of the best five-eighths in the game.

By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \n\"Whatever advice he can give me, I'm really going to listen in this camp. I'll take a lot out of this; whatever he has to say, I'll be listening. \n\"I'm not looking at it as in he's going to get the Blues job, I'll look at it as him being a world-class coach and a world-class player when he was playing. Whatever advice he has for me, I'll take in on board.\" \nFittler has already made his mark with the Cedars. The Panthers and Roosters legend has asked his squad to learn the Lebanese national anthem, orders his players to do 50 push-ups a day and encourages them to finish training by taking their boots off in an attempt to get back to nature. \nMoses is buying in. \n\"It's a bit different, he's a pretty relaxed bloke,\" he said. \n\"For myself, I looked up to Freddie when I was younger and I'll take as much as I can out of this camp. \n\"He's one of the best five-eighths to play the game so whatever he says and whenever he gives you a few pointers about the game, you're always going to listen.\" \nThe opportunity to come into Lebanon camp with a mix of NRL players and semi-professionals is just the tonic to help Moses overcome the heartbreak of Parramatta's finals exit. \n\"It's brought my spirits back up,\" he said. \"It was pretty shattering the way we finished and being here has helped me get over it. \n\"I've learned a lot [playing finals football]. The speed of the game, how much it changed, it's going to be the best thing for us as a team at Parramatta. We'll look to have a big year and take that experience into next season. \n\"I feel I've got a fair bit of improvement to go from this pre-season. Once this tournament is over I'll get straight back into training and get that full pre-eason under my belt. It will be massive.\"",

      "text": "by Jose Rojas Spanish in Greece \nBy the end of August of 2015, I had already travelled solo for almost 1 month around Europe. \nAt that time, I was in Greece, where I was going to spend about 1 week in total. I started with Athens and then took a ferry to Santorini. \nOn my first day, I was looking for the port of Fira but I got lost, so I kept walking. I was so awed with the scenery that I kept walking for over 3 hours until I got to the town of Oia. Have you ever seen any of those postcards with those white houses and blue rounded roofs? That is the place! \nAnyway, on my second day I managed to find the port of Fira and I took a cable car to get down there. \nOnce I was there, I took this group tour on a boat to visit some hotsprings and a volcano. \nWhen we were reaching the hotsprings, the boat just stopped in the middle of nowhere and they told us that we had to jump and swim on deep water to get to the hotsprings. \nThen I appreciated that my mum signed me up to swimming classes when I was a kid. \nSo I took my t-shirt off, jumped off the boat and swam like there was no tomorrow. And when I arrived to the hotsprings something unexpected happened: I was hearing someone speaking Spanish right behind me. \nSo I introduced myself. \nThey were 3 girls living in Barcelona who took a week off work to travel together around Greece. \nAnd they seemed pretty astonished when I told them that I had been travelling solo for a month and that I was moving to Melbourne after that trip. \nWe stuck together for a while and rode some donkeys uphill to go back to Fira. I was at the front during that ride, and at some point this girl took her camera off and made me a photo from the distance. \nCoincidentally, we were going to go to Crete next on the same day and almost at the same time, so we met again before catching the ferry and then we met again in Crete. \nThey rented a car to drive around that island and I joined them for a day. We went to this beach of which name I can’t remember, but I do remember it was far away from town and that it was incredibly beautiful. \nI got to know them a bit more personally and they told me a few of their stories. One of them said to me that she got a restraining order against her ex. Other mentioned that she was really from Galicia but moved to Barcelona a few years ago for work. \nAfter the beach, I went back to town and they continued their drive. I exchanged phone numbers with the girl who took that photo of me riding the donkey. Then we parted ways and never saw each other again. \n…or that’s what I thought that would happen. I will tell you what really happened with them on my next posts! Share this:",

      "text": "Distinctive city-fringe office block placed on the market  15 pm \n24.10.2017 \nDistinctive city-fringe office block placed on the market for sale \nA large commercial office block immediately adjacent to Auckland University’s central city campus – and tenanted by a variety of corporate entities - has been placed on the market for sale. \nThe property known as Hamburg Sud House at 52 Symonds Street features eight storeys of commercial office space above three levels of car parking – sitting on 1193 square metres of freehold land zoned business city centre zone. \nThe distinctive mirror glass octagonal-shaped tower borders onto Auckland University’s school of fine arts campus, and is near to the some of the university’s halls of residence – overlooking the Grafton Gulley motorway on and off ramps. \nThe property currently generates a total net passing rental income of $936,636.93 plus GST per annum from multiple tenancies. \nThe modern office block complex is being marketed for sale by tender through Bayleys Auckland, with tenders closing at 4pm on November 16. Salespeople Chris Bayley and Lloyd Budd said the building had an A+ seismic classification. \n“There is considerable potential upside to increase revenue from the property – with vacant office space available for lease on the ground, first, and second floors,” Mr Bayley said. \n“While the building was constructed in 1984, it has subsequently undergone multiple upgrades and office reconfigurations over the ensuing decades. These, combined with an ongoing maintenance schedule, have ensured the internal fit outs have been undertaken to very high standards.” \nThe octagonal design of the building – typical of Auckland’s early-1980s commercial architecture period which saw a large number of buildings erected on the Symonds Street ridgeline – allows for high volumes of natural light into the interior space. \nConversely, looking out, the offices inside have excellent views over Auckland Domain, with the upper levels also enjoying views of the Waitemata Harbour. \nMr Budd expected that based on current commercial leasing trends in the eastern city-fringe vicinity, it would be relatively easy to find new tenancies for the currently empty areas within Hamburg Sud House – with all floors served by two passenger lifts and with air conditioning throughout. \n“Vacancy rates within the Symonds Street Ridge fell to five percent when recorded earlier this year,” Mr Budd said. \n“Overall inventory within the Symonds Street Ridge precinct has been declining for a number of years as a result of an increase in residential use within converted premises – either totally as apartment towers, or in mixed-use formats,” he said. \n“This style of reconfigured use is obvious in nearby properties such as 38 Whittaker Place and 71 Symonds Street. The overall floor plate of stock within the precinct has subsequently declined from just over 100,000 square metres in 2008 to approximately 85,000 square metres earlier this year. \n“Of that remaining space, the tertiary education sectors is the largest occupier, followed by professional services firms in the legal, IT, and communications sectors.” Bayleys Real Estate \nNew Zealand \nBayleys is New Zealand's largest full-service real estate company.

      "text": "Why the Kangaroos are the Death Star premium_icon by Nick Campton \nIN the grand scheme of things, whenever Australia lose it's good for international rugby league. \nThe Kangaroos are the colossus of Test football. In the last 10 years they've lost to New Zealand five times, drew with them once and beaten everybody else they've played, accumulating a 39-5-1 record against all opposition. \nSince Great Britain beat Australia 23-12 in the 2006 Tri Nations, the closest the Poms have come to beating the Kangaroos was a 16-12 defeat in the 2014 Four Nations. In the 21st century, Great Britain/England have three wins against Australia from 24 attempts. \nFrance are the only other team to have ever beaten Australia and the last time they did that was in 1978. The French lost 52-30 to Australia in 2004 and that match is the closest any tier two nation has come to beating Australia in the last 20 years. \nTEAMS: Who will play in week one? \nThe Kangaroos deserve a lot of credit for their continued supremacy, especially over the last 18 months after it looked like New Zealand had well and truly overtaken them in 2014-15. \nBut Australia, as good as they may be, are the schoolyard bullies. They're the big men on campus, the unstoppable force, the Death Star, the favourites in every game they play and every game they have played in the last 20 years. \nThey're the prohibitive favourites for this World Cup and it would take something truly shocking for anyone else to get the prize. But if someone else did, if New Zealand or England or Tonga could somehow claw their way past the green and gold juggernaut, it would give international rugby league a serious shot in the arm. \nIt's no coincidence that New Zealand's 24-0 thumping in the 2005 Tri Nations final was followed by victories in the 2008 World Cup, the 2010 Four Nations and the 2014 Four Nations. No one Kiwi player appeared in all four matches, it was a true generational shift. Australia romped to victory in the 2013 World Cup. \nAnother New Zealand win would be a boost, but an England World Cup win could be one of the greatest moments in that country's rugby league history. \nRugby league in England is in a tough spot. It has the history and the tradition and the fanatical support in the north but the clubs are perennially short of cash and the struggle to move beyond the game's birthplace has been tough. \nThe Test side hasn't won a tournament since 1972 and even then it was on a count back. They haven't made a World Cup final since 1995. It has been a tough few decades for the Lions, first as Great Britain and then as England. \nA win would give the game in the UK some much needed wider exposure and provide success-starved England sports fans some desperately needed glory. It would be the kind of win the fans would remember for the rest of their lives. \nNew Zealand footy people will talk about the 2008 World Cup final for as long as the game is played. The haka before the match, Billy Slater's gaffe that lead to Benji Marshall's try, the decisive penalty try to Lance Hohaia, the match-sealing score to Adam Blair, the scenes afterwards - they're iconic images of New Zealand rugby league. Australia are again the warm favourites. \nAnd if Tonga somehow, someway, manage to win it all? Forget about it. \nIt would be the greatest day in international rugby league history. Jason Taumalolo would become an all-time footballing legend. They would rename islands after him. \nIf Australia win, and they probably will, its just one more tournament victory. \nAnother win among many. Special and unique in its own way without a doubt, but without the singular significance of an England or New Zealand victory. \nThat's not to denigrate the achievements of the Kangaroos by any means. \nThe team that romped to victory in the 2013 tournament was among the finest ever to leave these shores. This time around there's a truly fascinating mix of the old guard and the new generation - Mal Meninga's squad has a fun mix of grizzled veterans and hungry youngsters. \nThe likes of Cameron Munster, Michael Morgan and Tom Trbojevic making their mark on the Test arena is a recipe for a good time and the return of Billy Slater promises to be a treat. Most of the Kangaroos recent losses have come without Johnathan Thurston. \nThis will also be the final time we see Slater, Cameron Smith and Cooper Cronk all play together, a gift many fans won't appreciate until its over. \nAustralia will play some brilliant football on their way to a probable victory, and no matter the result they'll be appointment viewing because they are the best in the world. \nBut things are better for Test footy when they lose. Mal Meninga is one of Test football's champions, a true believer in the importance of the international game. \nIronically, the best thing he could do for Test footy would be to fail.",

Fedpol. Photo: Andrew Meares  Photo: Andrew Meares And two weeks after those hearings, the court will rule on Friday at 2.15pm on Mr Joyce's fate, and that of six senators: Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash, former Nationals cabinet minister Matt Canavan, former Greens senators Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam, One Nation's Malcolm Roberts and NXT leader Nick Xenophon.\nIf a byelection is ordered in Mr Joyce's northern NSW seat of New England, the earliest the poll can be held is December 2.\nAs the only lower house MP, and with the Turnbull government holding just 76 seats in the 150-member lower house, it is Mr Joyce's case the government is most concerned about, although independent MP Cathy McGowan said on Tuesday that she would continue to support the government, which gives the Coalition some breathing room.\nFairfax Media spoke to half a dozen Nationals MPs on Tuesday and the prevailing view was that Mr Joyce, who referred himself to the Court in August when he learnt he was a New Zealander by descent through his father James, is that a byelection is increasingly likely.\nAdvertisement \"That fact that it has taken so long for the court to make its ruling doesn't bode well,\" one MP, who asked not to be named, said, \"and all sorts of theories are sweeping the place.\"\n\"Let's get through to Friday and see what happens,\" said another MP. \"The fact it has taken two weeks is a worry. Confidence has been eaten away as the days have gone by.\"\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly said that, based on the advice of the Solicitor-General, \"We are very, very confident that our members who have been caught up in this will be held by the court to be eligible to sit in the Parliament and therefore eligible to be ministers.\"\nB ut another Nationals source said that the two-week delay in the ruling could favour Mr Joyce as a \"black letter law\" decision against the Nationals leader would likely have been made quickly.\nWhile confidence is falling in government ranks that the court will rule favourably for Mr Joyce, to a person Nationals MPs believe Mr Joyce would win a byelection that could feature a Melbourne Cup field of candidates from Labor, One Nation, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, and possibly former New England independent and political foe Tony Windsor.\nIf Mr Joyce loses his seat, Nationals Senate leader Nigel Scullion is the next in line to take over by dint of seniority, even though he is in the upper house and the Coalition will likely face at least one sitting week without Mr Joyce as lower house leader.\nInfrastructure Minister Darren Chester and Small Business Minister Michael McCormack are both seen as future leaders of the Nationals and are in the lower house.\nABC psephologist Antony Green told Fairfax Media that December 2 was the most likely date should a byelection be ordered, but December 9 was possible if a Queensland state election was called for November 25.",

      "text": "Will NZ defectors ever play for Kiwis again? 24th Oct 2017 10:53 AM Use this content by Laine Clark \nEMOTIONAL New Zealand coach David Kidwell has given no guarantee that the likes of Jason Taumalolo will be welcomed back into the Kiwi side after their controversial rugby league World Cup defection to Tonga. \nKidwell on Sunday regularly had to take a moment to compose himself when talking about his nightmare Cup preparation. \nHe was blindsided by Taumalolo's decision to play for Tonga along with the likes of fellow Kiwis Manu Ma'u, Sio Siua Taukieaho and David Fusitu'a. \nWhile Kidwell said he respected Taumalolo's call and believed the hardships had made him a better coach, he was clearly still unhappy with the Cowboys wrecking ball. \n\nAsked if the door would be open to Taumalolo for a future Kiwi return, Kidwell said: \"The space we are in right now, it's not up to me.\" But he added: \"I 100 per cent respect his decision to play for Tonga. \n\"But the group of people we have got have a sense of belonging in that jersey. \n\"That's where my focus is, that's where everyone's energy is.\" \nTaumalolo reportedly brushed New Zealand to protest Kidwell's bold decision to slap a World Cup ban on skipper Jesse Bromwich and backrower Kevin Proctor after a cocaine controversy following their trans-Tasman Test loss in May. Jason Taumalolo has been based with the Tongan side out of Cairns. Picture: Anna Rogers \nKidwell - who took over the Kiwi reins from Stephen Kearney late last year - also lost his assistant days before the tournament after Garth Brennan was appointed head coach of NRL club the Gold Coast Titans. \n\"Dealing with adversity, I think every coach goes through it at different stages - I have just had to face it at the start,\" Kidwell said. \n\"But if I hadn't gone through that it wouldn't have made me the person I am now - it has made me a stronger coach.\" \nIn what appeared to be thinly veiled swipe at his defectors, Kidwell's chest swelled with pride when he spoke of the passion his squad had for the Kiwi jersey. Kevin Proctor and Jesse Bromwich being banned from the world cup is believed to have sparked Taumalolo’s defection to Tonga. Picture: Wayne Ludbey \n\"You always have a vision as coach and I couldn't be more proud of this group of men - it's better than I thought,\" Kidwell said. \n\"Everyone in there feels a sense of belonging, they are there to make it better, the culture - these players are shaping it. \n\"It's how I envision what the jersey deserves. The 24 men we have got in there, deserve to be in there.\" The stage is set for a fiery New Zealand clash with Tonga in their group stage showdown on November 11. \nThey open their campaign against Samoa at Mt Smart Stadium on Saturday, before travelling to Christchurch to play Scotland on November 4 and then the Tongans.",

      "text": "The legitimacy of the Labour-led government Tuesday October 24, 2017 2 POLITICAL ROUNDUP Dr Bryce Edwards Jacinda Ardern is the prime minister-elect, although her party won't be the largest in Parliament (photo: Jerry Yelich-O'Connor) Play NBR radio on \nMany New Zealanders are disgruntled that the new government does not include the largest party in Parliament – National, which won 44.4% of the vote. Some are even questioning the legitimacy of the Labour-led government. \nIt’s worth checking out a basic but ingenious explanation of MMP coalition government from the following Facebook post from Eva Allan : “Allow me to explain MMP: There's one mince and cheese pie left in the shop it costs $5. Bill has $4.50. Jacinda has $3.70. Winston has 70c. James has 60c and David has 5c. No one has enough money to buy the pie by themselves but Jacinda, Winston and James put their money together and buy the pie. Bill gets no pie because he needed 50c but didn't have any friends to help him pay for the pie. I hope this helps explain things.” \nLegitimacy challenged This Facebook post has been a hit, and the reason it has resonated so strongly is there are still plenty of loud challenges being made to the legitimacy of the new government. The fact that the three parties that came second, third, and fourth in the election have been able to combine to get a majority in Parliament is, of course, a new phenomenon. New Zealand hasn’t seen this under MMP yet, although it was always going to eventually. \nIn fact, having the biggest party get 44% of the vote and not be in government is incredibly rare, even in other countries with proportional representation. Jane Clifton has been searching around and found that “the only other time it has happened was in Sweden in the 1970s” – see her latest column, Minority Rules: Who will be the first voted off Coalition Island . \nFor the most colourful and interesting challenge to the legitimacy of the new government, see Richard Prebble’s column, Jacinda Ardern will regret this coalition of losers . Prebble makes the astonishing allegation: “There has been a coup. The political scientists can tell us it's legal but the fact remains – it is undemocratic. For the first time in our history who governs us is not the result of an election but the decision of one man. Jacinda Ardern is prime minister in name only. The only real power that the prime minister has is to allocate portfolios.” \nMr Prebble goes further with the hyperbole, saying that “New Zealand is now a shogunate. In Japan, the emperor had the title and the shogun had all the power.” \nThis column has received an exasperated reply from Chris Trotter, who says “there is not a word of truth in any of this”, and he suggests Mr Prebble knows this and is simply trying to lay the ground for a counter-coup in which the new government is brought down – see: Dark transactions: Winston Peters decision to “Go Left” has already set his enemies in motion . \nMr Prebble’s eccentric arguments aren’t entirely marginal – in fact they’re broadly in line with a media that has given considerable weight to the idea that National has a “moral authority” or mandate to govern due to enjoying greater popularity than Labour. \nThis is actually best conveyed on the front page of The Australian newspaper, which had a large headline declaring “NZ Shock: Losers take power.” You can see this front page and others in my blog post: Newspaper frontpages on the New Zealand election and new government . \nAlthough the Australian newspaper might simply be ignorant of the local constitutional reality in New Zealand, much of the New Zealand media also pushed a similar line about National’s position. \nNewspaper front pages in this country were very one-sided after the election, suggesting National had “won” and that it was almost a formality that New Zealand First would put National back into office. \nIn fact, the Sunday Star-Times editorial after the election said: “Let us be clear: Mr Peters has no choice. The voting public cannot, and will not, tolerate him abusing his kingmaker position by swinging his support behind Ms Ardern, when she is trailing 13 seats behind National. Some will be happy with this outcome; some disappointed. But the result is clear and unequivocal. A record 2.5 million New Zealanders voted. An unprecedented 1.2 million voted for National” – see Jonathan Milne’s Voters cannot, and will not, tolerate Winston abusing his kingmaker position . \nArguments against the 'moral authority' line \nAs Eva Allan’s Facebook post conveys, the simple answer to those who dispute the legitimacy of the new government is to point out that the National Party doesn’t have the necessary majority of seats in Parliament whereas the combined three parties of government do. Bryan Gould points out “The only thing that matters – as it always does under any voting system in a Westminster-style parliament – is that it must be able to win crucial votes in Parliament – that is, it must have a parliamentary majority. How that majority is made up, and whether or not it includes the largest party, is completely irrelevant. A coalition of (let us say) the five smallest parties in parliament would be perfectly legitimate, as long as it commanded a majority” – see: How MMP is meant to work . \nSimilarly, MMP campaigner Hans Grueber says, “It does not matter if the majority is reached by one, two, three or any number of parties as long as they together represent the majority of the voters. That is why a proportional system is regarded as the most democratic. Majority rules. There is nothing undemocratic about the fact that the voters have decided not to give one party an absolute majority but spread their votes among four parties in the clear expectation that these parties would have to compromise and work together to form a coalition to reach a majority in Parliament” – see: Nothing says the largest party has moral right to govern . \nHowever, the best refutation of the “moral authority” argument has been made in a stream of tweets by Michael Appleton‏ (@michelappleton). Not only does he make logical arguments about the legitimacy of the new government but Mr Appleton also calculates how much popular support this government has compared to previous ones. He finds that the Ardern administration “represents a higher proportion of Kiwi voters” than two-thirds of governments since 1936. For ease of reading, I have compiled all of his tweets in one blog post: Has the new NZ government been installed by an undemocratic coup? A Twitter reply . \nSo why has the media given so much weight to the idea that the party with the most seats should govern? Public law expert Edward Willis has blogged on “Why the media got it wrong” (as well as why they are wrong) – see: Why being the largest party matters (and why it doesn't) . \nWillis has two possible answers – one is that the media deemed accuracy less important than the need for copy and controversy, and the second is “the issue is a subtle one, and the news media isn't adept at drawing distinctions between political and constitutional questions.” \nFinally, for a further dose of the “moral authority” argument – including from National's Northland MP Matt King – see Laura Macdonald’s MMP attacked online after coalition formed .

Recent research by the NZCTU shows that between 1998 and 2015 hourly wages rose twice as fast for those at the top of the wage range, compared to those below the average. And the big driver of any increases for those on the lowest wages was increases to the minimum wage. \n“This will make a huge difference to the dignity of the many, many people who are working hard for low wages in this country – many more than there should be. And it is a much-needed tonic for the broken wage-setting process we have endured for so many years in this country.” \n“It also shows what this new Government can achieve in coalition and the value New Zealand First brings to the partnership. There are plenty of things to be done and this is a great start”. \nENDS",

      "text": "No winners from tenancy law tinkering \nNew Zealand rents continue to stagnate but they could be set to rise under the new government, according to Trade Me Property. \nThe real estate website’s latest rental index shows the national weekly rent remained unchanged at $450 in September for the tenth month in a row. \nIt was up by just 2.3% on September 2016 and it is the first time in over seven years that the national weekly rent has stagnated for such a long period of time. \nHead of Trade Me Property Nigel Jeffries said the country could be looking at a full year of flat rent at this point. \n“Typically the rental market is pretty quiet this time of year as landlords and tenants have been bunkered down for the winter, but it’s unusual to have seen the national rent figure stagnant for so long.” \nHowever, he said rent increases could be around the corner – with post-election uncertainty ending and summer on the way. \n“We expect to see some large increases early in the New Year as a large number of leases come up for renewal and the university year kicks into gear and boosts rental prices. \n“Many landlords choose the summer months to review their investment and rents jump as a result.” \nFurther, Jeffries said that the new Labour-led government could have an impact on the rental market. \n“Prior to the election, Labour indicated they had some big plans for the rental market including limiting rent rises to once a year. \n“It remains to be seen whether that promise survives coalition talks but the threat of these changes could cause jitters for landlords and result in some rent increases for tenants.” \nLooking around the country, rents remained steady at best in the main centres but a number of “halo” markets saw good growth. \nAuckland’s median weekly rent fell by $10 to $520 in September - although it was still up 4% on last year. \nAt the same time, rental prices in Wellington stayed steady at $450 per week and were up 9.8% year-on-year. \nJeffries said outside the main metropolitan areas, it was a mixed bag with some landlords seeing double-digit growth and others experiencing little to no change. \nBut landlords in both the Bay of Plenty and Northland should be happy: rents in the Bay of Plenty went up by $25 in September to $450, while Northland rents jumped by $20 to $395. \n“These halo regions have seen rent demand change drastically in the last few years as the Auckland property market has gone crazy,” he said. \n“The Bay of Plenty is once again level with Wellington as our second most expensive region, while Northland is just behind the record of $399 per week set back in in July.” \nThe news was not as good for South Island regions. \nThe median weekly rent in the West Coast and Marlborough dropped 6% to $235 and $320 respectively, while Canterbury’s median weekly rent fell 2.5% year-on-year to $390 per week.",

      "text": "Auckland major events funding applications now open RELEASE SUMMARY \n• Applications for major events sponsorship from Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED) are now open. \n• ATEED sponsors major events, on behalf of Auckland Council, to realise economic and social benefits for Auckland. \n• The region’s investment in major events is guided by Auckland’s Major Events Strategy, which was named the world’s Best Events Strategy at the 2016 SportBusiness Ultimate Sports City Awards. \n• Applications are open to domestic and international events operators whose events can deliver new money for Auckland and help make it a desirable place to live, work, study and visit. \nThe annual application round for Auckland major events sponsorship opens today. \nFunding is allocated by Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED), on behalf of Auckland Council. ATEED invests in major events to realise economic and social benefits for Auckland. \nATEED is calling for applications from New Zealand and international event operators for major multi-year and one-off events happening from 1 July 2018 onwards. \nATEED General Manager Destination Steve Armitage says Auckland has gained international recognition as a world-class host city with an award-winning Major Events Strategy. \n“Auckland is having a bumper year for major events this year, with World Masters Games 2017, the DHL New Zealand Lions Series and inaugural MCKAYSON New Zealand Women’s Open already held here this year, and the Rugby League World Cup 2017, Women’s Hockey World League Final and Auckland’s first editions of EQUITANA and NZ Flower & Garden Show still to come. \n“These are in addition to perennial Auckland favourites including the Auckland Lantern Festival, Pasifika, the ASB Auckland Marathon and ASB Classic, the New Zealand International Film and Comedy Festivals, creating a diverse and exciting events calendar for Auckland.” \nSince Auckland’s Major Events Strategy was approved by Auckland Council in 2011, ATEED-sponsored major events have contributed $247 million to the regional economy and 1,548,000 visitor nights (from 2011/12 FY – 2015/16 FY). \nThe application period is open until Monday, 18 December. Potential applicants can attend Auckland-based workshops on the Major Events Strategy and the application process on Monday, 6 and Wednesday, 8 November. \nThe sponsorship round gives priority to events that align with Auckland’s Major Events Strategy. All events are assessed for their ability to generate GDP for Auckland (new money that would not otherwise be spent in the region), increase domestic and international visitors nights, build awareness of Auckland internationally, and make Auckland an interesting and exciting place to live. \nOutcomes of the 2018/19 sponsorship application process will be announced from late March 2018. NOTES TO EDITOR \n• Application information, including assessment critieria, application forms and Auckland’s Major Events Strategy, are available at https://www.aucklandnz.com/about-ateed/about-us/what-we-do/major-events/funding \n• All successful ATEED sponsorship funding for major events is subject to performance-based contracts. \n• Key dates \no 24 October – 18 December 2017 – applications open \no 6 and 8 November 2017 - Auckland-based information session on the application process \no December 2017 – March 2018 – evaluation of sponsorship applications \no From late March 2018 – sponsorship decisions announced (other than for those requiring additional assessment) \n© Scoop Media Message from Scoop: To our readers - Your support is pivotal to achieving a strong and sustainable future for independent news media in New Zealand.

Even a fall of less than three metres can result in serious injuries or death. Identifying the need for a barrier to protect workers on the mezzanine floor was imperative to avoiding this incident.” \nThe WorkSafe New Zealand investigation found that the company had failed to conduct an adequate risk assessment to identify the risk of a fall from height and failed to ensure appropriate controls, such as edge protection or a balustrade, were in place to protect workers from the risk of fall onto the false ceiling. \nRangiora Carpets was fined $157,500 and ordered to pay reparations to the victim of $20,000 in the Christchurch District Court.

      "text": "Tina Perinotto | 23 October 2017 \nThere’s good news on the way in New Zealand for green buildings and housing in particular if the new government can help it, NZ Green Building Council chief executive Andrew Eagles says. \nIt was Labour Day in New Zealand on Monday – maybe fittingly so. Labour’s brand new prime minister Jacinta Ardern had spent the weekend in media briefings laying down the new political landscape for New Zealand. One that slightly shellshocked observers worldwide were guessing could be as scene stealing as when NZ declared it would be nuclear free. \nThe initial raft of promises from Ardern in a coalition of Labour, New Zealand First and The Greens includes great news on the environment, with a commitment to go net zero carbon by 2050 and another to lift the quality of the country’s notoriously poor housing stock. \nBetter minimum wages were also on the cards as was the possibility that the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement could be broken if it were the only way to stem the purchase of NZ housing by foreigners, believed to be pushing up prices. \nArdern, New Zealand style, didn’t mince words. Capitalism had failed the people of New Zealand , she said. \n“If you have hundreds of thousands of children living in homes without enough to survive, that’s a blatant failure. What else could you describe it as?” \nIn another report she said, “There is no point gloating about the economic growth of a nation if you have some of the highest rates of homelessness in the developed world.” \nHer plan also included dealing with water pollution and improving rates of child poverty. \nAnd no, none of this meant the end of the world as we know it. She was sure business and government could work together to get better outcomes. Andrew Eagles \nUnaware it was a holiday The Fifth Estate called the New Zealand Green Building Council to see what our closest cousins over the ditch thought of all this. \nChief executive of the New Zealand Andrew Eagles answered the phone straight away – himself. \nIt reminded us of the story also doing the rounds on Monday morning of a “stunned” ABC Radio journalist in Australia who called the New Zealand PM’s office to check the pronunciation of the Ardern’s name only to have the PM herself pick up the call and explain, it’s “AH-durn”. \n“It was no trouble at all,” she told The New Zealand Herald. \nCertainly for The Fifth Estate it felt like a lucky break to get straight to the source, on a public holiday. \n“Ardern is good on a number of fronts,” Eagles said. \n“The Nationals have had nine years [it was time for a change] and she’s a woman. And she’s more supportive on climate change, which is a positive. It’s quite an interesting outcome.” \nEagles said the indications for property and housing in particular were good. \nHis team had been working away for quite a while on discussions with the government around improving building standards and especially in the nation’s poor quality housing sector. \n“We’ve been having some really good conversations around this prior to the election,” he said. \n“Forty per cent of homes are damp and mouldy so we should be building better homes to higher standards and it would have huge positive health benefits.” \nOn energy bills alone it was estimated New Zealander households could save NZ$1000 (AU$893) a year with six star Homestar ratings and with insulation. \nIt’s about lower carbon emissions, he said, but also about better, healthier outcomes. \n“We have 20,000 homes confirmed for Homestar and we expect that to rise significantly under the new government.” \nEagles said there was an expectation that if the government increased standards it would influence the industry since the government was the biggest house builder in the country. \nRecent discussions have also included the possibility of tighter regulations in building standards. \n“We’ve been campaigning to set a trajectory to improve the buildings sector.” The OECD and the International Energy Agency had both said standards were behind those of countries with similar climates. This translated to standards twice as bad as Australia’s and three times worse than the UK’s, he said. \n“Maybe by 2020 we move to a better insulation standard and better ventilation, and by 2023 we’re moving to blower testing and thermal bridging.” \nIt’s these kinds of actions that are needed to meet a trajectory to zero carbon by mid century, Eagles said. \n“This government will probably lead on housing. The housing minister, Phil Twyford, has committed to 100,000 homes in 10 years. And he will be a member of cabinet. \n“This is signalling the importance Labour has put on housing.” \nIn the commercial space Eagles said there had been good take up of Green Star ratings in offices, and he hoped this would now extend to defence and education buildings. \n“We think there will be more Green Star take up in buildings from this government and a more rapid uptake of Green Star Performance,” he said. \nThe NZGBC is also launching a carbon neutral standard next year. \n“When we say we need to get to net zero carbon by 2050, we can’t do it without this,” Eagles said. \nAnother piece of positive news was that Greens Leader James Shaw was in line to be minister for climate. \nSo how will Australia react to such dramatic changes so close to home? \nWe know our Feds are more likely to take their cues from the noisy folk across the Pacific than from across the ditch, but at least it will be interesting that our decision makers will observe at close quarters that serious action on climate and housing and well, social sustainability, could be made to happen without, we’ll bet, the sky falling in. \nMaybe they’ll even feel a pinprick of conscience … or envy.",

Press Release: 24 October 2017 \nBacking for policy on housing’s threat to food \nThe NZ Food & Grocery Council backs the call from Horticulture NZ for a national food security policy focused on the threat to food production from urban sprawl. \nChief Executive Katherine Rich says concerns raised by Horticulture NZ at the effect urban development is having on prized horticulture land, particularly land that used to grow local vegetables, are well founded. \n“Horticulture NZ says we have lost about 10,000 hectares of horticulture land to housing in just 15 years between 2001 and 2016. That’s a staggering amount, particularly if you consider the value of all the food not produced. \n“Fresh fruits and vegetables must be part of a healthier diet for Kiwis. We need Kiwis to eat more of them, not fewer. The long-term impact of losing some of New Zealand’s best and most productive soils is worrying. \n“With the new Government’s goal to build 10,000 new houses a year, the pressure is only going to increase, so it’s important to get an overall plan about land use. The pressure will no doubt be greatest around the Auckland and Hamilton regions, and also the Bay of Plenty, where a lot of our most fertile land is. \n“Look at Pukekohe – it’s the major producer of vegetables for the people of Auckland, but the population there is expected to double in the next 30 years due to its proximity to Auckland. Where are the houses going to go? When you pave Pukekohe, you’ll lose a massive amount of food production for generations to come. \n“There needs to be a serious conversation around a policy focused on preserving more of the land that feeds us, and that means about where we should build houses and where we shouldn’t. \n“We need to find a balance, but we can’t afford to allow our most productive land to continue to disappear. \n“The Food & Grocery Council supports the advocacy of Horticulture NZ, and we hope this is an issue the incoming Government considers as a matter of urgency.” \nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz",

      "text": "EU offers 106 million euros in humanitarian aid for Sudan EU offers 106 million euros in humanitarian aid for Sudan By AFP Tuesday Oct 24, 2017 A poster by Save The Children is seen at a press conference by the organisation, wherein it announced the launch of their Sudanese mission in capital city Khartoum, October 19, 2017. AFP/Ashraf Shazly KHARTOUM: The European Commission on Monday announced a 106-million-euro ($124-million) aid package for Sudan, saying around 4.8 million people needed urgent humanitarian assistance in the African country. \nThe new aid comes at a time United Nations aid agencies are facing an acute shortage of funds from global donors to meet relief needs in Sudan. \nThe package was announced as Christos Stylianides — the EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management — was on a visit to Sudan, including to conflict-hit areas of Darfur. \n\"Here in Sudan the humanitarian situation continues to be critical,\" Stylianides said in a statement issued by the European Commission. \n\"Millions have been displaced for many, many years in Darfur,\" he said, adding that the new EU funding will also assist refugees from South Sudan since a conflict erupted in their country in December 2013. \nOf the total 106 million euros, 46 million will address humanitarian needs including food, nutrition, health, protection, shelter, education, water, and sanitation, the European Commission said. The remaining 60 million euros are to be channelled through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, to support displaced people, migrants and host communities. \n\"The additional funding will scale up much-needed assistance both for South Sudanese refugees and in the newly opening areas in Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Jebel Marra,\" the top UN aid official in Sudan, Marta Ruedas told AFP. \n\"The fact that it addresses both humanitarian and development needs in Sudan is a welcome sign of a more flexible response to the real needs of a protracted crisis.\" \nThe United Nations aid agencies have been facing funding shortages in 2017 concerning the humanitarian needs of millions of people in Sudan. \nThe UN agencies had appealed for $804 million in aid for Sudan for 2017, but so far only 39 percent of that had been raised, the United Nations says. \nIt says the lack of money has led to dozens of health facilities being closed in conflict zones of Darfur, Blue Nile, and South Kordofan.

Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The NSW Land & Environment Court has knocked back RDA Property Group's appeal to build seven more units at its Bronte Place mixed-use apartment project at the controversial former Bronte RSL site in Sydney's eastern suburbs.\nSubjected to years of public protests, RDA , led by former fashion identity Danny Avidan , was the last in a line of developers to take on the project at at 109-113 Macpherson Street , approved for 21 apartments last year.\nRDA lodged a revised development application in December, in accordance with the Local Environment Plan, but was refused by Waverley Council.\nAfter facing court with an appeal three weeks ago, Commissioner Dickson on Tuesday dismissed the appeal due to the solar impact the additional units could cause to existing approved units.\nAny revisions to height and other development potential should be made through a planning proposal rather than a revision to the council approval, the commissioner said.\n Mr Avidan said he accepted the decision and would push on with the project, which has already been delayed.\n\"I respectfully accept the court's decision despite the fact that I disagree with the findings. I will proceed with the current approvals,\" he said.\nThe project is on a 2231 sq m site with ground-floor retail space, and is close to Bronte Beach.\nThe community, led by the Save Bronte group, protested the developer's decision to vary the 21-unit low-rise approval.",

He will meet PM Modi, EAM Sushma Swaraj to discuss the implementation of the ideas he outlined during his famous \"Defining Our Relationship With India for the Next Century\" speech at a Washington Think Tank. The speech lauded India and lashed out Pakistan and China. He said \"China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order even as countries like India operate within a framework that protects other nations’ sovereignty.\" He particularly came hard on chinese connectivity plans like OBOR saying \"China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries\". Pakistan was again asked to act on terror groups. Tillerson said \"We expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based within their own borders that threaten their own people and the broader region\". Delhi Kabul Ties In diplomacy things are always planned. The visit of US, Afghan leaders in Delhi shows a convergence. One in South Asia and one for the world. Kabul is eager to reconstruct and recover from 3 decades of war. India has been trying to genuinely help. 16 years of India Afghan ties starting from 2011 after fall of Taliban has only growing. Speaking to DD News, India's ambassador to Afghanistan said \" modern content being given to age old ties\" India's helping hand to Afghanistan India has been given scholarship to Afghan students. Training being given to afghan forces. Large Infra projects have been taken like -India Afghanistan Friendship dam in Herat and Afghan Parliament. On connectivity front-India Afghan Air corridor is working well and plans are being worked to expand it to other Indian and Afghan cities. US wants a greater Indian role in Afghanistan. when US Defence secretary visits India he said \"we applaud India's invaluable contribution to Afghanistan and welcome further efforts to promote Afghanistan's democracy, stability and security. Our two countries recognise the threat that global terrorism poses to people throughout the world.\" India has been a force of peace in Afghanistan. US want allies to help it in one of the longest running wars. Clearly, India, Afghanistan and US have convergence in action and words. Something required in a world that is fast changing and increasingly becoming scary.",

      "text": "twitter BaFin President Felix Hufeld said: “Whatever the outcome of Brexit is going to be, it will cost a price, both for British consumers, as well as EU27 consumers.” Hufeld says EU regulators won’t tolerate “empty shells or letterbox models” from financial services in the EU post-Brexit. \nLONDON — Germany’s most senior financial regulator believes Brexit will push up the price of financial services in both the UK and Europe. \nFelix Hufeld, the President of German regulator BaFin, said at an event on Tuesday: “It is crystal clear in my mind that whatever the outcome of Brexit is going to be, it will cost a price, both for British consumers, as well as EU27 consumers. That is very clear.” \nHufeld said there is a “vast economic dependency” between UK and EU that will be disrupted by the pair’s “historic divorce.” \nHufeld said BaFin and other EU regulators would not tolerate “empty shells or letterbox models,” meaning banks will have to set up fully regulated, functioning subsidiaries in Europe post-Brexit. This must include independent processes and management oversight, as well as IT systems. \nThis will inevitably be costly. The Association of Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) estimated in June that a “hard” Brexit could cost UK banks €15 billion (£13.1 billion) and add €40 billion (£35 billion) to tier one capital requirements. \nThese costs would most likely push up the cost of services — everything from loans to insurance. Bruegel, a European economic think tank, estimated in February that Brexit could push up European borrowing costs by as much as €12 billion a year. \n“The cost of doing business will go up, certain costs for consumers may go up — it’s more difficult to predict precisely — but the assumption that it’s going to be a cost-free incident I find completely unrealistic,” Hufeld said. \n“It does show the degree of interaction and the benefits of being in the EU have been underestimated by many people. We all will pay a price for that.” \nAsked to estimate just how much Brexit may cost banks and other financial institutions, Hufeld said it is too early to tell. \nHe said he was in close communication with colleagues across Europe to ensure regulators are prepared for whatever the outcome of Brexit happens to be, saying his key goal was to ensure financial stability. \nHufeld was speaking in London at an event organised by specialist financial service consultancy Zeb.

I've got loads of heels at home.\" A post shared by Sam Smith (@samsmithworld) on Oct 16, 2017 at 5:09am PDT \nThe Stay with Me singer says that as a teenager, he dressed as his idols, Boy George and Marilyn Monroe. \n\"People don't know this, but when I was 17, I remember becoming obsessed with Boy George and Marilyn [Monroe], and all that,\" he quipped. \n\"There was a moment in my life where I didn't own a piece of male clothing, really. I would wear full make-up every day in school, eyelashes, leggings with Dr Martens and huge fur coats, for 2.5 years.\" A post shared by Sam Smith (@samsmithworld) on Oct 13, 2017 at 3:32am PDT \nSmith's latest album, The Thrill of It All , drops on November 3 and the singer thinks his new tracks encompass his \"growth\" and \"confidence.\" \n\"I feel like they show me. They show the gay guy I've become,\" he said. Singer Sam Smith at the Nova Red Room in Sydney.

      "text": "Clive ordered to pay up for appeal premium_icon Use this content by Melanie Petrinec \nFUGITIVE former Queensland Nickel boss Clive Mensink has been ordered to stump up $70,000 if he wants to go ahead with an appeal of two warrants for his arrest. \nMr Mensink appealed the arrest warrants soon after they were issued in March for failing to appear in court, and the taxpayer-funded liquidators of QN want him to provide security for costs of court ahead of time in case he loses the case. \nJustice Michael Wigney made an order this morning that Mr Mensink should pay $70,000 into the court, or provide to the registrar an unconditional guarantee from an Australian-owned bank. \nHe said there was a \"significant risk Mr Mensink will not comply with any adverse costs order that may be made against him\". \n\"The attitude that Mr Mensink has displayed to the court's orders, his continuing absence from Australia, and his apparent unwillingness to reveal his whereabouts are highly relevant in considering the risks that any order for costs against Mr Mensink will not be satisfied,\" Justice Wigney wrote in his judgement. \nBizarrely, Mr Mensink's lawyer and his uncle Clive Palmer say they have not heard from the globetrotting businessman for months - despite forging ahead with the appeal on his behalf. \nHe has been overseas since last June, and had claimed his planned return date was July 2017. \nBut according to Justice Wigney's judgement, QN's liquidators still don't know where he is. \nThis morning, Mr Palmer's loyal personal assistant Sarah Mole was scheduled to give evidence in the Federal Court. \nIt was adjourned at the last minute after the liquidators were provided with a folder of emails on behalf of Ms Mole. \nShe has previously given evidence about correspondence she received from Mr Mensink to arrange cruises.",

      "text": "OMAHA (DTN) -- Two different views of the oncoming 2017-18 winter season are making their way into discussion this week. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced its winter forecast Oct. 19. The NOAA forecast noted that the Pacific Ocean temperatures are likely to fall to La Nina levels during the rest of calendar year 2017, with a 55% to 65% chance of La Nina developing and being in effect through winter.\n\"Typical La Nina patterns during winter include above-average precipitation and colder-than-average temperatures along the northern tier of the U.S. and below-normal precipitation and drier conditions across the South,\" said NOAA Climate Prediction Center Deputy Director Mike Halpert in a news release.\nNOAA's U.S. winter precipitation forecast (December, January, February) calls for above-average amounts in the northern U.S., from the northern Rockies to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Drier-than-normal conditions are indicated across the entire southern U.S.\n NOAA's forecast also calls for warmer-than-normal conditions over the southern two-thirds of the U.S. and the entire East Coast. Below-average temperatures are favored along the northern tier of the contiguous U.S., from Minnesota to the Pacific Northwest. The rest of the country falls into an \"equal chance\" category for either above-, near- or below-normal temperatures.\nThe NOAA forecast wasn't the only forecast that has been posted, however. Private weather company forecasts are also being shared, and there are some differences with the public outlook, especially on temperatures.\nDTN's winter weather outlook has a broader expanse of colder-than-normal conditions than the NOAA forecast is indicating, with the influence of the polar vortex from the Arctic latitudes more pronounced, and adding to the impact of La Nina.\n\"There will be greater, periodic risks for Arctic cold when the polar vortex is displaced southward,\" DTN forecaster Jeff Johnson noted in prepared remarks for a winter outlook webinar.\nDTN's winter temperature forecast calls for a large portion of the north-central and northeastern U.S. -- instead of an \"equal chance\" temperature trend -- to have more cold periods during the '17-18 winter season. DTN's forecast also has the potential for an \"extended winter\" in the Midwest, meaning lower temperatures could linger into calendar year 2018. Along with that colder air, \"snowfall will be heavier than average in the Northwest, Upper Midwest, Great Lakes and Ohio Valley,\" the DTN presentation highlighted. The DTN forecast also calls for heavier precipitation in the Tennessee Valley region.\nThe NOAA outlook summary comments also noted the potential for the polar vortex influence to affect the winter 2017-18 weather pattern. However, such an event \"is difficult to predict more than one to two weeks in advance,\" said Halpert.\nBryce Anderson can be reached at bryce.anderson@dtn.com\nFollow Bryce Anderson on Twitter @BAndersonDTN",

      "text": "Women's soccer still has leg up: Kerr The potential to play at the Olympics and a FIFA World Cup gives soccer a leg up over rival codes for young females, according to Matildas star Sam Kerr.\nSoccer has two big advantages over rival codes competing for the interest of young female athletes, and Matildas star Sam Kerr isn't afraid to spruik them.\nThey are the Olympics and the FIFA Women's World Cup.\nThe 24-year-old believes those two showpiece tournaments alone should make the round-ball game the most enticing option for girls in the suddenly competitive women's sport market in Australia.\nThe female sporting sector has grown significantly in recent years, with a number of major bodies seeing it as a crucial way to grow their participation and fan rates.\nBoth AFL and cricket have introduced semi-professional domestic women's leagues in recent years, while the NRL has increased their focus on grassroots and the Australian Jillaroos.\nBut Kerr said soccer still maintained a distinct advantage for young females trying to get into a sport.\n\"We have one up on AFL and other sports like that,\" she said.\n\"We get to play worldwide and compete at the Olympics and World Cups, which other sports can't do.\n\"I don't think you can compete with it. I don't know: Playing in the AFL grand final or being in the Olympics? You can answer that question for me.\"\nKerr has quickly become the golden girl of women's soccer in Australia.\nIn the past week she has been named the USA's National Women Soccer League's MVP and Australia's Sportswoman of the Year.\nThose gongs now sit alongside the W-League MVP award she won at Perth Glory last season, who she re-signed for last month.\nThe forward's success for the Matildas has also helped take them to No.6 in the world, following their two defeats of Brazil on home soil last month.\nOn Monday she claimed the W-League was close to matching the USA's prestigious NWSL in terms of quality, and expected interest to rise significantly when its 10th season kicked off on Friday night, off the back of its first collective bargaining agreement and the Matildas' success.\n\"I think at the moment the league is in a really good place,\" Kerr said.\n\"We're taking steps forward and the Matildas' success has helped that a lot.\n\"It's a professional league where people have to live up to expectations. There's a lot of pressure with that but I think it's great.\"\nOne area where the W-League doesn't have it over their rivals yet is financially.\nDespite the signing of their historic first CBA this year, the $10,000 minimum payment for players per season is still well below that of Super Netball and cricket's domestic women's leagues, and only marginally above the AFLW competition.",

We have a plan and we’re sticking to it.” \nThe fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has helped McLaren’s overseas exports, he says. \nAbout 65% of the company’s product is exported, to Europe, North America and the rest of the world. \n‘We love Woking and we’re intending to stay there. We’re very much focussed on staying in the area and in the UK’, says Palmer.",

      "text": "Clive ordered to pay up for appeal premium_icon Use this content by Melanie Petrinec \nFUGITIVE former Queensland Nickel boss Clive Mensink has been ordered to stump up $70,000 if he wants to go ahead with an appeal of two warrants for his arrest. \nMr Mensink appealed the arrest warrants soon after they were issued in March for failing to appear in court, and the taxpayer-funded liquidators of QN want him to provide security for costs of court ahead of time in case he loses the case. \nJustice Michael Wigney made an order this morning that Mr Mensink should pay $70,000 into the court, or provide to the registrar an unconditional guarantee from an Australian-owned bank. \nHe said there was a \"significant risk Mr Mensink will not comply with any adverse costs order that may be made against him\". \n\"The attitude that Mr Mensink has displayed to the court's orders, his continuing absence from Australia, and his apparent unwillingness to reveal his whereabouts are highly relevant in considering the risks that any order for costs against Mr Mensink will not be satisfied,\" Justice Wigney wrote in his judgement. \nBizarrely, Mr Mensink's lawyer and his uncle Clive Palmer say they have not heard from the globetrotting businessman for months - despite forging ahead with the appeal on his behalf. \nHe has been overseas since last June, and had claimed his planned return date was July 2017. \nBut according to Justice Wigney's judgement, QN's liquidators still don't know where he is. \nThis morning, Mr Palmer's loyal personal assistant Sarah Mole was scheduled to give evidence in the Federal Court. \nIt was adjourned at the last minute after the liquidators were provided with a folder of emails on behalf of Ms Mole. \nShe has previously given evidence about correspondence she received from Mr Mensink to arrange cruises.",

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure North Korea when he visits China next month, a senior White House official said on Monday, stepping up a strategy to have Beijing help rein in Pyongyang. \nIsolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. \nTrump will call on Xi to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea. \nChina, North Korea’s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. \nChina has said it will strictly enforce UN Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles, and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. But a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump’s trip said China needs to do more to comply with two UN Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China’s support. \n“We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those UN Security Council resolutions,” the official said. \nThough China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. \nChina’s special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his US counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said, where they had a “deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue”. The ministry did not elaborate. \nTrump, who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nBut this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan. ‘Critical’ threat \nThe threat from North Korea has grown to a “critical and imminent level” and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his US and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday. \nOnodera’s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. \nThe White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff. \nAsked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a US envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said: “There’s nothing planned.” \nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for Trump his country’s efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program but also advised the US leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict. \n“There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary but so is dialogue. The US will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia to resolve the issue,” he said. \nWith Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week. \nTrump’s November 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. \nTrump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the US trade deficit with China, the White House official said. \n“We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,” the official said. \nDespite Trump’s fierce criticism of China’s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea. \nChina has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbour. \nEven as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to US demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang.

      "text": "Kentucky Chief Justice Renews Call For Judicial Redistricting, Pay Raises By Ryland Barton • 2 hours ago Originally published on October 20, 2017 3:20 pm \nThe chief justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court is renewing his call to lawmakers to redraw judicial boundaries in the state to ease caseloads in local courts. \nChief Justice John Minton said there is “urgent need” to redraw the boundaries of several judicial circuits where populations have shifted over the century — the last time the lines were changed. \n“It almost doesn’t bear to comment that the population of our state has redistributed, which has altered the workload demands of the courts needed to serve the local communities,” Minton said. \nHe said the current scheme leads to heavy caseloads in some circuits and “hampers the ability of the courts to serve all Kentuckians as well as we should.” \nMinton unveiled a plan late last year that would have added 16 family court judges across the state while eliminating 15 district and circuit court judges. \nThe plan would have taken effect in 2022 when all lower court judges would have been on the ballot. \nThe Senate passed the measure, but it was never taken up in the House. \nSen. John Schickel, a Republican from Union, said the legislature needs to act on some part of the redistricting plan during the upcoming legislative session. \n“In this age when we’re reducing pensions, I don’t think you can overstate the importance of this issue in a co-equal branch of government,” Schickel said. \nMinton singled out several circuits that he said needed new boundaries — the 28 th Circuit, including Lincoln, Rockcastle and Pulaski counties; 16 th Circuit, including Kenton County; 31 st Circuit, including Floyd County; 36 th Circuit, including Magoffin and Knott counties; the 14 th Circuit, including Bourbon, Scott and Woodford counties; and the 6 th Circuit, including Daviess County. \nHe also renewed his request for lawmakers to increase the salaries of judges, circuit clerks and non-elected employees. \n“As you can imagine, the lack of progress that I’ve been able to make on this issue has left our judges feeling discouraged and undervalued,” Minton said. \n“It also provides little incentive for the best and brightest attorneys to be willing to leave a lucrative law practice to become judges.” \nAbout 18 percent of the state’s 3,300 non-elected court employees earn less than the federal poverty limit for a family of four — $23,550 in Kentucky.

His termination notice alleges Cocking \"knowingly ingested... ice or methamphetamine\" on February 25 which led to him being charged with the serious assault of a nurse at the PA Hospital, court documents state. \nIt alleges this showed \"a significant lack of judgment and a fundamental departure from ADF and air force values and standards of behaviour\". \nSgt Cocking denies \"knowingly or intentionally\" ingesting \"any prohibited substance\" and told the court that he has a pathology report showing a test of urine \"did not detect any prohibited drugs\".",

His termination notice alleges Cocking \"knowingly ingested... ice or methamphetamine\" on February 25 which led to him being charged with the serious assault of a nurse at the PA Hospital, court documents state. \nIt alleges this showed \"a significant lack of judgment and a fundamental departure from ADF and air force values and standards of behaviour\". \nSgt Cocking denies \"knowingly or intentionally\" ingesting \"any prohibited substance\" and told the court that he has a pathology report showing a test of urine \"did not detect any prohibited drugs\".",

Traffic on the M1 is expected to be a nightmare during the Games. Picture: John Gass \nThe State Opposition believes Coast businesses are being asked to find travel solutions when the Government after three years fine tunes a traffic management plan. \n\"How will forcing staff to work longer hours over four days help local businesses during the Commonwealth Games and is this even legal under the relevant industrial awards,\" an Opposition insider told the Gold Coast Bulletin . \nThe Government was advised in an internal brief in November 2016 that the added Games traffic would to lead congestion on some sections of the M1 which could create a \"very high crash risk\". One of the key plans to reduce traffic issues during the Games is to get employees to work from home. Photo: Jodie Richter \nSouthport Chamber of Commerce president Laird Marshall wants more transport details for businesses. \n\"I think most businesses have no idea what the disruption will be. I'm not saying that in a negative way,\" Mr Marshall said. \n\"They just don't know how it will be. For a lot of businesses, if they change the time of people at work, it will cost a lot more. I don't think people realise that the streets will be blocked off (for events). \n\"Everyone knows about the M1. I haven't seen a plan of what definitely is going to happen yet.\"",

      "text": "Why the Kangaroos are the Death Star premium_icon by Nick Campton \nIN the grand scheme of things, whenever Australia lose it's good for international rugby league. \nThe Kangaroos are the colossus of Test football. In the last 10 years they've lost to New Zealand five times, drew with them once and beaten everybody else they've played, accumulating a 39-5-1 record against all opposition. \nSince Great Britain beat Australia 23-12 in the 2006 Tri Nations, the closest the Poms have come to beating the Kangaroos was a 16-12 defeat in the 2014 Four Nations. In the 21st century, Great Britain/England have three wins against Australia from 24 attempts. \nFrance are the only other team to have ever beaten Australia and the last time they did that was in 1978. The French lost 52-30 to Australia in 2004 and that match is the closest any tier two nation has come to beating Australia in the last 20 years. \nTEAMS: Who will play in week one? \nThe Kangaroos deserve a lot of credit for their continued supremacy, especially over the last 18 months after it looked like New Zealand had well and truly overtaken them in 2014-15. \nBut Australia, as good as they may be, are the schoolyard bullies. They're the big men on campus, the unstoppable force, the Death Star, the favourites in every game they play and every game they have played in the last 20 years. \nThey're the prohibitive favourites for this World Cup and it would take something truly shocking for anyone else to get the prize. But if someone else did, if New Zealand or England or Tonga could somehow claw their way past the green and gold juggernaut, it would give international rugby league a serious shot in the arm. \nIt's no coincidence that New Zealand's 24-0 thumping in the 2005 Tri Nations final was followed by victories in the 2008 World Cup, the 2010 Four Nations and the 2014 Four Nations. No one Kiwi player appeared in all four matches, it was a true generational shift. Australia romped to victory in the 2013 World Cup. \nAnother New Zealand win would be a boost, but an England World Cup win could be one of the greatest moments in that country's rugby league history. \nRugby league in England is in a tough spot. It has the history and the tradition and the fanatical support in the north but the clubs are perennially short of cash and the struggle to move beyond the game's birthplace has been tough. \nThe Test side hasn't won a tournament since 1972 and even then it was on a count back. They haven't made a World Cup final since 1995. It has been a tough few decades for the Lions, first as Great Britain and then as England. \nA win would give the game in the UK some much needed wider exposure and provide success-starved England sports fans some desperately needed glory. It would be the kind of win the fans would remember for the rest of their lives. \nNew Zealand footy people will talk about the 2008 World Cup final for as long as the game is played. The haka before the match, Billy Slater's gaffe that lead to Benji Marshall's try, the decisive penalty try to Lance Hohaia, the match-sealing score to Adam Blair, the scenes afterwards - they're iconic images of New Zealand rugby league. Australia are again the warm favourites. \nAnd if Tonga somehow, someway, manage to win it all? Forget about it. \nIt would be the greatest day in international rugby league history. Jason Taumalolo would become an all-time footballing legend. They would rename islands after him. \nIf Australia win, and they probably will, its just one more tournament victory. \nAnother win among many. Special and unique in its own way without a doubt, but without the singular significance of an England or New Zealand victory. \nThat's not to denigrate the achievements of the Kangaroos by any means. \nThe team that romped to victory in the 2013 tournament was among the finest ever to leave these shores. This time around there's a truly fascinating mix of the old guard and the new generation - Mal Meninga's squad has a fun mix of grizzled veterans and hungry youngsters. \nThe likes of Cameron Munster, Michael Morgan and Tom Trbojevic making their mark on the Test arena is a recipe for a good time and the return of Billy Slater promises to be a treat. Most of the Kangaroos recent losses have come without Johnathan Thurston. \nThis will also be the final time we see Slater, Cameron Smith and Cooper Cronk all play together, a gift many fans won't appreciate until its over. \nAustralia will play some brilliant football on their way to a probable victory, and no matter the result they'll be appointment viewing because they are the best in the world. \nBut things are better for Test footy when they lose. Mal Meninga is one of Test football's champions, a true believer in the importance of the international game. \nIronically, the best thing he could do for Test footy would be to fail.",

      "text": "twitter BaFin President Felix Hufeld said: “Whatever the outcome of Brexit is going to be, it will cost a price, both for British consumers, as well as EU27 consumers.” Hufeld says EU regulators won’t tolerate “empty shells or letterbox models” from financial services in the EU post-Brexit. \nLONDON — Germany’s most senior financial regulator believes Brexit will push up the price of financial services in both the UK and Europe. \nFelix Hufeld, the President of German regulator BaFin, said at an event on Tuesday: “It is crystal clear in my mind that whatever the outcome of Brexit is going to be, it will cost a price, both for British consumers, as well as EU27 consumers. That is very clear.” \nHufeld said there is a “vast economic dependency” between UK and EU that will be disrupted by the pair’s “historic divorce.” \nHufeld said BaFin and other EU regulators would not tolerate “empty shells or letterbox models,” meaning banks will have to set up fully regulated, functioning subsidiaries in Europe post-Brexit. This must include independent processes and management oversight, as well as IT systems. \nThis will inevitably be costly. The Association of Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) estimated in June that a “hard” Brexit could cost UK banks €15 billion (£13.1 billion) and add €40 billion (£35 billion) to tier one capital requirements. \nThese costs would most likely push up the cost of services — everything from loans to insurance. Bruegel, a European economic think tank, estimated in February that Brexit could push up European borrowing costs by as much as €12 billion a year. \n“The cost of doing business will go up, certain costs for consumers may go up — it’s more difficult to predict precisely — but the assumption that it’s going to be a cost-free incident I find completely unrealistic,” Hufeld said. \n“It does show the degree of interaction and the benefits of being in the EU have been underestimated by many people. We all will pay a price for that.” \nAsked to estimate just how much Brexit may cost banks and other financial institutions, Hufeld said it is too early to tell. \nHe said he was in close communication with colleagues across Europe to ensure regulators are prepared for whatever the outcome of Brexit happens to be, saying his key goal was to ensure financial stability. \nHufeld was speaking in London at an event organised by specialist financial service consultancy Zeb.

Fedpol. Photo: Andrew Meares  Photo: Andrew Meares And two weeks after those hearings, the court will rule on Friday at 2.15pm on Mr Joyce's fate, and that of six senators: Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash, former Nationals cabinet minister Matt Canavan, former Greens senators Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam, One Nation's Malcolm Roberts and NXT leader Nick Xenophon.\nIf a byelection is ordered in Mr Joyce's northern NSW seat of New England, the earliest the poll can be held is December 2.\nAs the only lower house MP, and with the Turnbull government holding just 76 seats in the 150-member lower house, it is Mr Joyce's case the government is most concerned about, although independent MP Cathy McGowan said on Tuesday that she would continue to support the government, which gives the Coalition some breathing room.\nFairfax Media spoke to half a dozen Nationals MPs on Tuesday and the prevailing view was that Mr Joyce, who referred himself to the Court in August when he learnt he was a New Zealander by descent through his father James, is that a byelection is increasingly likely.\nAdvertisement \"That fact that it has taken so long for the court to make its ruling doesn't bode well,\" one MP, who asked not to be named, said, \"and all sorts of theories are sweeping the place.\"\n\"Let's get through to Friday and see what happens,\" said another MP. \"The fact it has taken two weeks is a worry. Confidence has been eaten away as the days have gone by.\"\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly said that, based on the advice of the Solicitor-General, \"We are very, very confident that our members who have been caught up in this will be held by the court to be eligible to sit in the Parliament and therefore eligible to be ministers.\"\nB ut another Nationals source said that the two-week delay in the ruling could favour Mr Joyce as a \"black letter law\" decision against the Nationals leader would likely have been made quickly.\nWhile confidence is falling in government ranks that the court will rule favourably for Mr Joyce, to a person Nationals MPs believe Mr Joyce would win a byelection that could feature a Melbourne Cup field of candidates from Labor, One Nation, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, and possibly former New England independent and political foe Tony Windsor.\nIf Mr Joyce loses his seat, Nationals Senate leader Nigel Scullion is the next in line to take over by dint of seniority, even though he is in the upper house and the Coalition will likely face at least one sitting week without Mr Joyce as lower house leader.\nInfrastructure Minister Darren Chester and Small Business Minister Michael McCormack are both seen as future leaders of the Nationals and are in the lower house.\nABC psephologist Antony Green told Fairfax Media that December 2 was the most likely date should a byelection be ordered, but December 9 was possible if a Queensland state election was called for November 25.",

SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link British Airways has apologised after at least three passengers reported walking off an overnight flight from Vancouver covered in red welts. Photo: AP \nSo she rang the bell and informed a flight attendant - quietly, lest she alarm her 7-year-old daughter or the passenger into whose seat back the thing had disappeared - that British Airways Flight 84 might have a bedbug problem. \n\"The flight attendant said, 'We don't have anywhere to move you. I'm really sorry',\" Szilagyi said. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Passenger Heather Szilagyi used to clean hotel rooms, she said, so knows a bedbug when she sees one. Photo: Piotr Naskrecik \nNow British Airways says it's sorry, too. The airline apologised in a statement to CTV News after Szilagyi, her daughter and at least one other passenger reported walking off the nine-hour flight from Vancouver covered in red welts. \nSzilagyi used to clean hotel rooms, she said, and so knows a bedbug when she sees one. She and daughter Molly are allergic to them, but Szilagyi tried to stay optimistic on the October 10 flight. Advertisement \nAs the cabin lights dimmed and Molly drifted off to sleep, Szilagyi tried to convince herself that the bedbug that crawled out of her TV was a random stray - perhaps left there by some unfortunate passenger before her.

By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nLikewise, when she looked down from her dinner tray a bit later, she said, she hoped it was just a flax seed that lay in her lap. \nBut seeds don't move. \n\"This one I grabbed and squished in Kleenex,\" Szilagyi said. Then she rang the bell again. \nThe flight attendant thanked her and took the insect away as if it were just a discarded coffee cup, she recalled. Then Szilagyi spotted two more bugs and debated in whispers with her fiance whether to risk a panic by alerting the other passengers. \n\"I knew it was a real infestation,\" she said. \"But we didn't want to ruin someone else's trip, and there's nothing they could do anyway.\" \nSo Szilagyi drank two glasses of wine, closed her eyes and tried her best to accept the inevitable. \nCome daylight and the end of the flight, she said, she saw bites on Molly thighs. The family had travelled to Europe for a funeral but spent their first night on the continent throwing pillows in a hotel dishwasher and soaking their clothes in scalding water. \n\"The next morning, me and Molly were just covered in bites,\" Szilagyi said. \nOver the next week, she said, her daughter's welts became infected and bled. Szilagyi said she and her fiance spent much of the trip on hold with British Airways, in a fruitless effort to ensure they didn't share the flight home with yet more bedbugs. \nThe couple finally started posting proof of their suffering on Twitter, which resulted in British tabloid headlines such as: \"JUST PLANE AWFUL: Furious mum slams British Airways after daughter, 7, was ravaged by BED BUGS and left bleeding on flight.\" \n\"How embarrassing is that, to be known for this?\" Szilagyi said. But her fury had some effect. \nShe said British Airways representatives met her family at the airport as they left London. They got a promise to fumigate better and a free seat upgrade - neither quite guarantees against bedbugs. \n\"It doesn't matter what class you're in, you're still going to get bugs,\" Szilagyi noted. But the flight back to Vancouver turned out insect-free, as far as she knows, and the carrier has since been conciliatory. \n\"We have been in touch with our customer to apologise and investigate further,\" the airline wrote in a statement to CTV News last week. \"British Airways operates more than 280,000 flights every year, and reports of bed bugs onboard are extremely rare.\" \nNot rare enough for some. The airline had at least one bedbug incident last year, which resulted in a plane being pulled from service. \nAnd on Friday, another passenger on Szilagyi's flight told Global News that he left the plane with bites across his back and has since thrown out his clothes. \nThe Washington Post",

      "text": "Women's soccer still has leg up: Kerr The potential to play at the Olympics and a FIFA World Cup gives soccer a leg up over rival codes for young females, according to Matildas star Sam Kerr.\nSoccer has two big advantages over rival codes competing for the interest of young female athletes, and Matildas star Sam Kerr isn't afraid to spruik them.\nThey are the Olympics and the FIFA Women's World Cup.\nThe 24-year-old believes those two showpiece tournaments alone should make the round-ball game the most enticing option for girls in the suddenly competitive women's sport market in Australia.\nThe female sporting sector has grown significantly in recent years, with a number of major bodies seeing it as a crucial way to grow their participation and fan rates.\nBoth AFL and cricket have introduced semi-professional domestic women's leagues in recent years, while the NRL has increased their focus on grassroots and the Australian Jillaroos.\nBut Kerr said soccer still maintained a distinct advantage for young females trying to get into a sport.\n\"We have one up on AFL and other sports like that,\" she said.\n\"We get to play worldwide and compete at the Olympics and World Cups, which other sports can't do.\n\"I don't think you can compete with it. I don't know: Playing in the AFL grand final or being in the Olympics? You can answer that question for me.\"\nKerr has quickly become the golden girl of women's soccer in Australia.\nIn the past week she has been named the USA's National Women Soccer League's MVP and Australia's Sportswoman of the Year.\nThose gongs now sit alongside the W-League MVP award she won at Perth Glory last season, who she re-signed for last month.\nThe forward's success for the Matildas has also helped take them to No.6 in the world, following their two defeats of Brazil on home soil last month.\nOn Monday she claimed the W-League was close to matching the USA's prestigious NWSL in terms of quality, and expected interest to rise significantly when its 10th season kicked off on Friday night, off the back of its first collective bargaining agreement and the Matildas' success.\n\"I think at the moment the league is in a really good place,\" Kerr said.\n\"We're taking steps forward and the Matildas' success has helped that a lot.\n\"It's a professional league where people have to live up to expectations. There's a lot of pressure with that but I think it's great.\"\nOne area where the W-League doesn't have it over their rivals yet is financially.\nDespite the signing of their historic first CBA this year, the $10,000 minimum payment for players per season is still well below that of Super Netball and cricket's domestic women's leagues, and only marginally above the AFLW competition.",

We have a plan and we’re sticking to it.” \nThe fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has helped McLaren’s overseas exports, he says. \nAbout 65% of the company’s product is exported, to Europe, North America and the rest of the world. \n‘We love Woking and we’re intending to stay there. We’re very much focussed on staying in the area and in the UK’, says Palmer.",

      "text": "Seniors benefit as Commonwealth Bank removes mortgage fee 24th Oct 2017 12:00 PM FEE SAVING: This week's Commonwealth Bank announcement will be a welcome saving for Seniors with one less bank fee to worry about. Tyrone Branigan / Commonwealth Bank by Seniors News \nTHE Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced this week the removal of its reverse mortgage product monthly fee. \nCustomers will be advised of the immediate removal of the Equity Unlock for Seniors product monthly account fee of $12 when they next receive an account statement. \nThe EQFS product, or reverse mortgage, is set up for older Australians aged 65 and over to access the equity in their home to supplement their income. \nA reverse mortgage product is a loan which doesn't require repayments. The monthly fees are debited to the loan account, but the borrower doesn't have to make regular repayments. However, the interest and product fees compound on the loan so the balance can increase significantly. It has to be repaid when the borrower sells the house or dies. \nThe loan is often used for a variety of personal expenses including home maintenance or renovations, or medical treatment. \nThe Commonwealth has more than 12,000 seniors who are currently accessing its EQFS. \nThe bank found from its customer feedback that concerns over this account fee are raised more often than many other home lending products. \nThe Commonwealth's executive general manager of Home Buying Dan Huggins announced the bank is removing the fee to make the accounts more affordable for seniors. \n\"We know that seniors using this product often find the fees difficult, which is why we've listened and taken action,\" Mr Huggins said. \n\"Many of these customers are seniors enjoying their well-earned retirement and we believe that removing extra costs like this from their budgets will be warmly welcomed.\" \nNational Seniors chief executive Dagmar Parsons said many seniors wanted to remain in the homes and communities where they'd raised their families, and reverse mortgages were one way they could access the equity in their house to help fund their retirement lifestyle and aged care support services without selling up and moving. \n\"We know many older people are reluctant to leave the homes they've lived in for years and sometimes decades,\" Ms Parsons said. \n\"We support moves like this one that will assist them to stay in familiar surrounds in comfort, rather than being asset-rich and cash poor. \n\"We encourage other providers with similar fees to get rid of them, too.\"",

      "text": "David Thorpe | 24 October 2017 \nThe European Union could be set to define energy efficient buildings as “nearly energy zero” if the definition, proposed last week by the European Parliament’s Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) Committee, is adopted into law. \nThe Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who form the committee have issued a radical new draft for the ongoing revision of the bloc’s Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), and then voted 51-1 in favour of it on 11 October. \nThe directive revision forms part of the European Commission’s Clean Energy Package . Nearly zero-energy buildings \nThe new draft includes a much more robust set of proposals than the old one, asserting that “it is vital that the existing building stock” become “highly energy efficient and decarbonised up to nearly zero-energy standard by 2050”. \nThis definition of energy performance is credited to Danish centre-right lawmaker Bendt Bendtsen, who had brokered an amendment that defines decarbonised building stock as “building stock performing to Nearly Zero-Energy Building (nZEB) level”. Bendt Bendsten, Danish Christian Democrat Member of the European Parliament \nCurrently, only one per cent of new construction is nZEB, despite the fact that the current Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires all new buildings to be nearly zero-energy by the end of 2020 and all new public buildings to be nearly zero-energy by 2018. Promoting investment in buildings \nThe draft amendments go on to say that European nations should “seek a cost-efficient equilibrium between decarbonising energy supplies and reducing final energy consumption” by giving investors “a clear vision to guide their policies and investment decisions”. \nThis would include “well-defined national milestones and actions for energy efficiency to achieve the short-term (2030), mid-term (2040) and long-term (2050) objectives”. \nThe annual renovation rates for Europe’s buildings need to improve dramatically from the current rates of 0.4 to 1.2 per cent, depending on the member state. Almost 50 per cent of the European Union’s final energy is used for heating and cooling, of which 80 per cent is used in buildings. \nBendtsen told the website EURACTIV.com , “Public money does not solve everything. Private investors need security and energy efficiency projects offer that.” Monica Frassoni, president of the European Alliance to Save Energy \nMonica Frassoni, president of the European Alliance to Save Energy said the ITRE vote counterbalanced the weak approach of the Energy Council and “set a reliable and coherent framework to attract investments in the building sector”. She went on to call for investments to scale up “to an unprecedented level”. National roadmaps \nThe new draft calls for member states to “establish a long-term renovation strategy for mobilising investment in renovation” of all types of buildings “with the aim of encouraging and guiding the transformation of the building stock into a highly energy efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050”. \nMember states will be required to produce national roadmaps and strategies for attaining milestones along their decarbonisation roads. Over 75 per cent of Europe’s building stock is presently classed as inefficient, so there is plenty to do. \nThe European Council of the Ministers had sought to take a more general approach than this, and reduce the ambition of the Commission’s proposal, but the new amendments go much further and call upon member states to offer clear guidelines and measurable, targeted actions for especially improving the worst performing segments of the national building stock, for energy-poor consumers, for social housing and for households that suffer from so-called split-incentive dilemmas. \nStates should also set requirements for a certain level of energy performance for rental properties, the new draft says. Job creation \nThe MEPs have their eye upon the potential for this to create jobs. They point out that “ambitious goals for deep renovation of the existing building stock will create millions of jobs in the Union, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises”. \nTherefore nations should set out “initiatives to promote skills development and education in the construction and energy efficiency sectors”. Building with timber \nFor the first time, an EU document has also acknowledged the value of building in timber to sequester atmospheric carbon in the body of a building. \nOne of the amendments reads: “When the energy use [of a building] will be brought closer to zero, then the share of embodied energy will be more decisive in the whole lifecycle of the building. The future vision for a decarbonised building stock should include the embodied energy in buildings. Therefore building with wood is positive for the climate.” \nThe value of planting trees to create regenerative cities is also stated: “Nature-based solutions, such as well-designed street vegetation, green roofs and walls providing insulation and shade to buildings, reduce energy demand by limiting the need for heating and cooling and improving a building’s energy performance.” Indoor air quality \nThe list of valuable amendments doesn’t stop there. Last month the EU’s environment committee’s MEPs sought to encourage more attention on indoor air quality. As a result the draft quotes World Health Organisation guidelines , which state that better-performing buildings provide higher comfort levels and wellbeing for their occupants and improve health. \nThe draft calls for energy performance upgrades of existing buildings to “contribute to achieving a healthy indoor environment”. \nIt then identifies the sources of ill-health: \n“Thermal bridges, inadequate insulation and unplanned air pathways can result in surface temperatures below the dew point of the air and in dampness. It is therefore essential to ensure a complete and homogeneous insulation of the building including balconies, fenestrations, roofs, walls, doors and floor.” Trigger points \nBendtsen’s amendment to the European Commission’s proposal includes the setting of “trigger points” when a building’s energy efficiency would be improved. \nA trigger point “means an opportune moment, for example from a cost-effectiveness, cost-efficiency or disruption perspective, in the lifecycle of a building for carrying out energy efficiency renovations”. \nTrigger points include whenever a renovation is conducted for another reason, such as for an emergency, scheduled purposes, or as part of an agreement between tenants. Buildings to have their own passports \nNo, this doesn’t mean that buildings might travel. It means that each one can have its own plan for how it will become more efficient up to 2050. \nTo this end yet another amendment from the ITRE calls for the European Commission to conclude a feasibility study by 2020 “on the possibilities and timeline to introduce a building renovation passport, perhaps as part of the recommendations section of the energy performance certificates, to provide a long-term, step-by-step renovation roadmap for a specific building”. \nThis will be based on quality criteria and follow an energy audit, and outline relevant measures and renovations that would improve the energy performance of a specific building. Electric vehicles \nThe Commission said the EPBD could support the introduction of electric vehicles, by requiring that all non-residential buildings install a charging point for every tenth parking space provided. \nThe Committee, however, wanted the EPBD to focus mostly on building renovation and believed that it should not be used to regulate transport policy. Rather, electric transport should be supported in its own legislative actions. The new report states that non-residential buildings should install pre-tubing for electric charging points, rather than full charging infrastructure. Next steps \nThe ITRE vote on 11 October secured backing from across party groups in the Parliament, with 51 votes in favour, 1 against and 11 abstentions. \nThis new draft will move for discussion and vote in Plenary at the end of October. If approved, the legislation should move to trialogue discussion in early November. \nThe current Estonian presidency hopes to reach a resolution by the end of its mandate on 31 December.",

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure North Korea when he visits China next month, a senior White House official said on Monday, stepping up a strategy to have Beijing help rein in Pyongyang. \nIsolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. \nTrump will call on Xi to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea. \nChina, North Korea’s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. \nChina has said it will strictly enforce UN Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles, and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. But a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump’s trip said China needs to do more to comply with two UN Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China’s support. \n“We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those UN Security Council resolutions,” the official said. \nThough China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. \nChina’s special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his US counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said, where they had a “deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue”. The ministry did not elaborate. \nTrump, who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nBut this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan. ‘Critical’ threat \nThe threat from North Korea has grown to a “critical and imminent level” and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his US and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday. \nOnodera’s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. \nThe White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff. \nAsked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a US envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said: “There’s nothing planned.” \nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for Trump his country’s efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program but also advised the US leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict. \n“There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary but so is dialogue. The US will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia to resolve the issue,” he said. \nWith Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week. \nTrump’s November 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. \nTrump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the US trade deficit with China, the White House official said. \n“We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,” the official said. \nDespite Trump’s fierce criticism of China’s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea. \nChina has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbour. \nEven as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to US demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang.

      "text": "Use this content by Paul Weston \nGOLD Coast bosses are officially being told to reduce the working days of staff, make them cycle or walk to work and be flexible with business hours during the Commonwealth Games. \nA \"Rethink your travel\" guide is being launched for Coast employers which encourages them to undertake dramatic changes to their workplaces during the event next April. \nBacked by the State Government, council and GOLDOC, the travel guide wants bosses to ensure their Coast employees reduce their travel during peak times. \nThe guide which includes the photograph of an athlete on the starting line for a race has been placed in major newspapers. \nThe key travel tips for employers include: \n. enable staff to work from other offices or home. \n. ensure staff work compressed weeks, reducing five days into four. \n. encourage employees to walk, cycle or catch public transport to work. \n. schedule meetings and conferences either before the Games or after. \n. adjust your opening hours to encourage travel outside of peak times. Traffic on the M1 is expected to be a nightmare during the Games. Picture: John Gass \nThe State Opposition believes Coast businesses are being asked to find travel solutions when the Government after three years fine tunes a traffic management plan. \n\"How will forcing staff to work longer hours over four days help local businesses during the Commonwealth Games and is this even legal under the relevant industrial awards,\" an Opposition insider told the Gold Coast Bulletin . \nThe Government was advised in an internal brief in November 2016 that the added Games traffic would to lead congestion on some sections of the M1 which could create a \"very high crash risk\". One of the key plans to reduce traffic issues during the Games is to get employees to work from home. Photo: Jodie Richter \nSouthport Chamber of Commerce president Laird Marshall wants more transport details for businesses. \n\"I think most businesses have no idea what the disruption will be. I'm not saying that in a negative way,\" Mr Marshall said. \n\"They just don't know how it will be. For a lot of businesses, if they change the time of people at work, it will cost a lot more. I don't think people realise that the streets will be blocked off (for events). \n\"Everyone knows about the M1. I haven't seen a plan of what definitely is going to happen yet.\"",

      "text": "Use this content by Paul Weston \nGOLD Coast bosses are officially being told to reduce the working days of staff, make them cycle or walk to work and be flexible with business hours during the Commonwealth Games. \nA \"Rethink your travel\" guide is being launched for Coast employers which encourages them to undertake dramatic changes to their workplaces during the event next April. \nBacked by the State Government, council and GOLDOC, the travel guide wants bosses to ensure their Coast employees reduce their travel during peak times. \nThe guide which includes the photograph of an athlete on the starting line for a race has been placed in major newspapers. \nThe key travel tips for employers include: \n. enable staff to work from other offices or home. \n. ensure staff work compressed weeks, reducing five days into four. \n. encourage employees to walk, cycle or catch public transport to work. \n. schedule meetings and conferences either before the Games or after. \n. adjust your opening hours to encourage travel outside of peak times. Traffic on the M1 is expected to be a nightmare during the Games. Picture: John Gass \nThe State Opposition believes Coast businesses are being asked to find travel solutions when the Government after three years fine tunes a traffic management plan. \n\"How will forcing staff to work longer hours over four days help local businesses during the Commonwealth Games and is this even legal under the relevant industrial awards,\" an Opposition insider told the Gold Coast Bulletin . \nThe Government was advised in an internal brief in November 2016 that the added Games traffic would to lead congestion on some sections of the M1 which could create a \"very high crash risk\". One of the key plans to reduce traffic issues during the Games is to get employees to work from home. Photo: Jodie Richter \nSouthport Chamber of Commerce president Laird Marshall wants more transport details for businesses. \n\"I think most businesses have no idea what the disruption will be. I'm not saying that in a negative way,\" Mr Marshall said. \n\"They just don't know how it will be. For a lot of businesses, if they change the time of people at work, it will cost a lot more. I don't think people realise that the streets will be blocked off (for events). \n\"Everyone knows about the M1. I haven't seen a plan of what definitely is going to happen yet.\"",

      "text": "Luxembourg Says Punishing City of London After Brexit Would Harm EU October 24, 2017 Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna looks on as he takes part in a plenary session during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, on Jan. 18, 2016. (REUTERS/Bobby Yip) LONDON–The City of London must remain the top global financial center after Brexit to avoid its financial services drifting to other parts of the world, Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna said on Monday. Financial centers such as Luxembourg, Paris and Frankfurt are battling each other to attract banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain who need an EU base after the UK departs the bloc in 2019. Companies from across the EU use London for currency trading, derivatives and managing investment funds. Some EU policymakers want parts of these activities shifted to the continent after Brexit to avoid relying on what will then be a foreign financial center. “It’s key for Europe … that the Number 1 financial center in the world remains in Europe,” Gramegna told students at the London School of Economics. There was a need to harness the City of London to Europe to ensure that London continued to perform well, Gramegna said. \nPunishing London to get a “chunk” of the pie was a very short-term view, and a “no deal” Brexit would not benefit the EU, but send UK financial services to countries outside Europe, Gramegna said. \nBritain would then, in a sense, drift away into the Atlantic, he added. “I find that a balanced final agreement with the UK, specifically for financial services, is in the interests of Europe itself,” Gramegna said. Britain and the EU have held several meetings to agree a divorce settlement, with too little progress to begin talks on future trading relations. Gramegna declined to put a figure on Britain’s divorce bill, a key stumbling block. “What is the value of access to the EU single market? Can you put a figure on that? I cannot. Money is really not what’s the most important,” he said. As regards Britain’s future trading relations with the EU, he said Switzerland has shown how it could work when it comes to the free movement of people, which many Britons want to curb. He urged British and EU politicians to “dedramatise” the divorce talks, avoid megaphone diplomacy, and focus on the factual. “We must be neither complacent, nor try to punish the UK,” he said. Having no trading deal would be bad for both sides. A transition period between Brexit and new trading terms was needed to reassure business, he said. “The pressure on companies is much higher than what governments anticipated,” he said. \nFinancial technology firms in London, for example, have already met with Luxembourg, saying they need access to EU customers after Brexit. \n“This is much more of an urgent matter than people think,” Gramegna said. \nReuters",

      "text": "More than 6.5 million people in UK never carry any gadgets with them Share More than 6.5 million Brits do not carry any gadgets with them whatsoever – 1 in 5 would welcome manufacturers introducing gadget usage limits on devices More than 1 in 10 would be happy to have designated tech-free time allocations day to day \nWhile a huge proportion of the nation has become extremely reliant on technology, a diehard pocket of technophobes are still managing to resist the lure of being connected 24/7 and are continuing to shun carrying gadgets with them day to day. \nA survey of 1,000 UK adults carried out by online vape shop, ElectricTobacconist.co.uk , has revealed more than 6.5 million people still go through daily life without carrying a single piece of technology on their person. \nPerhaps not surprisingly it’s the older generations which are more likely to do this, with 1 in 4 of those aged 65+ years confessing they don’t carry a single gadget with them. \nHowever, it’s not just old folk. Over 1 in 10 of those aged 46 – 54 will also do it – suggesting that this trend is not exclusive to pensioners. \nAnd while younger British adults are not as keen to live out daily life without the help of a gadget – with less than 1% of those aged 18 – 24 years going without on a daily basis – the research did reveal a surprising appetite to introduce functionality on their devices that restricted their usage. \nFor example, 1 in 5 (20%) said they would like to see manufacturers introducing features that would send them reminders not to over use their technology, or set usage limits. \nMeanwhile, 13% say they would be open to having allocated times during the day when they would go technology free. \nDigital detoxes are proving increasingly popular, with a number of Millennial A-listers having undertaken them – including 21 year old supermodel and Kardashian dynasty member, Kendal Jenner; 25 year old singer and Disney actress, Selena Gomez and songwriter, Ed Sheeran. \nSays Pascal Culverhouse, founder and CEO at ElectricTobacconist.co.uk : “Technology has come on to such a degree that it is now more shocking to find out that someone does not carry any gadgets with them at all, than for someone to reveal several hundred pounds’ worth of technology with them every day. \n“Technology is incredible, and allows us to achieve so many things in our day-to-day lives much more efficiently – but there is such a thing as over-use. Being permanently glued to a screen on a mobile phone or a tablet, for example, is not a good thing. It’s interesting to see that it has gone so far this way that many now admit they would like manufacturers to introduce features that make it more difficult in fact for them to use their devices – with many welcoming caps that will physically present them from using their gadgets.” \nBritish adults who don’t carry any gadgets with them (by age group): \n3% of 35 – 44 year olds \n10% of 46 – 54 year olds \n14% 55 – 64 year olds \n24% of 65+ year olds \nTo view the UK Gadget Usage Report 2017 and for more information on this research, visit https://www.electrictobacconist.co.uk/uk-gadget-usage-report-2017-i276",

Picture: AAP The earliest the by-election could be held is December 2, which will leave the Coalition without its one-seat majority for at least one sitting week.\nChief Justice Susan Kiefel had acknowledged there was public interest in making a ruling as soon as possible at the close of a three-day High Court hearing in Canberra earlier this month.\nThe High Court will also rule on the dual citizenship cases of Nationals senators Matt Canavan and Fiona Nash, Greens senators Scott Ludlum and Larissa Waters, independent Nick Xenophon and One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts on Friday.\nmedia_camera The “citizenship seven” will know their fate on Friday. Picture: AAP Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue argued the government’s case that only Senator Roberts and Mr Ludlum should be disqualified from Parliament during the three-day hearing.\nThe saga was sparked in July by Mr Ludlum’s resignation for holding New Zealand citizenship.\nHe was quickly followed by Ms Waters, who revealed she also held Canadian citizenship.\nSenator Canavan was then the first high profile government member to announce he might also have questions over his citizenship status.\nHe stepped aside from Mr Turnbull’s frontbench while the High Court decided the case.\nMr Joyce then made the bombshell announcement that he might be a New Zealand citizen in August, sparking intense scrutiny of dozens of other MPs who could be dual citizens.\nSenators Roberts, Nash and Xenophon were then referred to the High Court as well.\nOriginally published as Citizenship chaos not over yet",

SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Off to the final: Adelaide coach Marco Kurz (right) celebrates with his players after victory over the Wanderers. \nA stunning long-range strike by Adelaide midfielder Daniel Adlung separated the two sides as the Reds remained on course to become the first team to win two FFA Cups, having lifted the trophy in the inaugural tournament in 2014. \nThey were gifted the opener in the 13th minute, when a miss-kick by Wanderers defender Jonathan Aspropotamitis was pounced upon by Johan Absolonsen. Adelaide's Danish midfielder calmly slotted the ball past goalkeeper Vedran Janjetovic to give the Reds an early lead. Related Articles Brillante finish: Sydney FC snatch dramatic draw against Wanderers \nThe Wanderers' frustration was summed up when Roly Bonevacia was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card when he raked his studs down the leg of Adelaide's Isaias Sanchez. The Spaniard returned serve with a heavy challenge on Bonevacia seconds later to follow him into the book. Fortune smiled on Aspropotamitis on what was a difficult night for the promising youngster. Having already been cautioned, he was lucky to finish the first half after a clumsy, late challenge wasn't punished with anything further than a foul. \nAt the other end, Western Sydney's best chances came from distance while they nearly snuck an equaliser in the dying seconds of the first half when Oriol Riera's header from deep came close to looping into the far corner.

Matt Cardy Share on twitter by Myriam Robin In Cairns last Friday, an attempt to coax ageing rocker Sir Bob Geldof to play a tune for attendees of the 40th annual Property Congress resulted in the Live Aid founder dramatically exiting the stage, midway through an interview with ex- 60 Minutes journo-turned-corporate affairs adviser Tracey Curro.\n\"We scoured around Cairns to see if we could find a Gibson guitar — I don't think we found a Gibson, but we did find a guitar and given you have recently been on stage and music is what defines you, I wondered whether you could indulge us,\" Curro asked.\nTo which the answer was, well, a definitive \"no\".\n\"I am not going to indulge you because it's naff,\" said Sir Bob, a reliably colourful regular on the corporate speaking circuit. \"I do my things for a band. Why do you think I spent fucking hundreds of thousands in a studio — it's like asking Strauss, 'Do you think I can just knock one off?' … No … goodbye!!\"\nTo which he stepped off the stage, leaving a presumably gobsmacked Curro halfway through her interview in front of 450 people.\n Earlier, Geldof had the stage to himself, which he'd used to wax on about global politics from French President Emmanuel Macron to US President Donald Trump. He also had some observations about property, including that he'd been a squatter before buying his first home outright. We're not sure how relatable that was to the real estate types who'd turned out to hear him, but maybe they got off lightly. According to a March report in the London Mirror , Geldof was encouraged off the stage of a financial services conference by British journalist Gabby Logan after telling guests that the public hated them. The conference organisers said that they'd just run out of time … and not a moment too soon!",

Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The NSW Land & Environment Court has knocked back RDA Property Group's appeal to build seven more units at its Bronte Place mixed-use apartment project at the controversial former Bronte RSL site in Sydney's eastern suburbs.\nSubjected to years of public protests, RDA , led by former fashion identity Danny Avidan , was the last in a line of developers to take on the project at at 109-113 Macpherson Street , approved for 21 apartments last year.\nRDA lodged a revised development application in December, in accordance with the Local Environment Plan, but was refused by Waverley Council.\nAfter facing court with an appeal three weeks ago, Commissioner Dickson on Tuesday dismissed the appeal due to the solar impact the additional units could cause to existing approved units.\nAny revisions to height and other development potential should be made through a planning proposal rather than a revision to the council approval, the commissioner said.\n Mr Avidan said he accepted the decision and would push on with the project, which has already been delayed.\n\"I respectfully accept the court's decision despite the fact that I disagree with the findings. I will proceed with the current approvals,\" he said.\nThe project is on a 2231 sq m site with ground-floor retail space, and is close to Bronte Beach.\nThe community, led by the Save Bronte group, protested the developer's decision to vary the 21-unit low-rise approval.",

She didn't know you were supposed to feel refreshed when you wake up in the morning.\nAfter being diagnosed with sleep apnoea and being told by her partner that she was snoring at night, she began exploring alternatives to a CPAP machine (a mask with an air pump attached) or dental appliance that she would have to wear at night. \nSHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Fiona Teudt is breathing easy and wakes feeling more refreshed after doing a Buteyko course.  A friend had done a Buteyko course, where practitioners are trained to breathe slowly and evenly through the nose. The method, advocates say, can lead to \"significant improvements\" among those with asthma, sleep disordered breathing and other respiratory conditions.\nTeudt chose to try the course herself and, the night after her first two-hour session that involved various breathing exercises, discovered how rest was meant to feel.\nAdvertisement \"For the first time in my life I felt like I had a proper night's sleep and actually felt refreshed. I didn't know we were meant to experience that so it has quite genuinely changed my life,\" the 55-year-old from Manly Vale said. \"Now I'm quite happy with seven to eight hours. It's given me more hours in my day that I didn't have before.\"\nAs for her snoring and sleep apnoea, she says she hasn't done another sleep study because she hasn't felt the need. \nSHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Mim Beim, a Buteyko teacher, believes there are plenty of benefits to breathing through the nose.   \"My partner tells me I do still snore some of the time – now, I snore through my nose instead of my mouth,\" she says chuckling, \"but because I now feel so well, I don't mind that I snore some of the time.\"\nThe power of the breath \nDr Angelina Fong is a lecturer in the department of physiology at the University of Melbourne.\nShe says she doesn't know a lot about the Buteyko technique, which was developed in the 1950s by Ukrainian doctor Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko. But, she does know that the breath is an underused tool in our mental and physical health.\n\"Breath is one of those things that we just do and most people don't ever think about – a lot of people underestimate the power of breathing and breathing properly,\" Fong says. \"I say to a lot of people we don't know how to breathe properly.\"\nThis is because, Fong says, unless you're a singer or an athlete, a yogi or a freediver, learning breath regulation and deep, slow breath is not something most of us are ever trained to do.\n\"There's a lot of anecdotal evidence that it does have impacts on body systems, on health and physiology – for example, in pranayama [the yogic practice of breath control] there are techniques for lowering blood pressure, techniques you shouldn't do if you have high blood pressure and so on,\" Fong explains, adding that scientific research has also been conducted. \n\"There is some evidence that slow, deep breathing can help lower heart rate and lower blood pressure because these two systems are really tightly integrated together. You also hear the stories of athletes who control their breath to control their heart rate and so on. We know there is a lot of power behind how we breathe and controlling breathing can have impacts on other systems, getting deeper breaths, getting more oxygen in, getting more CO₂ out, is going to help balance and help maintain physiology better. There's no doubt about that.\" \nThere is little doubt about the psychological benefits of breath work too.\n\"You can think about it from a mindfulness perspective – what goes on during meditation,\" Fong says. \"Maybe being aware of the breath changes the neurochemistry – the functions in the brain that calm you.\"\nShe notes one study that looked at anxiety indexes over six months and, among those who practiced a slow, mindful breath, there was a reduction of anxiety levels (it is also Hillary Clinton's preferred method for anxiety-reduction).\n\"It's certainly a possibility that being aware of the breath then changes how your mind is, which brings a calming effect, which could potentially override some of the impacts of stress and anxiety, which we know have all these downstream effects of cardiovascular function, metabolic function and so-on.\"\nWhy nasal breathing? \nApart from practicing awareness of the breath and slowing it down, a common theme in the various techniques is nasal breathing.\nFong says that anatomically, the nose is designed to help warm and humidify and cleanse the air as we breathe in, but apart from that says it's unclear why nasal breath tends to be emphasised in eastern breathing techniques.\nMim Beim, a naturopath and Buteyko teacher says that the curvature of the nose means we are forced to breathe more gently and slowly than through the mouth. \n\"If you've coached yourself into more gentle breathing the upper airway remains open,\" she adds, explaining why it may assist those with snoring issues. \nBeim, who credits the technique for helping cure her of asthma 20 years ago, believes there are other benefits to breathing through the nose. \n\"The nasal cavity takes up a third of the skull and the mucus membrane produce the most nitric oxide in the body – nitric oxide being an amazing antioxidant and also an antibiotic,\" says Beim, who is running a training program in early November alongside the \"world's leading authority\" on the Buteyko Method, Patrick McKeown. \"If you're not nose breathing you're missing out on a lot of nitric oxide.\"\nA slow and steady race to better health \nThe technique, she says involves reducing the rate or volume of breathing, but it is not about shallow breathing. \n\"It is normalising breathing to being diaphragmatic, to being at a slower rate,\" Beim explains, adding it has the \"same physiological basis\" as other pranayama techniques.\n\"The idea is that people have gotten into a habit of over-breathing where the carbon dioxide levels are a little bit lower than optimal – and we're talking a tiny per cent, it's not changing pH that much, but shifting that a little bit.\n\"The idea is that Buteyko is like a bootcamp and changing the brain's acceptance of having that slightly higher CO₂ so that affects the relaxing of smooth muscle , of switching on the parasympathetic nervous system, of increasing oxygenation become normal.\"\nRelaxing the smooth muscle of the blood vessels helps with high blood pressure and headaches, Beim says while relaxing the smooth muscle of the bowel can help with reflux and IBS symptoms while the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract affects asthma, sinusitis and hayfever.\nFong is \"uncomfortable with the extent of the claims\" without more evidence, but says \"I don't see any major harm in breathing techniques compared to pharmaceuticals and so on which have broader implications\". \nFor Beim and Teudt, the effects have been \"extraordinary\".\n\"It's totally changed the way I practice,\" says Beim, who has been a naturopath for 30 years. \n\"I find that the breathing is the most fundamental thing and if people are not breathing well then changing that has incredible flow on ... Diet is really important, exercise is really important but why don't we think about the breath?\" \n0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Fedpol. Photo: Andrew Meares  Photo: Andrew Meares And two weeks after those hearings, the court will rule on Friday at 2.15pm on Mr Joyce's fate, and that of six senators: Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash, former Nationals cabinet minister Matt Canavan, former Greens senators Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam, One Nation's Malcolm Roberts and NXT leader Nick Xenophon.\nIf a byelection is ordered in Mr Joyce's northern NSW seat of New England, the earliest the poll can be held is December 2.\nAs the only lower house MP, and with the Turnbull government holding just 76 seats in the 150-member lower house, it is Mr Joyce's case the government is most concerned about, although independent MP Cathy McGowan said on Tuesday that she would continue to support the government, which gives the Coalition some breathing room.\nFairfax Media spoke to half a dozen Nationals MPs on Tuesday and the prevailing view was that Mr Joyce, who referred himself to the Court in August when he learnt he was a New Zealander by descent through his father James, is that a byelection is increasingly likely.\nAdvertisement \"That fact that it has taken so long for the court to make its ruling doesn't bode well,\" one MP, who asked not to be named, said, \"and all sorts of theories are sweeping the place.\"\n\"Let's get through to Friday and see what happens,\" said another MP. \"The fact it has taken two weeks is a worry. Confidence has been eaten away as the days have gone by.\"\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly said that, based on the advice of the Solicitor-General, \"We are very, very confident that our members who have been caught up in this will be held by the court to be eligible to sit in the Parliament and therefore eligible to be ministers.\"\nB ut another Nationals source said that the two-week delay in the ruling could favour Mr Joyce as a \"black letter law\" decision against the Nationals leader would likely have been made quickly.\nWhile confidence is falling in government ranks that the court will rule favourably for Mr Joyce, to a person Nationals MPs believe Mr Joyce would win a byelection that could feature a Melbourne Cup field of candidates from Labor, One Nation, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, and possibly former New England independent and political foe Tony Windsor.\nIf Mr Joyce loses his seat, Nationals Senate leader Nigel Scullion is the next in line to take over by dint of seniority, even though he is in the upper house and the Coalition will likely face at least one sitting week without Mr Joyce as lower house leader.\nInfrastructure Minister Darren Chester and Small Business Minister Michael McCormack are both seen as future leaders of the Nationals and are in the lower house.\nABC psephologist Antony Green told Fairfax Media that December 2 was the most likely date should a byelection be ordered, but December 9 was possible if a Queensland state election was called for November 25.",

What if that doctor is also being bullied or sexually harassed at work or being pressured to work excessive hours? What if they haven't slept for days?\nThese are just some the questions raised in a new verbatim theatre production, Grace Under Pressure , which examines the working lives of health professionals and asks: \"Who is caring for those in the caring professions?\"\nSHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Renee Lim: Under pressure to balance being a human being with being a doctor.  Photo: Louie Douvis Performed by four actors playing 18 characters, the script is based on hours of interviews with 30 doctors and nurses who spoke in-depth about their experiences of training and working in hospitals.\n\"There are lots of stories of exhaustion and working extremely long hours,\" says writer-director David Williams, who created the show with the University of Sydney's Paul Dwyer in collaboration with the Sydney Arts and Health Collective.\n\"People can be so tired that they have car accidents on the way home from night shifts. People can be on call overnight after they've worked all day. They get called in and they don't sleep but are expected to come back the next day.\"\nFor actor Renee Lim, the stories are close to home – she is also a doctor working in palliative care and accident and emergency.\nAdvertisement \"For me and my friends, one of the biggest pressures is how to balance being a human being with being a doctor,\" she says. \"How do you get through a day and eat enough and drink enough and go to the toilet at least twice, which is what normal people do, then also see the 37 patients they need to check on and make sure they don't die.\"\nAdd to all that the pressure of \"wanting to be perfect\", Lim says. \"So many doctors entering the profession want to be perfect, to save people and change the world. Then they find the system disempowers them.\"\nYou will now receive updates from Entertainment Newsletter Entertainment Newsletter Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nSome of the doctors and nurses Williams interviewed had dropped out of the hospital system to work in general practice or private care facilities. \"They found the pressure of the hospital system untenable but they loved the care element of it,\" Williams says.\n\"There are people who struggle with depression. Some get help and that help works. Some seek help and that help doesn't work or isn't offered. There have been lots of stories about health professionals or clinical staff who have felt unsupported to the extent that they have taken extreme measures: going public with sexual harassment or in some cases taking their own life.\"\nReports from Beyond Blue have suggested rates of clinical depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour among doctors and nurses are twice as high as in the general population.\nLim hopes audiences coming to see Grace Under Pressure will be reminded of their humanity. \"I hope people walk away going, 'wow, doctors are human beings too'. They can be broken, they can be wrong, they care and they are trying their best. We are all in this together. How you deal with a human being the next day, is something you can choose.\"\nGrace Under Pressure plays at the Seymour Centre from October 25-28. It is part of The Big Anxiety- Festival of Arts + Science + People.",

It was ex-Brisbane, Collingwood and Carlton ruckman Cameron Wood, of course.\nThe journeyman — who retired at the end of the 2016 season — made an appearance on the quiz show on Monday afternoon and, contrary to what some would expect from a footy player, was successful.\nWinners are grinners 😀💰 let me know when you want to go to the footy too @anne_hegerty 🏉🌭 #TheChaseAus #TheGoverness #thankgodforpeter #YTB https://t.co/l0X0RmoWRE\n— Cameron Wood (@probably_wood) October 23, 2017 Congratulations to our winning team! 👏 #TheChaseAus pic.twitter.com/sxcCudwEqL\n— The Chase Australia (@THECHASEAUS) October 23, 2017 After pointing out that he was still playing local footy for Avondale Heights, Wood took on quizmaster Andrew O’Keefe and performed solidly, earning $10,000 for his team.\nHe then flirted with ‘The Governess’ — suggesting he could take her to an AFL match — before successfully making his way through into the final round.\n“A little bit of guessing going on there,” The Governess suggested.\nmedia_camera Cameron Wood celebrates a goal while playing for Carlton.

SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link British Airways has apologised after at least three passengers reported walking off an overnight flight from Vancouver covered in red welts. Photo: AP \nSo she rang the bell and informed a flight attendant - quietly, lest she alarm her 7-year-old daughter or the passenger into whose seat back the thing had disappeared - that British Airways Flight 84 might have a bedbug problem. \n\"The flight attendant said, 'We don't have anywhere to move you. I'm really sorry',\" Szilagyi said. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Passenger Heather Szilagyi used to clean hotel rooms, she said, so knows a bedbug when she sees one. Photo: Piotr Naskrecik \nNow British Airways says it's sorry, too. The airline apologised in a statement to CTV News after Szilagyi, her daughter and at least one other passenger reported walking off the nine-hour flight from Vancouver covered in red welts. \nSzilagyi used to clean hotel rooms, she said, and so knows a bedbug when she sees one. She and daughter Molly are allergic to them, but Szilagyi tried to stay optimistic on the October 10 flight. Advertisement \nAs the cabin lights dimmed and Molly drifted off to sleep, Szilagyi tried to convince herself that the bedbug that crawled out of her TV was a random stray - perhaps left there by some unfortunate passenger before her.

By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nLikewise, when she looked down from her dinner tray a bit later, she said, she hoped it was just a flax seed that lay in her lap. \nBut seeds don't move. \n\"This one I grabbed and squished in Kleenex,\" Szilagyi said. Then she rang the bell again. \nThe flight attendant thanked her and took the insect away as if it were just a discarded coffee cup, she recalled. Then Szilagyi spotted two more bugs and debated in whispers with her fiance whether to risk a panic by alerting the other passengers. \n\"I knew it was a real infestation,\" she said. \"But we didn't want to ruin someone else's trip, and there's nothing they could do anyway.\" \nSo Szilagyi drank two glasses of wine, closed her eyes and tried her best to accept the inevitable. \nCome daylight and the end of the flight, she said, she saw bites on Molly thighs. The family had travelled to Europe for a funeral but spent their first night on the continent throwing pillows in a hotel dishwasher and soaking their clothes in scalding water. \n\"The next morning, me and Molly were just covered in bites,\" Szilagyi said. \nOver the next week, she said, her daughter's welts became infected and bled. Szilagyi said she and her fiance spent much of the trip on hold with British Airways, in a fruitless effort to ensure they didn't share the flight home with yet more bedbugs. \nThe couple finally started posting proof of their suffering on Twitter, which resulted in British tabloid headlines such as: \"JUST PLANE AWFUL: Furious mum slams British Airways after daughter, 7, was ravaged by BED BUGS and left bleeding on flight.\" \n\"How embarrassing is that, to be known for this?\" Szilagyi said. But her fury had some effect. \nShe said British Airways representatives met her family at the airport as they left London. They got a promise to fumigate better and a free seat upgrade - neither quite guarantees against bedbugs. \n\"It doesn't matter what class you're in, you're still going to get bugs,\" Szilagyi noted. But the flight back to Vancouver turned out insect-free, as far as she knows, and the carrier has since been conciliatory. \n\"We have been in touch with our customer to apologise and investigate further,\" the airline wrote in a statement to CTV News last week. \"British Airways operates more than 280,000 flights every year, and reports of bed bugs onboard are extremely rare.\" \nNot rare enough for some. The airline had at least one bedbug incident last year, which resulted in a plane being pulled from service. \nAnd on Friday, another passenger on Szilagyi's flight told Global News that he left the plane with bites across his back and has since thrown out his clothes. \nThe Washington Post",

Photo: AP So she rang the bell and informed a flight attendant - quietly, lest she alarm her 7-year-old daughter or the passenger into whose seat back the thing had disappeared - that British Airways Flight 84 might have a bedbug problem.\n\"The flight attendant said, 'We don't have anywhere to move you. I'm really sorry',\" Szilagyi said.\nSHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Passenger Heather Szilagyi used to clean hotel rooms, she said, so knows a bedbug when she sees one.   Photo: Piotr Naskrecik Now British Airways says it's sorry, too. The airline apologised in a statement to CTV News after Szilagyi, her daughter and at least one other passenger reported walking off the nine-hour flight from Vancouver covered in red welts.\nSzilagyi used to clean hotel rooms, she said, and so knows a bedbug when she sees one. She and daughter Molly are allergic to them, but Szilagyi tried to stay optimistic on the October 10 flight.\nAdvertisement As the cabin lights dimmed and Molly drifted off to sleep, Szilagyi tried to convince herself that the bedbug that crawled out of her TV was a random stray - perhaps left there by some unfortunate passenger before her.\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nLikewise, when she looked down from her dinner tray a bit later, she said, she hoped it was just a flax seed that lay in her lap.\nBut seeds don't move.\n\"This one I grabbed and squished in Kleenex,\" Szilagyi said. Then she rang the bell again.\nThe flight attendant thanked her and took the insect away as if it were just a discarded coffee cup, she recalled. Then Szilagyi spotted two more bugs and debated in whispers with her fiance whether to risk a panic by alerting the other passengers.\n\"I knew it was a real infestation,\" she said. \"But we didn't want to ruin someone else's trip, and there's nothing they could do anyway.\"\nSo Szilagyi drank two glasses of wine, closed her eyes and tried her best to accept the inevitable.\nCome daylight and the end of the flight, she said, she saw bites on Molly thighs. The family had travelled to Europe for a funeral but spent their first night on the continent throwing pillows in a hotel dishwasher and soaking their clothes in scalding water.\n\"The next morning, me and Molly were just covered in bites,\" Szilagyi said.\nOver the next week, she said, her daughter's welts became infected and bled. Szilagyi said she and her fiance spent much of the trip on hold with British Airways, in a fruitless effort to ensure they didn't share the flight home with yet more bedbugs.\nThe couple finally started posting proof of their suffering on Twitter, which resulted in British tabloid headlines such as: \"JUST PLANE AWFUL: Furious mum slams British Airways after daughter, 7, was ravaged by BED BUGS and left bleeding on flight.\"\n\"How embarrassing is that, to be known for this?\" Szilagyi said. But her fury had some effect.\nShe said British Airways representatives met her family at the airport as they left London. They got a promise to fumigate better and a free seat upgrade - neither quite guarantees against bedbugs.\n\"It doesn't matter what class you're in, you're still going to get bugs,\" Szilagyi noted. But the flight back to Vancouver turned out insect-free, as far as she knows, and the carrier has since been conciliatory.\n\"We have been in touch with our customer to apologise and investigate further,\" the airline wrote in a statement to CTV News last week. \"British Airways operates more than 280,000 flights every year, and reports of bed bugs onboard are extremely rare.\"\nNot rare enough for some. The airline had at least one bedbug incident last year, which resulted in a plane being pulled from service.\nAnd on Friday, another passenger on Szilagyi's flight told Global News that he left the plane with bites across his back and has since thrown out his clothes.\nThe Washington Post",

Photo: JUDE KEOGH 1024jkfield2 \nIt’s more than tractors and tools at the Australian National Field Days – there’s almost everything for country residents and farmers. \nJohn Lulham, along with his wife Wendy and son Dave, run the Nick Nack Gallery and they’ve brought around 5000 hats made by Statesman, Barmah, Rigon and Jackeru. \nHis stock includes hats made from fur-felt or kangaroo leather and some approved by the Cancer Council. \nAfter 20 years of selling hats at the field days, Mr Lulham says a good hat is “one that fits”. \nMr Lulham said he travelled eastern Australia going from field days to the biggest regional agricultural shows. \nHe said some customers came back year after year, looking for a new hat which fit their children, “and often a new hat for themselves”. \nMr Lulham said Barmah’s kangaroo leather hats were the “Rolls-Royce” of the style – which were even rain shower-proof. \nMeanwhile, Statesmen hats started in 1835 in Brisbane, but the brand name was practically unknown despite supplying boarding schools and the Australian Defence Force. \nMr Lulham said while city dwellers had stopped wearing hats they remained an “essential accessory for country people”. \n“If you look at the movies and my grandfather, they all had fur-felt hats,” he said. \nThe Nick Nack Gallery will be located at site E4 during the Australian National Field Days from Thursday.",

      "text": "twitter TWEET The 144 th Westbury Show is just around the corner, and is set for another bumper year. \nAmong the attractions on Saturday, November 11, will be a cattle display, model plane demonstrations, yard dogs, a pet parade competition, a horse show and a sidesaddle horse riding demonstration. \nThere will also be a kids corner, featuring horse riding, an animal nursery, face painting and activities run by the Police Citizens Youth Club. \nOne of the biggest drawcards will be the presence of chainsaw sculptor Eddie Freeman. \nShow president Kevin Lattin said the event was a great opportunity for people in the community to come together. \n“The show injects a bit of life into the town,” Mr Lattin said. \n“It’s a good social point for the farming community, and a big part of the day is the social aspect. \n“Getting around and seeing people you don’t see all that often.” \nIn addition, Mr Lattin also said it was an opportunity for the town to demonstrate what it has to offer to visitors. \n“Looking around the crowd, there’s generally a lot of people I don’t recognise,” he said. \n“I’d say that people come out from Launceston, and they might come back other weekends to check out Steamworld and a few other different things. \n“People even came from Circular Head a few years ago to see how they could improve their show.” \nThe annual event is one of Tasmania’s oldest shows, and has some major differences from Tasmania’s larger shows. \nThe Showmen’s Guild of Tasmania does not have a presence at the show, meaning no sideshow alley events and no amusement rides. \nThe Westbury Show also makes a profit. \n“I’ve been involved with the show for five or six years now, and we seem to get a reasonably good crowd – it’s making a profit every year,” Mr Lattin said. \n“Launceston Show organisers told me, ‘shows don’t make a profit’, well ours certainly does.” \nThe Westbury Show will be held on November 11 from 8am until 4pm at the Westbury Showground. \nTickets cost $10 for adults and $5 for children.",

Hobart also boasts the largest average lots, at 669 square metres and land costs just $196 a square metre - an increase of 28 per cent since 2007.\nSydney, despite being the most expensive land market in Australia, also offers the second largest average lot sizes at 470 square metres, trailed by Brisbane at 448 square metres.\nLand in Brisbane costs $563 a square metre, trailing slightly behind Adelaide which recorded land values of $602 a square metre.",

External Link: Tweet by Hillcrest Schools: Many things and people make us love Australia. For Hillcrest Preparatory School it is our Head Teacher Ms. Gabrielle Happy #AustraliaDay \nHe said there is evidence to show the men were not at the scene or involved in the shooting. \nMs Maina was shot dead while walking home last Thursday. The killing shocked the small community of Karen, where she lived. \nA post mortem was conducted on Ms Maina's body on Monday. \nIt found she died from a single gunshot wound to the neck. The bullet travelled down her body and exited through her back. \nThe autopsy was carried out by Kenya's Chief Pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor. \nMs Maina moved to Kenya in 2015, and was the head teacher at Hillcrest Preparatory School in Karen. She had previously worked as a teacher in New South Wales and attended university at the University of New England in Armidale. \nMs Maina was an active member of the tight-knit community in the Nairobi suburb of Karen. Last Saturday, members of the local Karen Vineyard Church said prayers and expressed shock and sorry over her death. \nInvestigations are continuing.",

      "text": "Autonomous freight platooning plans in NSW   \nThe New South Wales Government is exploring the possibilities of autonomous trucks with freight movements expected to double across metropolitan areas and by up to 25 per cent in the bush by 2056, according to a report from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). \nTransport Minister, Andrew Constance, has reportedly unveiled a regional transport plan at Ballina that would suggest that driverless freight trucks could be a common sight on New South Wales roads in the future. \n\"Certainly in terms of safety, first and foremost, it will be a big change,\" said Constance. \"And we are working to make sure that with the advent of autonomous vehicles, particularly in the bush, we do actually look at what's required in an infrastructure sense.\" \nRoads Minister, Melinda Pavey , reportedly told the ABC that she would prefer autonomous vehicle trials to be conducted in regional New South Wales. \n\"That is the area that is probably weaker in our road safety statistics and we want to see that improved,\" said Pavey. \"And it is vital that regional communities are part of it and we are not scared about how it's going to change things because it's going to make the roads safer.\" \nShe reportedly said the state introduced legislation in the past few months so it could be ready for this change. \n\"Our officials are watching what's happening throughout the world,” said Pavey. \n“We want to be part of it, we don't want to make it complicated if anybody wants to come in and bring autonomous vehicle technology that's going to make it safer on our roads. \n\"It's contrary to our own instincts to think it would be safe without a driver behind the wheel but we must remember that 94 per cent of all accidents involve human error and if we can harness the latest technology, we can actually save lives and drive the road toll down,” she said. \nThe ABC has said that the concept contained in the draft regional transport plan will be open for community comment until 3 December. \nIn July, Viva Energy said that autonomous and platooning truck technology will become prevalent on Australian roads in less than 20 years while Kings Transport CEO, Tony Mellick, questioned whether the country's infrastructure would be ready.

Though instability continues to plague Pakistan and many areas are dominated by social conservatism, some of the country's more affluent residents have worked to fashion a very different kind of lifestyle for themselves.

REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra (PAKISTAN - Tags: SOCIETY HEALTH) ATTENTION EDITORS - PICTURE 17 OF 25 FOR PACKAGE 'THE OTHER PAKISTAN' TO FIND ALL IMAGES SEARCH 'ZOHRA UPPER' Reuters \nSydney sees jobs boon for beauty therapists and fitness instructors, according to the latest round of census figures with a focus on how and where Australians work. The census data, released on Monday, show that the number of people working as beauty therapists and fitness instructors in Australia has surged by more than 25 percent since 2011. The jobs growth is driven by its two biggest cities, Melbourne and Sydney. \nSome workers are in healthcare and social assistance as nurses, counsellors and care workers for older Aussies. In New South Wales, healthcare and social assistance sector was the largest employer. \nRecent employment figures also show Melbourne's love for food, bars and coffee. They are the city's next-largest employer, with 2.5 percent of all workers. \nAnd there is also a push towards the service economy, with the number of workers in the community and personal service sector now up 19 percent since last figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Meanwhile, the share of technicians and trades workers in Sydney has edged lower over the past decade to 11.7 percent. \nNew figures also suggest that age affects the types of jobs Australians are performing. Some people under 30 take on roles as food cooks, baristas, waiters, bartenders or sportspeople. Meanwhile, those who are aged 60 were likely to be caretakers, bus drivers and livestock and crop farmers. \nBetween the genders, the gap is widest in technical and trade. These industries have 84 percent male employees. Females take on more positions in some of the fastest growing areas like social assistance and education, with 74 percent of health professionals and 63 percent of legal, social and welfare professionals. \n\"Alongside this, we are seeing the proportion of men in employment decrease over time, while for women it is increasing,\" census program manager Bindi Kindermann said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald . Nationally, nearly 80 percent of the 1.35 million people hired in the healthcare and social assistance sector are females. \nThe census data showed females now make up 55.4 percent of professionals nationally. The figures can be comparable to 53.9 percent in 2011. \n\"The predominance of females in these occupations reflects the greater numbers of females among university graduates over recent decades,\" Parr said. The lift in share of female managers from 35.4 percent in 2011 to 37 percent in 2016 is linked to the retirement of more male-dominated Baby Boomer generation managers.",

      "text": "Tweet \nMitchell Pearce could learn a thing or two from State of Origin rival Cooper Cronk if the Sydney Roosters sign him, according to Queensland coach Kevin Walters. \nThe Roosters remain front-runners ahead of Parramatta and Cronulla for Cronk's signature after the Queensland and Australian halfback told his manager last Friday he wanted to play on in Sydney. \nSuch a signing could create havoc for the Roosters' roster though, given Pearce has been their first-choice No.7 since 2007 and is signed until the end of 2019. \nThey could shift him to five-eighth or hooker but incumbents Luke Keary and captain Jake Friend are also contracted by the club into next season. \nThe rumours have fuelled speculation Pearce could be on the outer at Bondi, with two rival clubs having already reportedly expressed interest in the 28-year-old. \nBut Walters said if Cronk was to be lured to the Tri-colours, NSW Origin halfback Pearce should see it as an opportunity to stick around and learn. \n\"If I'm a Mitchell Pearce or a Luke Keary at that club, I'd probably want them in the club because you're going to get better with them there,\" Walters told Sky Sports Radio. \n\"Maybe a little time with Cooper Cronk might help (Pearce's) game and take it to another level, which is a bit scary from a Queensland point of view.\" \nPearce will also likely face mounting pressure in 2018 to keep his NSW Origin spot. \nThis year's series loss marked his seventh in as many attempts for the Blues, while the yet-to-be appointed NSW coach will likely have to make a call on whether Penrith teenager Nathan Cleary is ready to step into the arena. \nWalters insisted his comments weren't a shot at Pearce. \n\"We always see Mitchell and the talent he has,\" he said. \n\"I reckon (Pearce and Keary) would be pretty excited. If Cronk was to go to one of those clubs, he would certainly bring so much on the field but certainly off the field with how he goes about things. \n\"I've seen it at Origin level. Some of these players we bring in who come into camp, they learn more from Cronk and Slater and Smith, Thurston and Matt Scott and Inglis than they do the coaching staff.\" Advertisement",

      "text": "Warriors win JLT Cup final in style 22nd Oct 2017 8:26 AM Western Australia celebrate with the trophy after the JLT One Day Cup Final match between Western Australia and South Australia at Blundstone Arena. Ryan Pierse Use this content by RICHARD EARLE, The Advertiser \nMITCHELL Marsh's savvy captaincy and smart hitting saw Western Australia win the JLT Cup final in a canter against South Australia as Justin Langer's golden era continued in Hobart. \nThe Warriors (4/250) hardly raised a sweat in a six-wicket win where undefeated skipper Marsh dominated a 249-run chase with a run-a-ball 80. \nMan-of-the-match Marsh crashed his ninth and winning boundary past long-off in the 44th over from Kane Richardson (1/47). It was an emphatic innings that must have warmed the hearts of national selectors. \n\"I am so happy for the boys and coaching staff. As a captain you take credit but you lean on all the senior boys,\" said Marsh. \nWarriors coach Langer has transformed Western Australia's culture and fortunes since appointed in 2012. Test legend Langer has delivered two one-day titles, two Sheffield Shield final appearances and three Twenty20 titles for Perth Scorchers. \nSA skipper Travis Head conceded his side was outplayed but deserved credit for making a fourth domestic final inside three seasons. \n\"Not enough runs unfortunately, I thought we did a good job with the ball. Western Australia was too good,\" Head told ABC Radio. \n\"If you look back three seasons ago were bottom and pretty much a laughing stock. We have given ourselves the chance to win silverware and it is not far off. This team keeps better and better, it's exciting and not far away.\" \nThe Redbacks won't have time to lament lost silverware hosting a Sheffield Shield season opener against Steve Smith's Test strength New South Wales Sheffield Shield starting Friday. \nMitchell Marsh couldn't bowl due to a sore shoulder but figured in a decisive 126-run, third-wicket stand with Cameron Bancroft (76). \nA short pitched barrage from Richardson eventually unseated Bancroft while Adam Zampa (1/59) bowled Ashton Turner (35) in the 39th over but the damage was done. \nFormer Australian batsman Shaun Marsh (32) set the tone for his younger brother despite the early departure of Michael Klinger (1). \nThe contest was effectively over at the half way mark of WA's innings, adding to the gloom of an empty Bellerive hosting a neutral final on a cold Saturday night. \nSurely, Cricket Australia must end the snub, particularly to SA fans, who haven't seen their one-day side in the flesh for four years. \nThe Redbacks sabotaged their innings, failing to capitalise on a series of starts and promising partnerships against a quality attack. All Marsh's bowling changes came off with precision. \nIn-form opening pair Jake Weatherald (4) and Alex Carey (16) fell inside five overs to returning Australian new-ball pair Nathan Coulter-Nile (2/54) and Jason Behrendorff (2/49). \nCallum Ferguson was in rare touch with 37 off 34 balls before slashing Coulter-Nile. Marsh reintroduced Jhye Richardson (2/47) with immediate effect, bowling a set Head for 37 off 40. \nTom Cooper (63) intervened in a 45-run, sixth-wicket stand with Cam Valente (38). However the Redbacks hopes of a competitive total were dashed when Cooper was claimed by Darcy Short's leg-spin. Related Items",

      "text": "Mitchell Moses at Lebanon training on Tuesday. Photo: Supplied \nThe 23-year-old's stocks are on the rise after a strong finish to the season culminated in the Eels playing finals football for the first time since 2009. He will be able to show how much his game has matured in clashes with France, England and Australia in what could prove to be an invaluable opportunity to bond with Fittler. \nWith long-time NSW halfback Mitchell Pearce again under pressure to retain the NSW No.7 jersey after another failed campaign, Moses said he was keen to crack the Origin arena. \n\"Definitely, 100 per cent. It's my goal every year,\" Moses said. \n\"If I keep playing the footy I was playing towards the end of the year, that stuff will sort itself out. We'll see what happens.\" Advertisement \nMoses said the opportunity to impress the likely NSW coach wasn't lost on him. \n\"Exactly. Whatever [selectors] do, I grew up idolising Freddie, he was one of the best five-eighths in the game.

I'll take a lot out of this; whatever he has to say, I'll be listening. \n\"I'm not looking at it as in he's going to get the Blues job, I'll look at it as him being a world-class coach and a world-class player when he was playing. Whatever advice he has for me, I'll take in on board.\" \nFittler has already made his mark with the Cedars. The Panthers and Roosters legend has asked his squad to learn the Lebanese national anthem, orders his players to do 50 push-ups a day and encourages them to finish training by taking their boots off in an attempt to get back to nature. \nMoses is buying in. \n\"It's a bit different, he's a pretty relaxed bloke,\" he said. \n\"For myself, I looked up to Freddie when I was younger and I'll take as much as I can out of this camp. \n\"He's one of the best five-eighths to play the game so whatever he says and whenever he gives you a few pointers about the game, you're always going to listen.\" \nThe opportunity to come into Lebanon camp with a mix of NRL players and semi-professionals is just the tonic to help Moses overcome the heartbreak of Parramatta's finals exit. \n\"It's brought my spirits back up,\" he said. \"It was pretty shattering the way we finished and being here has helped me get over it. \n\"I've learned a lot [playing finals football]. The speed of the game, how much it changed, it's going to be the best thing for us as a team at Parramatta. We'll look to have a big year and take that experience into next season. \n\"I feel I've got a fair bit of improvement to go from this pre-season. Once this tournament is over I'll get straight back into training and get that full pre-eason under my belt. It will be massive.\"",

      "text": "Coffs Harbour bypass is in the slow lane 24th Oct 2017 10:00 AM | Updated: 1:00 PM Login to follow Coffs Harbour Bypass update: Senate Estimates discusses the Coffs Harbour Pacific Highway Bypass. \nUPDATE: ANTHONY Albanese is being 'fast and loose with the truth' according to Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister Luke Hartsuyker as the Federal Government progresses plans for the Pacific Highway bypass of Coffs Harbour. \nAfter the $1 billion project was again raised in the Senate Estimates Committee yesterday and seized on by Labor today, Mr Hartsuyker said planning on the NSW Government's business case had been underway for some time. \n\"I have been in discussions with the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the Transport Minister Darren Chester on the issue of the bypass and I held significant discussions with the Prime Minister last when he was in Coffs Harbour and inspecting the Kundabung section of the Pacific Highway,\" Mr Hartsuyker said. \n\"Planning on the NSW Government's business case is underway and has been underway for some time. \n\"Detailed planning is happening across a range of areas including geo-technical studies, traffic and planning studies and significant property acquisitions have been completed. \n\"Extensive community consultation has also been held and there were public notices in The Advocate on August 24, 27 and 31st seeking the views of the community for the proposals of the bypass. \n\"I'm lobbying to get the project started as quickly as possible and the government's focus is on duplicating a number of sections of the highway. \n\"Saving lives has been the priority, there have been 95% reduction rates in fatalities and accidents ... so fixing those sections has been the first priority. \n\"Coffs Harbour is the most expensive project. It makes commercial sense for the government to complete it to maximise its return on the investment across the Pacific Highway.\" \n\"Labor is whinging not enough is happening on the Pacific Highway, but North Coast residents can see the pace of the work north of Woolgoolga in the Page and Cowper electorates.\" \nInfrastructure and Transport Minister Darren Chester also issued a statement on the claims from Labor today. \n\"Luke Hartsuyker regularly informs me of the community interest in the Coffs Harbour Bypass and I look forward to receiving the completed business case from the NSW Government,\" Mr Chester said. \nDiscussions on the Coffs Harbour Bypass came as the NSW Government today opened the new section of highway to traffic between Corindi Beach and Halfway Creek. \n\n\nEARLIER: THERE have been no formal discussions concerning funding for the Coffs Harbour Pacific Highway bypass between the Federal and State Coalition Governments, it has been claimed by the Opposition today. \nLabor's spokesman for Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development Anthony Albanese said Senate Budget Estimates Committee hearings in Canberra late yesterday heard that there was no chance that the project would commence any time before 2020, if at all. \n\"In further proof that the Federal MP for Cowper, Luke Hartsuyker, has no clout within the Turnbull Government, the committee heard no detailing planning had been undertaken and that the New South Wales Government was only now beginning to turn its mind to the preparation of a business case for Commonwealth consideration,\" Mr Albanese told The Advocate this morning. \nOfficials from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development said when the NSW Government produced a business case, the Government \"might consider\"' a funding contribution. \nBut nothing would happen until the completion of the ongoing duplication of the Pacific Highway to the Queensland border, which is scheduled for 2020. \nThe committee also heard the department had no idea how much the bypass would cost.

      "text": "Veteran spinner Brad Hogg has pushed for Melbourne Renegades teammate Matthew Wade to be dropped from the Australian Test team, urging the national selectors to back in the younger Alex Carey, provided the South Australian wicketkeeper performs in the early rounds of the Sheffield Shield.\nThe keeper spot in Australia's XI for the first Ashes Test is up for grabs, with incumbent Wade, 29, under pressure to hold his position. Carey, 26, and Peter Nevill, 32, who made way for Wade late last year, are viewed as two the most likely replacements for Wade if the selectors opt to make a change.\nSpeaking on SEN's The Run Home on Tuesday, Hogg – who has signed to play again for the Big Bash League's Renegades, despite approaching his 47th birthday – threw his support behind Carey, and to a lesser extent Nevill, who played with Hogg at the Renegades last summer, but has since moved to the Sydney Sixers.\n\"As far as I'm concerned, if Alex Carey from South Australia does a good job, gets runs on the board early on, I think they should go 'Alex, that's your spot for a number of years' because the keeper's the one that gives you the energy out in the middle,\" Hogg said.\n\"He's the one that can direct traffic, help the captain out, so if you can have a keeper that's stable, there for the long run, keeps the energy up, I think they should be looking at a keeper for the long-term, not the short-term.\n\"I'd love [Peter] Nevill to get back in there, I think he had a great year there last year.\n\"Whoever makes those runs early on should get in there. I think it's between Nevill and Carey at the moment.\n\" 'Wadey', he's had a little bit of a rough patch in the subcontinent. He'd like to have a run in Australian conditions as well.\"\nWade, Nevill and Carey are all set to stake their claims for a berth in the Brisbane Test XI when the Shield season begins later this week.",

Picture: Jason Edwards\n“This is a shameful abuse of process which both the ROC and the Federal Government should be ashamed of themselves.\n“We have always provided any document that the Trade Union Royal commission and the ROC have always requested.\n“Had we been asked in the last 96 hours for these documents we would have done so and instead they have gone for the circus of involving the AFP.\n“This is an abuse of power, it is an abuse of process (and) you have not heard the end of this.”\nmedia_camera Victorian AWU branch secretary Ben Davis says the federal police raids are “an abuse of power”. Picture: Jason Edwards\nAWU national secretary Daniel Walton said the raids were an “extraordinary abuse of police resources and taxpayer funds by a desperate government”.\n“It is clear the ROC has been established not to promote good governance, but to use taxpayer and police resources to muckrake through historic documents in an attempt to find anything that might smear a future Labor PM,” Mr Walton said.\n“This is a shameful new low for a government already scraping the bottom of the political barrel.”\nMr Walton said more than 26 AFP officers were looking for documents dating back to 10 years ago in both Sydney and Melbourne.\nmedia_camera Australian Federal Police officers raid AWU headquarters in Sydney. Picture: James Croucher media_camera Australian Federal Police arrive to raid the Australian Workers Union offices on Sussex St in Sydney. Picture: Hollie Adams/The Australian\n“These documents relate to a number of donations that the union made to GetUp! and made to the Australian Labor Party,” he said.\n“The AWU has and always will cooperate with any investigation.\n“However the investigation which has been commenced today is nothing but an abuse of power.\n“(The documents) do nothing more than highlight the fact that the union made a couple of political donations.”\nLawyers representing the AWU will front the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court to plead their case about the use of AFP powers.\nACTU secretary Sally McManus said the raids were a “shocking attack on democracy”.\n“It just shows how far this government will go to attack working people,” she said.\nmedia_camera Australian Federal Police officers raid AWU headquarters in Sydney. Picture: James Croucher\nLabor workplace relations spokesman Brendan O’Connor said the raids were “an alarming misuse of ministerial power”.\n“Turnbull and his Government openly directed the Commission to start this witch hunt,” he said.\n“The Liberals have already wasted millions of taxpayers’ dollars on their witch hunt into unions.”\n“They will stop at nothing to attack workers and their representatives.”\n“This is the NBN raids during the election campaign all over again. Australians will see this for the desperate tactic that it is.”\nmedia_camera Australian Federal Police arrive to raid the Australian Workers Union offices on Sussex St in Sydney. Picture: Hollie Adams/The Australian media_camera Australian Federal Police officers raid the offices of the AWU on Spencer St. Picture: Aaron Francis/The Australian\nVictorian Trades Hall Council secretary Luke Hilakari said the raids were a “disgrace”.\n“ROC inappropriately using AFP resources. Turnbull is trying to destroy the voices of Aust workers,” he tweeted.\nLabor MP Stephen Jones told the ABC it was “quite clear a request has come down from the Minister’s office to chase this down”.\nA disgrace. Media alerted before union. ROC inappropriately using AFP resources. Turnbull is trying to destroy the voices of Aust workers\n— Luke Hilakari (@lhilakari) October 24, 2017 The investigation is probing the Victorian AWU and national branches over whether donations made to activist GetUp! in 2006 were approved under the union’s rules.\nAt the time Oppositions Leader Bill Shorten was the head of the AWU and the investigation is expected to probe whether these donations were made within the unions rules and regulations.\nMore to come\nOriginally published as Federal police raid AWU offices",

      "text": "Mitchell Moses is hoping his association with Brad Fittler extends beyond their time in Lebanon camp, revealing his desire to impress his long-time hero and likely NSW coach as part of his push for a maiden State of Origin berth next year.\nMoses will partner former Wests Tigers teammate Robbie Farah in the halves for the Cedars in their World Cup opener this weekend. It's a chance for the Parramatta playmaker to forge a strong bond with Lebanon mentor Fittler, tipped to take over from Laurie Daley as Blues coach from next month.\nThe 23-year-old's stocks are on the rise after a strong finish to the season culminated in the Eels playing finals football for the first time since 2009. He will be able to show how much his game has matured in clashes with France, England and Australia in what could prove to be an invaluable opportunity to bond with Fittler.\nWith long-time NSW halfback Mitchell Pearce again under pressure to retain the NSW No.7 jersey after another failed campaign, Moses said he was keen to crack the Origin arena.\n\"Definitely, 100 per cent. It's my goal every year,\" Moses said.\n\"If I keep playing the footy I was playing towards the end of the year, that stuff will sort itself out. We'll see what happens.\"\nAdvertisement Moses said the opportunity to impress the likely NSW coach wasn't lost on him.\n\"Exactly. Whatever [selectors] do, I grew up idolising Freddie, he was one of the best five-eighths in the game.\n\"Whatever advice he can give me, I'm really going to listen in this camp. I'll take a lot out of this; whatever he has to say, I'll be listening.\n\"I'm not looking at it as in he's going to get the Blues job, I'll look at it as him being a world-class coach and a world-class player when he was playing. Whatever advice he has for me, I'll take in on board.\"\nFittler has already made his mark with the Cedars. The Panthers and Roosters legend has asked his squad to learn the Lebanese national anthem, orders his players to do 50 push-ups a day and encourages them to finish training by taking their boots off in an attempt to get back to nature.\nMoses is buying in.\n\"It's a bit different, he's a pretty relaxed bloke,\" he said.\n\"For myself, I looked up to Freddie when I was younger and I'll take as much as I can out of this camp.\n\"He's one of the best five-eighths to play the game so whatever he says and whenever he gives you a few pointers about the game, you're always going to listen.\"\nThe opportunity to come into Lebanon camp with a mix of NRL players and semi-professionals is just the tonic to help Moses overcome the heartbreak of Parramatta's finals exit.\n\"It's brought my spirits back up,\" he said. \"It was pretty shattering the way we finished and being here has helped me get over it.\n\"I've learned a lot [playing finals football]. The speed of the game, how much it changed, it's going to be the best thing for us as a team at Parramatta. We'll look to have a big year and take that experience into next season.\n\"I feel I've got a fair bit of improvement to go from this pre-season. Once this tournament is over I'll get straight back into training and get that full pre-eason under my belt. It will be massive.\"",

      "text": "The Nationals are set to lose the north coast seat of Lismore at the next NSW election, polling suggests, compounding the party's loss of neighbouring Ballina to the Greens in 2015.\nA ReachTel poll shows the Nationals primary vote at 32.8 per cent, Labor on 23.9 per cent and the Greens on 22 per cent. One Nation is on 6.8 per cent, others on 5.6 per cent and nine per cent are undecided.\nThe Nationals primary vote is significantly lower than the 42.4 per cent secured by current MP Thomas George at the 2015 election.\nMr George, who is retiring at the 2019 election narrowly held on in Lismore two years ago against the Greens, leaving the seat one of the most marginal in NSW on just 0.2 per cent.\nOn a two-party preferred basis, the poll has Labor leading the Nationals by 57 per cent to 43 per cent, based on preferences stated by the 753 residents surveyed earlier this month.\nThe Nationals are conducting a community preselection – which involves inviting local non-party members to participate – to choose a candidate for Lismore.\nAdvertisement Labor and the Greens intend to preselect their candidates early next year.\nThe polling was commissioned by the Nature Conservation Council.\nVoters were also asked if the NSW government is doing enough to act on climate change, to which 60.2 per cent responded it was not. Only 28.6 per cent said yes and 11.1 per cent are undecided.\nSixty-seven per cent said they were more likely to vote for a political party that increases solar and wind power and reduces reliance on coal, with 17.8 per cent saying less likely and 15.2 per cent stating it wouldn't change their vote.\nAmong Nationals voters, 40.5 per cent said they would be more likely to vote for a party with those policies, with 33.6 per cent saying less likely and 25.9 per cent saying it would make no difference.\nNature Conservation Council chief executive Kate Smolski said that if the Nationals want to retain Lismore \"they should put forward a candidate who'll put climate change high on the agenda and push the rapid shift to renewables\".\n\"People are crying out for [Premier Gladys] Berejiklian to lead on this issue – including conservative voters – but she still doesn't have a plan,\" she said.\nMs Smolski said the Climate Change Fund Strategic Plan for 2017-2022 was promised for mid-year \"and now is months overdue\".\n\"The government has a commitment to make the state carbon neutral by 2050 but has no plans to replace the state's coal-burners with renewable energy. Without an action plan it's just a pipe dream.\"",

(Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images) by Exclusive: Dean Ritchie \nPARRAMATTA has ended its flirtation with Kangaroos halfback Cooper Cronk. \nEels CEO Bernie Gurr revealed on Tuesday morning his club would not be pursuing off-contract Cronk. \nThe chase for Cronk is now down to two clubs - the Roosters and Sharks. \n\"We're not in the race for Cooper Cronk,\" Gurr said. \n\"We assess every player that comes onto the open market, to see whether they fit our club, fit our salary cap and fit our positional needs. \n\"When we looked at our roster and our positional needs we have opted to go in another direction.\" \nGurr said his club never engaged in \"serious discussions\" with Cronk's management. \nParramatta claim to be more than happy with their existing halves pairing of Corey Norman and Mitch Moses. \nThe Roosters remain favourites to sign Cronk.

      "text": "Sydney NRL clubs lining up to sign Cronk 23rd Oct 2017 8:05 AM OPEN TO OFFERS: Cooper Cronk seems set to join a Sydney club. Bryn Lennon Use this content by Dean Ritchie \nRUGBY LEAGUE: Three clubs have cleared $1 million in salary cap space as the battle for the prized signature of Kangaroos halfback Cooper Cronk hots up. \nThe Sydney Roosters, Cronulla and Parramatta are engaging in an all-out battle for Cronk and have manoeuvred themselves into a position whereby they won't have to shed any players to land him. \nIt is understood Parramatta would use the money that was freed up by the departure of star winger Semi Radradra to French rugby to throw at Cronk. \nThe Eels already had spare salary cap money up their sleeve which, coupled with the money saved on Radradra, takes their war chest to $1million. They are now genuine players in the race for Cronk. \nWhile the Roosters remain firm favourites to sign Cronk, Parramatta's wealth and power would be attractive to the former Storm halfback. \n\"Who wouldn't be interested in Cooper Cronk?\" Eels chairman Max Donnelly said. \n\"Any club that has room to move in the cap would have to at least consider him.\" \nPressed on whether his club had the salary cap room to sign Cronk, Donnelly said: \"I'm not going to go into those operational issues. But we have some room in our cap, yes.\" \nThe Roosters were about $650,000 under the NRL's salary cap ceiling this year. \n\nWell-placed sources revealed that Cronulla were also $1 million under the salary cap and had expressed interest in signing Cronk, who wants to play for another two seasons. \n\"The club wouldn't have to shed any players if they went after Cronk,\" the Sharks source said. \nCronk announced in April that he was moving to Sydney to be closer to fiancee Tara Rushton. The pair have already bought a home in Mosman. \nManly haven't entered the Cronk race but he could be viewed as a replacement for Blake Green, who has attracted interest from the Warriors. \nDean Ritchie",

Contributed Full Profile Login to follow \nTHE New South Wales Government has launched a plan to ensure \"every worker who heads off in the morning returns home safely to their family at night”. \nThe five-year project aims to help protect workers against injuries and diseases from dangerous chemicals in the workplace. \nMinister for Better Regulation Matt Kean said crystalline silica and formaldehyde have been given top priority by the government as those of greatest risk to NSW workers. \nCrystalline silica is a natural substance found in most rocks, sands and clay, and in building products such as bricks, concrete and caesarstone. \nWhen disturbed by blasting, chipping or grinding, crystalline silica dust can get into a worker's lungs and cause the lung disease silicosis. \nFormaldehyde is a colourless, flammable and gaseous substance used in products such as MDF pressed woodboard, glues, embalming fluids and sterilisers in laboratories and funeral homes, and as a disinfectant in farming. \nIt can cause skin, eyes, nose, and throat irritations. \n\"Every worker across this state has the right to a safe and healthy workplace, especially those who work with hazardous chemicals on a daily basis,” Mr Kean said. \n\"More than 10,000 businesses will be visited over the next five years in a concerted effort to eliminate injuries and disease associated with these substances. \n\"Tragically between 2012 and 2015, eight workers died, 6000 were injured, and 250 were permanently disabled in incidents involving hazardous chemicals...SafeWork is committed to driving down that number.” \nMr Kean said SafeWork would engage business, industry and stakeholders over the next five years to improve safety standards and workplace practices while enhancing hazardous chemical laws. \n\"We will work closely with other work health and safety regulators to review national standards and ensure they are in line with international best practice,” he said. \n\"Health monitoring tests will also be reviewed to ensure they are most effective for detecting occupational respiratory diseases.” \nMr Kean said SafeWork is also partnering with iCare's Lung Bus to provide subsidised health monitoring in regional NSW, and rebates are available to small businesses to improve chemical safety. \n\"Whether you are an employer or a worker, and regardless of your industry, occupation or background, workplace safety is everyone's responsibility,” he said. \nFor fact sheets, and to participate in a free webinar, visit the SafeWork NSW website or call 13 10 50.",

      "text": "Bega Cheese talks up balance sheet as Murray Goulburn bid goes down to wire Share Barry Irvine says Bega Cheese is positioned for growth. Louise Kennerley by Brad Thompson \nBega Cheese's chairman says its strong balance sheet puts it in a good position to undertake more acquisitions. \nBut Australia's largest milk processor, Murray Goulburn, was something of an elephant in the room at the Sapphire Coast Turf Club as executive director Barry Irvin reflected on a landmark year for Bega at the company's annual meeting. Shareholders did not raise a single question on the possible transaction. \nMurray Goulburn, which is canvassing offers for its struggling business , could reveal the winner in the sales process on Friday at its annual meeting. \nBega is one of the frontrunners for the whole-of-company acquisition, along with Canada's Saputo. Others thought to have been in contention, but with their odds lengthening, include Fonterra, Parmalat and at least one Chinese group willing to part with $1 billion or more for the co-operative. \nChina's Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group and China Mengniu Dairy have made bids. Related Quotes View all announcements \nMr Irvin told shareholders Bega was well placed for acquisitions after a year marked by the purchase of the Mondelez grocery business, which included Vegemite, the $200 million sale of infant formula processing assets to Mead Johnson and a successful capital raising. \n\"Bega Cheese has always maintained a strong balance sheet, believing that we should be in a position to respond to business opportunities if and when they present themselves,\" he said. \n\"These opportunities will inevitably include both organic growth and acquisitions ... a very strong balance sheet positions us well for growth.\" \nBega would face Australian Competition and Consumer Commission hurdles in acquiring Murray Goulburn , as would other contenders bar the Chinese, but they are not considered insurmountable. Unlike Bega, rival bidders would also need Foreign Investment Review Board approval. \nAnother complication to the sale is two legal claims against Murray Goulburn. The ACCC is taking action in the Federal Court alleging the company engaged in unconscionable conduct and made false or misleading representation to farmers on milk prices it expected to pay in 2015-16. \nIn a separate class action, investors allege the market was misled ahead of Murray Goulburn's float. \nMr Irvin was not asked about Murray Goulburn, or the doubts that have been raised about Bega's capacity to fund the acquisition, during the meeting. Challenging times \nBut he acknowledged it had been a challenging few years for dairy farmers, and welcomed approaches from those wanting to supply Bega. \n\"It is, unfortunately, well documented that strategies or approaches for farm-gate milk price that do not reflect changes in the market are extraordinarily risky,\" he said. \nHe said Bega had long had the benefit of very supportive long-term shareholders, as highlighted by an oversubscribed $172 million capital raising in June. \nSpeaking soon after the capital raising, Bega corporate adviser David Williams said the overwhelming response showed the company could easily raise $500 million for the acquisition of an asset attractive to the market. \nBega set out to raise $122.5 million from institutional ­investors in three days. Kidder Williams, which handled the raising, closed the book before the end of the first day after receiving offers of $625 million. \nMr Irvin said the \"bringing back home of Vegemite\" as part of the Mondelez deal complemented Bega's traditional business and added significant new skills in branding sales and marketing. \n\"The response to the purchase of Vegemite, the opportunities in other products such as peanut butter and the momentum and enthusiasm of the combined teams gives the company great confidence that the decision to pursue this acquisition will bring both financial and cultural rewards,\" he said. \nThe $460 million acquisition was not settled until July 4 after being delayed by a cyber attack on Mondelez. \nThe delay means Bega will not receive the benefit of full-year sales and there will be transaction and implementation costs absorbed by the foods division in 2017-18.

      "text": "Fidelity chief says no tolerance for sexual harassment after firings Fidelity chief says no tolerance for sexual harassment after firings By Tuesday Oct 24, 2017 File Photo BOSTON: Fidelity Investments Chairman Abigail Johnson on Monday urged her employees to take responsibility for their workplace culture after embarrassing reports the mutual fund company dismissed at least two money managers accused of sexual harassment. \n“Today, I’d like to remind everyone that we have no tolerance at our company for any type of harassment,” Johnson told Fidelity’s 40,000-plus staff, according to a person who saw the chairman’s video message. \n“We simply will not, and do not tolerate this type of behavior, from anyone.” \nJohnson’s handling of allegations that Fidelity has a men’s club mentality could prove crucial to reassuring clients she has a firm grip on the company at a time when its actively managed funds face intense competition from rival products. \nHer stern message followed last month’s dismissal of star portfolio manager Gavin Baker, a move approved by Johnson, according to a person familiar with the situation. \nBaker’s $16-billion Over The Counter Portfolio outperformed nearly every large-cap growth fund over the past three years and generated $261.4 million in management fees for Fidelity during that time, according to Fidelity disclosures. \nThe Wall Street Journal, earlier this month, reported the circumstances of Baker’s September dismissal, which was spurred by allegations of sexual harassment against him, according to a person familiar with the situation. Baker denied any wrongdoing. \nOn Sunday, the newspaper reported the dismissal of Robert Chow, a money manager who worked at Fidelity for nearly 30 years. \nChow, who did not return messages seeking comment, was accused of making inappropriate sexual remarks, according to a person familiar with the situation. \nThe allegations coincide with a deluge of sexual harassments complaints against executives in the entertainment industry that has opened a debate about workplace abuse of women. \nOne of the biggest investors in Baker’s former fund — the New York State Deferred Compensation Plan — is weighing whether to replace the Fidelity fund. That process started long before Baker’s ouster and Fidelity was invited to re-bid for the mandate. \nThe New York plan had $2.1 billion invested in the Over The Counter Portfolio at the end of March, according to disclosures by the retirement plan. \nFinal selection is expected in December. \nMatthew Sweeney — a spokesman for the New York plan — declined to comment on the finalists, saying the process was in a restricted period. \nBad press can be a concern to clients considering a new money manager due to performance or fees. \n“You never want to give the client any reason to shift,” Jonathan Morgan — the principal of Sound Fund Advisors in Darien, Connecticut — said. \nLarry Glazer — the managing partner of Boston-based wealth management firm Mayflower Advisors — said the allegations came at a time when Fidelity faces a seismic shift of cash flows into passively managed funds run by competitors like Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. \n“It’s so disruptive. You look at where we are in the bull market, it hasn’t translated into a boom in the active fund industry,” Glazer said. \nIndeed, about $55 billion has been pulled from Fidelity’s actively managed mutual funds over the past year, according to Morningstar data. \nBy contrast, Fidelity’s passive funds, including index and exchange-traded funds, have received $45 billion in net deposits during that time. \nFrancis Byrd — an independent New York-based corporate governance adviser — said Fidelity and Johnson could wind up getting credit from clients for handling the situation decisively. \n“Companies that take decisive action, from a corporate governance perspective, look to be in much better shape than those that don’t,” Byrd said. \n“In an ideal world, there would not be sexual harassment. But we don’t live in a perfect world.” Advertisement",

      "text": "Strategists aren't greeting gains in the ASX with joy. Peter Braig by Sarah Turner Rather than celebrating the ASX's recent solid year-long run, strategists have started to seriously question whether it will continue.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index has climbed 9 per cent in 12 months, and while this pales beside the gains recorded in some global equity markets, it's a solid performance for the Australian market. When dividends are included, shareholders of the broad index have enjoyed returns of 15 per cent.\nThe ASX advance has been made in an environment that's been \"kind to risk assets\" , Deutsche Bank Australian equity strategist Tim Baker said.\n\"Global growth has accelerated while subdued inflation has kept policy tightening at bay. Valuations are high, and volatility is low, both globally and in Australia,\" Mr Baker said.\nBut this environment is set to turn, Mr Baker believes, with policy uncertainty \"quite high\" and central banks set to try to get monetary policy back to more normal settings.\n He questioned whether the ASX could now enter into a period of prolonged losses, or a \"bear market\", given the expected change of backdrop.\nAfter looking across a range of indicators which acted as warning signals in the past he said \"overall, the data suggests that the odds of a bear market in Australia in the next six months are low.\"\nHowever, Goldman Sachs' Australian equity strategist Matthew Ross is cautious about the Australian equity market, despite the bourse's recent powerful run.\nStretched valuations and softening earnings momentum mean the outlook for the market appears challenged, Mr Ross said.\nMore worryingly, the prospect of interest rate hikes has increased in line with brightening prospects for the economy and waning disinflationary forces.\nMr Ross has recently held meetings with investors, where the debate was all about how to defensively position in a dislocated market.\n\"Positioning for a pullback has historically been very simple,\" Mr Ross said, with \"low risk\" stocks significantly outperforming in each of the largest market corrections over the past 25 years.\nHowever, \" given the distortions of unprecedented central bank actions , we doubt this pattern will repeat.\"\nValuations for defensive stocks were a lot more accommodative in prior periods of market weakness and also they're unlikely to get a tailwind from central banks lowering interest rates this time around as most central banks are already at record lows with rates.\nExpensive, highly-leveraged \"defensive\" firms will likely come under pressure in a market downturn for the first time since Mr Ross and colleagues have been collecting data, he noted.\nOptions for investors going forward in this environment include finding a new slew of \"low risk\" stocks and hedging with banks and miners, he suggests.\nBut Mr Baker at Deutsche Bank said that, while valuations are above average on a forward price to earnings basis, Deutsche Bank's fair value model indicates that's justified, he said.\nIn addition, valuations have been \"fairly stable\" over the past six months instead of rising as they have tended to do when approaching bear markets in the past, according to Mr Baker.\nEarnings growth is still holding up, interest rates are low and stable and market leadership is not yet a concern with small caps and value only just beginning to outperform.\n\"Yield curves remain positive, investors are not flocking to safe-haven commodities, the US dollar has fallen and volatility is not picking up,\" Mr Baker said.\n\"We continue to see the S&P/ASX200 at 5900 by year-end and 6000 by June 2018,\" he said. In contrast, Mr Ross's 12-month target for the benchmark measure is 5800 points.",

      "text": "Shedding Some Light on The Fulham Shore Plc (FUL.L)’s Technicals October 24, 2017 EBU Staff Writer \nShares of The Fulham Shore Plc (FUL.L) are moving on volatility today -1.71% or -0.25 from the open. The LSE listed company saw a recent bid of 14.375 on 87322 volume. \nIndividual investors have the tendency to migrate towards certain stock strategies that have been successful in the past. While following previous strategies may be profitable, investors have to be ready for sudden market changes. Most investors will rejoice when stocks in the portfolio catch a hot streak. On the opposite side, investors may become highly dejected when they experience a prolonged losing streak. Sometimes, previously successful strategies run their course and they no longer work. Investors may benefit greatly from being able to make adjustments when the market takes a turn for the worse. \nTurning to Return on Assets or ROA, The Fulham Shore Plc ( FUL.L) has a current ROA of 1.72. This is a profitability ratio that measures net income generated from total company assets during a given period. This ratio reveals how quick a company can turn it’s assets into profits. In other words, the ratio provides insight into the profitability of a firm’s assets. The ratio is calculated by dividing total net income by the average total assets. \nA higher ROA compared to peers in the same industry, would suggest that company management is able to effectively generate profits from their assets. Similar to the other ratios, a lower number might raise red flags about management’s ability when compared to other companies in a similar sector. \nNow let’s take a look at how the fundamentals are stacking up for The Fulham Shore Plc ( FUL.L) . Fundamental analysis takes into consideration market, industry and stock conditions to help determine if the shares are correctly valued. The Fulham Shore Plc currently has a yearly EPS of 0.20. This number is derived from the total net income divided by shares outstanding. In other words, EPS reveals how profitable a company is on a share owner basis. \nAnother key indicator that can help investors determine if a stock might be a quality investment is the Return on Equity or ROE. The Fulham Shore Plc ( FUL.L) currently has Return on Equity of 2.52. ROE is a ratio that measures profits generated from the investments received from shareholders. \nIn other words, the ratio reveals how effective the firm is at turning shareholder investment into company profits. A company with high ROE typically reflects well on management and how well a company is run at a high level. A firm with a lower ROE might encourage potential investors to dig further to see why profits aren’t being generated from shareholder money. Another ratio we can look at is the Return on Invested Capital or more commonly referred to as ROIC. The Fulham Shore Plc ( FUL.L) has a current ROIC of 2.25. ROIC is calculated by dividing Net Income – Dividends by Total Capital Invested. Similar to ROE, ROIC measures how effectively company management is using invested capital to generate company income. A high ROIC number typically reflects positively on company management while a low number typically reflects the opposite. \nInvesting in the stock market has traditionally offered higher returns than other types of investments. With the higher potential for returns, there is also a higher risk factor. Investors typically need to address their own personal risk situation before jumping into the market. Figuring out risk appetite can help when choosing which types of stocks to buy. Some investors will decide that they want to take a chance on certain stocks that have the potential to outperform in the future. Other investors may opt to play it safe and build a portfolio with low risk, staple stocks. Leave a Comment",

      "text": "Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average Trending Higher for Aileron Therapeutics Inc (ALRN) October 24, 2017 Searcy Contributor \nFocusing in on the signals for Aileron Therapeutics Inc (ALRN), we have recently seen that the Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average is trending up over the last five days. Traders may be following this reading to spot near-term positive momentum on shares. \nInterested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. Aileron Therapeutics Inc (ALRN)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -84.68. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold. \nKeeping an eye on moving averages for Aileron Therapeutics Inc (ALRN), the 50-day is 12.90, the 200-day is at 5.27, and the 7-day is 13.88. Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. After a recent check, the 14-day RSI is currently at 47.91, the 7-day stands at 34.60, and the 3-day is sitting at 10.03. \nWe can also take a look at the Average Directional Index or ADX of Aileron Therapeutics Inc (ALRN). The ADX is used to measure trend strength. ADX calculations are made based on the moving average price range expansion over a specified amount of time. ADX is charted as a line with values ranging from 0 to 100. The indicator is non-directional meaning that it gauges trend strength whether the stock price is trending higher or lower. The 14-day ADX sits at 18.31. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would indicate a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would signify an extremely strong trend. \nAileron Therapeutics Inc (ALRN) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -160.96. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. Leave a Comment",

      "text": "Chartists Taking Aim at China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SNP) Shares October 23, 2017 EBU Staff Writer \nChina Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SNP) touched 73.42 on a recent bid indicating that the Tenkan line is still hovering below the Kijun Sen. This represents bearish momentum for the shares. Whether or not the shares are ready to break further to the downside is yet to be seen. \nThe Tenkan Sen / Kijun Sen Cross signal occurs when the Tenkan Sen (Turning line) crosses the Kijun Sen (Standard line). A bearish signal occurs when the Tenkan Sen crosses from above to below the Kijun Sen. The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system includes five kinds of signal, of which this site highlights the most recent of each for each ticker. \nThe Ichimoku signals, including all Ichimoku elements, should never be taken in isolation, but considered in the context of the overall chart. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a visual technical analysis system and the charts are designed to be considered in their entirety, with regard given to the relationships between all of the elements, including the price. As such, Ichimoku is not suitable for automated or “single event” decision making. \nActive traders have a wide range of additional technical indicators at their disposal for when completing technical stock analysis. Currently, the 14-day ATR for China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SNP) is spotted at 0.95. First developed by J. Welles Wilder, the ATR may assist traders in determining if there is heightened interest in a trend, or if extreme levels may be signaling a reversal. Simply put, the ATR determines the volatility of a security over a given period of time, or the tendency of the security to move one direction or another. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 38.99, the 7-day stands at 33.99, and the 3-day is sitting at 27.14. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970’s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SNP) is noted at 11.94. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SNP) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -86.87. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nChina Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SNP) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -169.42. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nOne of the most famous sayings in the stock market is “buy low, sell high”. This may seem like an oversimplified statement, but there are many novice investors who often do the complete opposite. Many investors may be looking too closely at stocks that have been on the rise, and they might not be checking on the underlying fundamental data. They may be hoping to ride the wave higher, but may end up shaking their heads. On the flip side, many investors may hold onto stocks for far too long after they have slipped drastically. Waiting for a bounce that may never come can cause frustration and plenty of second guessing. Successful investors are typically able to locate stocks that are undervalued at a certain price. This may take a lot of practice and dedication, but it may do wonders for the health of the portfolio. Leave a Comment",

      "text": "Angela Castles / Monday, October 23, 2017 \nAustralian startups are raising on average $645,500 in funding rounds in return for an average 13% equity stake in their businesses, according to data collected by legal startup LawPath. \nLaunched in 2013, LawPath provides a cloud-based legal platform for startups and businesses to access legal advice and services, and its chief Dominic Woolrych says it is experiencing 20% month-on-month revenue growth, while bringing on 2000 new clients a month. \nOver the past two years, the startup has leveraged this rapidly expanding user base to collect and anonymise data from roughly 5000 capital raise documents. Through this process, LawPath found the average amount startups had raised from investors in this time was $645,500, while the average equity stake taken in the startups by investors was 13%. \nThe total amount invested into startups across these raises was $109.1 million dollars, and the average associated expenses of raising funding was found to be $9317. \nLawPath collected these 10 million units of anonymised legal data from its clients in an effort to provide a snapshot of the Australian startup landscape — from how much startups are raising, to how how long they’re keeping interns on board. \n“We are leveraging this data to help new clients, who often don’t know how much to raise, or how much to give out in equity,” Woolrych tells StartupSmart . \n“We thought, if we say to them, ‘the last 5000 startups of your size did this’, then that’s really going to help them.” \nWoolrych says all the data LawPath uses for analysis is anonymised and cannot be matched back or identified to the client. \nThe startup sees a range of both early and late-stage companies processing capital raise documents through the platform, and Woolrych says the average raise of an early-stage startup sits around $250,000, while later-stage startups typically raise up to $1 million in funding rounds. \nSince LawPath started collecting and analysing its user data, Woolrych says he has anecdotally noticed a “definite” increase in the average amount of funding startups are raising. \n“Over the last two years as the startup scene has continued to heat up so has the investment scene and the corporates coming in to invest,” he says. \nWoolrych says even early-stage raises where family and friends contribute funding have grown in size in recent times. \n“ Friends and family early stage rounds were previously around $50,000 and now it’s uncommon to see rounds of that size; you almost always see them over $100,000 now,” he says. \nWoolrych says his team has also seen a change in the types of shares being issued. Whereas once LawPath would see primarily preference shares being issued in funding rounds, he says the team is now seeing more ordinary shares issued. \n“This suggests that startups are starting to get more power in the relationship and investors aren’t dictating all the terms,” he says. \nStartups may also be keeping interns on longer than may be legal, Woolrych observes, pointing to LawPath data that shows the average term of intern agreements is five months, while “it’s not uncommon” for agreements to last for over 12 months. \n“This is interesting from a legal perspective, because the general rule is no more than three months — otherwise it’s seen as an employment relationship,” he says, adding LawPath can now use this data to warn future startup clients about these requirements. The value of data \nWoolrych says the data collected will now be used to help the startups that use LawPath services to make more informed decisions about the legal considerations they need to be aware of. \n“In the startup space the VCs have data, incubators have data, but on the legal side there’s no data out there,” he says. \n“I think it [collecting data] is really important at the moment because there’s a lot of support for startups out there but it’s still relatively difficult for startups to get information about capital raises,” he says. \n“Startups often don’t want to give away share price or valuation. It’s hard to get a grasp of what’s fair, and that’s why data is so important, because you can look back and see on a larger scale what’s happening.” \nFollow StartupSmart on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn and iTunes .

      "text": "Mach7 Technologies Limited (M7T.AX): Numbers in Focus October 24, 2017 Standard Staff Writer \nAfter a recent check, we have noted that the KAMA has been trending higher over the prior five trading periods for Mach7 Technologies Limited (M7T.AX). Traders keeping an eye on the signal might be watching for a possible positive shift in near-term momentum. \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings. The 14-day RSI is presently standing at 49.08, the 7-day is 46.46, and the 3-day is resting at 36.77. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 0.25, the 50-day is 0.16, and the 7-day is resting at 0.16. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA’s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action. \nSome investors may find the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R as a helpful technical indicator. Presently, Mach7 Technologies Limited (M7T.AX)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at -66.67. Values can range from 0 to -100. A reading between -80 to -100 may be typically viewed as strong oversold territory. A value between 0 to -20 would represent a strong overbought condition. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. \nTaking a look at another technical level, Mach7 Technologies Limited (M7T.AX) presently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -35.00. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970’s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Mach7 Technologies Limited (M7T.AX) is noted at 27.98. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. Leave a Comment",

      "text": "Aquila Resources Inc (AQARF): KAMA Trending Higher on This Stock October 24, 2017 PR Staff \nFocusing in on the signals for Aquila Resources Inc (AQARF), we have recently seen that the Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average is trending up over the last five days. Traders may be following this reading to spot near-term positive momentum on shares. \nInterested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. Aquila Resources Inc (AQARF)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -60.12. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold. \nKeeping an eye on moving averages for Aquila Resources Inc (AQARF), the 50-day is 0.20, the 200-day is at 0.19, and the 7-day is 0.20. Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. After a recent check, the 14-day RSI is currently at 50.95, the 7-day stands at 47.63, and the 3-day is sitting at 30.92. \nWe can also take a look at the Average Directional Index or ADX of Aquila Resources Inc (AQARF). The ADX is used to measure trend strength. ADX calculations are made based on the moving average price range expansion over a specified amount of time. ADX is charted as a line with values ranging from 0 to 100. The indicator is non-directional meaning that it gauges trend strength whether the stock price is trending higher or lower. The 14-day ADX sits at 16.68. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would indicate a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would signify an extremely strong trend. \nAquila Resources Inc (AQARF) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 95.29. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.

      "text": "Just the Fundamentals: Checking in on Dewmar International Bmc Inc (DEWM) October 23, 2017 Nelson Research Staff \nFundamentals consist of quantitative and qualitative information that create the foundation of economic health and, followingly, the financial strength of a security, company, or currency. Analysts and investors investigate a company’s fundamentals in order to glean an understanding of the asset’s worth. From a business perspective, information such as growth, liabilities, assets, revenue, and earnings compose a company’s fundamentals. Strong fundamentals means that a business has a solid financial foundation, while those companies with shaky fundamentals will have issues. Businesses that have solid fundamentals are more likely to navigate through the negative times, like recessions or depressions, than those companies with weak ones fundamentals. Strong fundamentals indicate that a company is less risky to invest in. \nA 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest share price that a stock has traded at during the previous year. Investors and traders consider the 52-week high or low as a crucial factor in determining a given stock’s current value while also predicting future price movements. When a commodity trades within its 52-week price range (the range that exists between the 52-week low and the 52-week high), investors usually show more interest as the price nears either the high or the low. \nOne of the more popular strategies used by traders is to buy when the price eclipses its 52-week high or to sell when the price drops below its 52-week low. The rationale involved with this strategy says that if the price breaks out either above or below the 52-week range, there is momentum enough to continue the price fluctuation in a positive direction. Dewmar International Bmc Inc (DEWM)’s high over the last year was $0.0039 while its low was $0.0032. \nDewmar International Bmc Inc (DEWM)’s previous close was $0.0037. Previous close refers to the prior day’s value of a given security. When comparing a security’s closing price from one day to the next, investors can see how the price has changed over time. \nA negative change indicates declining performance while a positive change indicates an improved performance. Interpretation change can be left to the analyst. The formula for finding change is by subtracting the previous time period from the most recent time period. \nIf a company trades at $20 at the end of the first quarter and $40 at the end of the second quarter, the change $40 minus $20, or $20. Here we find the change to be positive, but by how much? The price went up from $20 to $40, so it doubled. \nIn this example, the company’s stock price grew 100% in the first quarter. Investors like change. Change allows investors to make a profit. In volatile markets, there are many opportunities for investors to make up for losses. Prices are based on the change in price of assets. Value is based on changing prices. “Calls” make a bet that the price of the asset will increase, while “puts” bet that the price of the asset will go decrease. More volatility means that there is more likely a chance for investors to make a profit. Their change was $-0.0003 and total volume was 10630059. \nStandard Deviation is a measure of the current average variability of return. A move of (plus or minus) 1 std deviation means a 33% odds for a major price move, whereas a move of (plus or minus) 3 std deviations means a 1% odds for a major price move. Dewmar International Bmc Inc (DEWM)’s Standard Deviation is -1.06. \nWeighted Alpha is a measure of how much a stock has risen or fallen over a one-year period with a higher weighting for recent price activity. Dewmar International Bmc Inc (DEWM)’s Weighted Alpha is -60.68. \nThere are three methods used to interpret the MACD. The first is “Crossovers”. When the MACD falls below the signal line, it is bearish, indicating that it might be time to sell. When the MACD shoots above the signal line, the indicator is bullish, indicating that the price of the commodity is probably going to experience upward momentum. The second method is “Divergence”, meaning that when the price of the security diverges from the MACD, it signals the end of the current trend. Lastly, there is the “Dramatic Rise”. When the MACD experiences a dramatic rise, the signal indicates overbought status and will probably soon return to more normal levels. The 9-day difference between a short-term and long-term moving average. A value above 0 indicates a bullish signal while a value below 0 interprets as a bearish signal. Dewmar International Bmc Inc (DEWM)’s 9-Day MACD is -0.0009 and its 14-Day MACD is -0.0013. Dewmar International Bmc Inc (DEWM)’s TrendSpotter Opinion, the signal from Trendspotter, a Barchart trend analysis system that uses wave theory, market momentum & volatility in an attempt to find a general trend, is Sell. \nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

      "text": "Plexure Group Ltd (PLX.NZ) Tenkan Sitting Below Kijun Oct 23, 2017 Herald Staff \nPlexure Group Ltd (PLX.NZ)’s moving averages reveal that the Tenkan line of the shares are below the Kijun-Sen line, indicating potential downward momentum building in the bearish chart. Plexure Group Ltd moved 0.002 in the most recent session and touched 0.097 on a recent tick. \nThe Tenkan-Sen is generally used in combination with the Kijun-Sen to create predications of future momentum. A buy signal is created when the Tenkan-sen line moves above the Kijun-Sen, while a sell signal is created when the Tenkan-Sen line moves below the Kijun-Sen line. \nMany technical traders use the Tenkan-Sen as a tool for predicting levels where the price of the asset will find short-term support. \nWhen reading Ichimoku Kinko Hyo charts, investors should note that the Tenkan-Sen line leads the Kijun-Sen, and tracks price with more sensitivity because it covers a shorter period of time. When the Tenkan-Sen line crosses and moves above the Kijun-Sen line, this is generally considered a bullish signal. Alternatively, when the Tenkan-Sen line crosses below the Kijun-Sen line, it is considered a bearish signal. \nThe tenkan sen/kijun sen cross is one of the most traditional trading strategies within the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system. The signal for this strategy is given when the tenkan sen crosses over the kijun sen. If the tenkan sen crosses above the kijun sen, then it is a bullish signal. Likewise, if the tenkan sen crosses below the kijun sen, then that is a bearish signal. Like all strategies within the Ichimoku system, the tenkan sen/kijun sen cross needs to be viewed in terms of the bigger Ichimoku picture before making any trading decisions, as this will give the strategy the best chances of success. In general, the tenkan sen/kijun sen strategy can be classified into three (3) major classifications: strong, neutral and weak. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is an additional technical indicator worth taking a look at. Plexure Group Ltd (PLX.NZ) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -95.35. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nAnother technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970’s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Plexure Group Ltd (PLX.NZ) is noted at 20.38. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nInvestors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Plexure Group Ltd (PLX.NZ) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -80.61. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions. \nTaking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 31.94, the 7-day sits at 23.83 and the 14-day (most common) is at 34.69. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems”. \nKeeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 0.12, the 200-day is at 0.20, and the 7-day is 0.10 for Plexure Group Ltd (PLX.NZ). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time. Share",

Ltd (ASX: AFI) (AFIC) is the biggest listed investment company in Australia. \nIts focus has always been on the big blue chips like Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) , Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) , Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES) , Telstra Corporation Ltd (ASX: TLS) and BHP Billiton Limited (ASX: BHP) . \nThe returns that AFIC has generated over the past five years have been pretty good. It has created an average return of 9.7% per annum. When you include franking credits the average return per annum was 10.7%. \nThe problem with this type of investment strategy is that many of the biggest businesses have structural problems to deal with and this is where most of AFIC’s money is invested. \nThe big four banks are required to hold more capital so that they are stronger if trouble occurs. Wesfarmers has Amazon to contend with. Telstra has a lot to worry about with the NBN. The resources boom has been finished for a long time. \nTherefore, I was pleased to see that AFIC has paid a bit of attention to the changing landscape in its annual general meeting presentation, which was posted to the ASX recently. It said that the team would be taking more of a focus on the changes and opportunities that are going to occur such as Amazon, data growth or ageing demographics. \nIt’s a shift towards smaller, faster growing companies that will make sure AFIC at least stays up with the market. The big companies of Australia have big targets on their backs. \nIf AFIC can position more of its portfolio towards shares like Ramsay Health Care Limited (ASX: RHC) and Treasury Wine Estates Ltd (ASX: TWE) then it should have a bright future. \nFoolish takeaway \nAFIC will be making the right moves if it starts positioning its portfolio for this uncertain future. The shares AFIC intends to move towards should be good long-term options. \nIt’s currently trading with a grossed-up dividend yield of 5.77%. \nOUR #1 dividend pick to grow your wealth over the new financial year is revealed for FREE here! \nFinancial year 2018 is here and The Motley Fool's dividend detective Andrew Page has revealed his must buy dividend share to grow your wealth in 2018. \nYou might not know this market leader, but it's making waves in Asia and already boasts a term-deposit-crushing dividend above 4% .

SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Solomon Lew drastically stepped up his attack on Myer, threatening to call an early general meeting to get board seats. \n\"If he genuinely was seeking to build some sort of relation with the company, he couldn't have done it worse,\" Myer chairman Paul McClintock told Fairfax Media. \n\"The behaviour of Premier since they arrived has been aggressive and disruptive, and I think the chances of actually being able to incorporate a representative of that group in the company, and expect the board to keep a sense of cohesion and a sense of unity with the management… I think it would be serious disruption, and I see no value in doing so.\" Related Articles Myer chairman says 500,000 shares shows 'conviction' \nPremier Investments, Myer's largest investor with 10.8 per cent of shares, on Tuesday revealed Mr Lew met Myer's incoming chairman Garry Hounsell on October 6 to ask for two board seats and the appointment of a independent non-executive director. \nThe request was refused, and six days later Myer appointed to the board Julie Ann Morrison, who Premier pointedly described as a former director of Myer's \"failed\" Sass & Bide business. Advertisement \n\"Mr Hounsell then inferred to the media that he was yet to meet with Mr Lew,\" Premier said in a statement to the ASX.

By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nMr McClintock said Premier had no right to board representation, and that there would be conflict of interests given Premier and other companies linked to Mr Lew were major competitors and suppliers to Myer. \nAsked why conflicts of interest could not be dealt with under related party rules, Mr McClintock said: \"But why would you?\" \n\"They have ambitions of effectively taking control of the company. The basic rule of any ASX chairman is to make sure that if people outside want to take control of the company, they pay a proper premium and every shareholder gets the benefit.\" \nMr McClintock said that far from refusing access to Mr Lew as Premier has alleged, he had twice invited Mr Lew to meet the whole Myer board. The offers were declined, Mr McClintock said. \n\"When you stand in front of Mr Lew, traditionally you have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen,\" he said. \"I think this has been a train wreck that has been coming for a while, and we're dealing with it professionally. \nWhen you stand in front of Mr Lew, traditionally you have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen. Paul McClintock, Myer chairman \n\"The real issue here is, is there any justification in a company like Premier being given a very large measure of control over an ASX listed company, and if so why would you do that?\" \nMr Lew said in a letter to fellow Myer shareholders on Tuesday that \"enough is enough\" and that Myer's board needed the retail experience Premier could offer. \n\"How can the directors possibly advise management and keep them on their toes?\" Mr Lew said. \n\"As Myer shareholders we deserve better. Myer customers deserve better. The Australian fashion industry deserves better.\" \nPremier would reserve the right to call an extraordinary general meeting in the short term so shareholders could vote on its own nominees, it said.

      "text": "Privacy Policy Bh Global Limited (BHGG.L) Shares Needle Moving 0.00% \nShares of Bh Global Limited (BHGG.L) have seen the needle move 0.00% or 0.00 in the most recent session. The LSE listed company saw a recent bid of $1333.00 on 33027 volume. \nDedicated investors often strive hard to set themselves up for success. Finding long-lasting success in the stock market may not be an easy endeavor. The mindset of a short-term trader may differ greatly from that of a long-term investor. Investors often have to be prepared for many different situations. Obtaining the proper knowledge about stocks and the investing world is typically a main goal for active traders and investors. Once the investor is armed with knowledge, they may be able to see things that others cannot. This may involve staying up to date on various fundamentals, technicals, and macro-economic conditions. \nTaking a deeper look into the technical levels of Bh Global Limited ( BHGG.L), we can see that the Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -80.00 . The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. \nBh Global Limited (BHGG.L) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -52.84 . Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. After a recent check, Bh Global Limited’s 14-day RSI is currently at 45.35 , the 7-day stands at 42.03 , and the 3-day is sitting at 38.92 . \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Bh Global Limited (BHGG.L) is sitting at 16.84 . Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 1302.42, the 50-day is 1339.91, and the 7-day is resting at 1334.36. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA’s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action. \nNew investors may be looking at the soaring stock market and wondering if now is a good time to try and get in on the action. Leaping into the market without proper research or a solid plan may leave the investor on the short end of the stick. Creating a stock investing plan can be as simple or complex as the individual chooses. Sometimes, keeping things simple may be the best way to go. Other times, there may be more than meets the eye, and a deep-dive into the crucial data may be required. New investors may be extremely excited to start buying stocks. They may have heard some great water cooler talk about the next big stock. There is always a possibility that the hot stock chatter may end up coming to fruition, but it could just as likely turn out to be terribly erroneous. Many individuals in the financial world will be quick to provide these can’t lose picks, but until this information is thoroughly researched, investors may want to proceed with caution. \nBy Benton Contributor",

      "text": "Power bills set to soar almost $2000 over next decade 24th Oct 2017 7:25 AM Use this content by The Australian \nHOUSEHOLD power bills would soar almost $200 per year for a decade under federal Labor's plan for a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. \nThat's according to modelling commissioned by the Climate Change Authority, which also showed almost all of Australia's 16 coal-fired power stations would have to close to meet the party's target. \nIt's the first indication of the costs of federal Labor's energy policy, and comes as the Turnbull Government urges state premiers to support its recently announced National Energy Guarantee. \nThe Australian reports the CCA modelling showed household energy bills would increase by $1921 over 10 years from 2020 to 2030 if an emissions intensity scheme was introduced that aimed to achieve a 52 per cent renewable energy target. \nThat's the closest model to Labor's target yet. The power station in Mannering Park will be the next to come offline after Liddell. Once it closes, the land will be used for a $30m solar farm. Picture: AAP \nIt showed the annual rise in electricity bills would start at about $100 a year in 2020 and peak at $285 a year in 2027. \nThe modelling, which was initially provided to the government in a briefing note on the Climate Change Authority's 2016 report on Policy Options for Australia's Electricity Supply Sector, also showed Australia would need to cut about 17,000 megawatts of black and brown coal-fired power generation out of the market by 2030. \nAccording to The Australian that would mean closing all but one or two of Australia's coal-fired power plants. \nEnergy Minister Josh Frydenberg told the publication the CCA modelling exposed Labor's \"hypocrisy\" over energy policy. All but one or two of Australia’s coal-fired power stations would be closed in favour of renewable energy sources under the plan. Picture: Tom Huntley \nHe accused the party, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. \n\"The only reason why Labor hasn't modelled its emission intensity scheme is because it will drive up household bills by an average of almost $200 per year,\" Mr Frydenberg told The Australian. \n\"That's more than a $300-a-year difference to the Turnbull government's National Energy Guarantee, which will deliver affordable and reliable power. \n\"A family in Newcastle who are already paying $1500 a year for their power cannot afford a $200 increase in their bill. Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg has accused Labor, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. Picture Kym Smith \n\"Labor has been calling for a bipartisan national policy based on expert advice. \n\"Now this is on the table this is a test of Bill Shorten's mettle. \n\"This is his chance to put aside the climate wars of the past.\" \nModelling for the Coalition's NEG shows it would likely cut average household power bills by up to $115 per year over a decade to 2030. \nThe federal government will put its NEG plan before state premiers at a Coalition of Australian Governments meeting next month. \nPremiers must sign off on the plan for it to go ahead. \nAhead of the meeting, Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott yesterday sent letters to the premiers urging them to support the plan.

      "text": "Home » Uncategorized » The Latest: Activists say malnutrition on rise in Damascus The Latest: Activists say malnutrition on rise in Damascus \nBEIRUT (AP) — The Latest on developments in Syria (all times local): \n1:15 p.m. \nSyrian opposition activists say malnutrition and shortages in medicine are increasing the suffering in besieged, rebel-held eastern suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus, adding that two children have died as a result in the past two months. \nThe activists blame a four-year government siege and greed by local businessmen who hide food and medical products in orders to raise the prices, for the malnutrition mostly among children. \nThe crisis in the suburbs, also known as eastern Ghouta have worsened since May after government forces seized the Qaboun and Barzeh neighborhoods in northeast Damascus. The two neighborhoods were hubs for smuggling supplies into the Ghouta region through tunnels. \nInternational aid organizations have been sending food to Ghouta, home to tens of thousands, but the last convoy entered more than a month ago. \nRami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the main reason behind the suffering is the government siege. adding that there are businessmen who are taking advantage of the food shortage. \nAhmad Khansour, a Ghouta-based opposition activist, said via text messages that high prices are far beyond people’s reach, saying that a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar is selling for up to $12 while a kilogram of rice sells for nearly 5$. He said the family’s monthly income is about $100. \n___ \n12:45 p.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says an operation to implement a “de-escalation” zone in Syria’s northern Idlib province is “to a great extent complete.” \nAddressing legislators from his ruling party in parliament on Tuesday, Erdogan suggested that Turkish troops could now target Syria’s border region of Afrin, which is controlled by Syrian Kurdish groups. Turkey considers the Syrian militia to be terrorists because of their links to Kurdish rebels fighting Turkey. \n“We have the issue of Afrin ahead of us,” Erdogan said. “We cannot make any concessions. As we have said before, we may arrive suddenly one night; we may hit (them) suddenly one night.” \nTurkey sent troops into Syria earlier this month to set up “observation posts” in the border province that is dominated by al-Qaida linked militants as part of a deal reached with Russia and Iran. \n___ \n11:40 p.m. \nSyria’s state TV says warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group have bombed a government-controlled neighborhood in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour killing 14 civilians. \nU.S. military spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon denied the report in a tweet saying that the coalition has not bombed the city, of which IS currently controls a small part, since September. \nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a Monday night airstrike killed 22, adding that the identity of the warplanes was not immediately clear. \nSyrian troops have been marching against IS in eastern Syria under the cover of Russian airstrikes. \nLast year, the U.S.-led coalition bombed Syrian army positions near the city of Deir el-Zour killing at least 62 Syrian soldiers and leaving more than a 100 wounded. \n___ \n10:45 a.m. \nRussia’s defense minister says less than five percent of Syria remains under control of the Islamic State group. \nAt the height of the rise of the IS the militants controlled about half of the territory of Syria before their downfall began. \nSpeaking at a conference in the Philippines, Sergei Shoigu said on Monday that “terrorists” controlled more than 70 percent of the country before Russia launched its air operation at the end of 2015 to support President Bashar Assad’s offensive against IS militants and opposition forces. \nRussian airstrikes destroyed more than 900 training camps and a multitude of heavy weaponry. \nIn recent weeks Russia focused efforts on the east of the country where a race is underway between U.S.-backed Syrian forces and government troops in the oil-rich Deir el-Zour province.

Fedpol. Photo: Andrew Meares  Photo: Andrew Meares And two weeks after those hearings, the court will rule on Friday at 2.15pm on Mr Joyce's fate, and that of six senators: Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash, former Nationals cabinet minister Matt Canavan, former Greens senators Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam, One Nation's Malcolm Roberts and NXT leader Nick Xenophon.\nIf a byelection is ordered in Mr Joyce's northern NSW seat of New England, the earliest the poll can be held is December 2.\nAs the only lower house MP, and with the Turnbull government holding just 76 seats in the 150-member lower house, it is Mr Joyce's case the government is most concerned about, although independent MP Cathy McGowan said on Tuesday that she would continue to support the government, which gives the Coalition some breathing room.\nFairfax Media spoke to half a dozen Nationals MPs on Tuesday and the prevailing view was that Mr Joyce, who referred himself to the Court in August when he learnt he was a New Zealander by descent through his father James, is that a byelection is increasingly likely.\nAdvertisement \"That fact that it has taken so long for the court to make its ruling doesn't bode well,\" one MP, who asked not to be named, said, \"and all sorts of theories are sweeping the place.\"\n\"Let's get through to Friday and see what happens,\" said another MP. \"The fact it has taken two weeks is a worry. Confidence has been eaten away as the days have gone by.\"\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly said that, based on the advice of the Solicitor-General, \"We are very, very confident that our members who have been caught up in this will be held by the court to be eligible to sit in the Parliament and therefore eligible to be ministers.\"\nB ut another Nationals source said that the two-week delay in the ruling could favour Mr Joyce as a \"black letter law\" decision against the Nationals leader would likely have been made quickly.\nWhile confidence is falling in government ranks that the court will rule favourably for Mr Joyce, to a person Nationals MPs believe Mr Joyce would win a byelection that could feature a Melbourne Cup field of candidates from Labor, One Nation, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, and possibly former New England independent and political foe Tony Windsor.\nIf Mr Joyce loses his seat, Nationals Senate leader Nigel Scullion is the next in line to take over by dint of seniority, even though he is in the upper house and the Coalition will likely face at least one sitting week without Mr Joyce as lower house leader.\nInfrastructure Minister Darren Chester and Small Business Minister Michael McCormack are both seen as future leaders of the Nationals and are in the lower house.\nABC psephologist Antony Green told Fairfax Media that December 2 was the most likely date should a byelection be ordered, but December 9 was possible if a Queensland state election was called for November 25.",

Some are even questioning the legitimacy of the Labour-led government. \nIt’s worth checking out a basic but ingenious explanation of MMP coalition government from the following Facebook post from Eva Allan : “Allow me to explain MMP: There's one mince and cheese pie left in the shop it costs $5. Bill has $4.50. Jacinda has $3.70. Winston has 70c. James has 60c and David has 5c. No one has enough money to buy the pie by themselves but Jacinda, Winston and James put their money together and buy the pie. Bill gets no pie because he needed 50c but didn't have any friends to help him pay for the pie. I hope this helps explain things.” \nLegitimacy challenged This Facebook post has been a hit, and the reason it has resonated so strongly is there are still plenty of loud challenges being made to the legitimacy of the new government. The fact that the three parties that came second, third, and fourth in the election have been able to combine to get a majority in Parliament is, of course, a new phenomenon. New Zealand hasn’t seen this under MMP yet, although it was always going to eventually. \nIn fact, having the biggest party get 44% of the vote and not be in government is incredibly rare, even in other countries with proportional representation. Jane Clifton has been searching around and found that “the only other time it has happened was in Sweden in the 1970s” – see her latest column, Minority Rules: Who will be the first voted off Coalition Island . \nFor the most colourful and interesting challenge to the legitimacy of the new government, see Richard Prebble’s column, Jacinda Ardern will regret this coalition of losers . Prebble makes the astonishing allegation: “There has been a coup. The political scientists can tell us it's legal but the fact remains – it is undemocratic. For the first time in our history who governs us is not the result of an election but the decision of one man. Jacinda Ardern is prime minister in name only. The only real power that the prime minister has is to allocate portfolios.” \nMr Prebble goes further with the hyperbole, saying that “New Zealand is now a shogunate. In Japan, the emperor had the title and the shogun had all the power.” \nThis column has received an exasperated reply from Chris Trotter, who says “there is not a word of truth in any of this”, and he suggests Mr Prebble knows this and is simply trying to lay the ground for a counter-coup in which the new government is brought down – see: Dark transactions: Winston Peters decision to “Go Left” has already set his enemies in motion . \nMr Prebble’s eccentric arguments aren’t entirely marginal – in fact they’re broadly in line with a media that has given considerable weight to the idea that National has a “moral authority” or mandate to govern due to enjoying greater popularity than Labour. \nThis is actually best conveyed on the front page of The Australian newspaper, which had a large headline declaring “NZ Shock: Losers take power.” You can see this front page and others in my blog post: Newspaper frontpages on the New Zealand election and new government . \nAlthough the Australian newspaper might simply be ignorant of the local constitutional reality in New Zealand, much of the New Zealand media also pushed a similar line about National’s position. \nNewspaper front pages in this country were very one-sided after the election, suggesting National had “won” and that it was almost a formality that New Zealand First would put National back into office. \nIn fact, the Sunday Star-Times editorial after the election said: “Let us be clear: Mr Peters has no choice. The voting public cannot, and will not, tolerate him abusing his kingmaker position by swinging his support behind Ms Ardern, when she is trailing 13 seats behind National. Some will be happy with this outcome; some disappointed. But the result is clear and unequivocal. A record 2.5 million New Zealanders voted. An unprecedented 1.2 million voted for National” – see Jonathan Milne’s Voters cannot, and will not, tolerate Winston abusing his kingmaker position . \nArguments against the 'moral authority' line \nAs Eva Allan’s Facebook post conveys, the simple answer to those who dispute the legitimacy of the new government is to point out that the National Party doesn’t have the necessary majority of seats in Parliament whereas the combined three parties of government do. Bryan Gould points out “The only thing that matters – as it always does under any voting system in a Westminster-style parliament – is that it must be able to win crucial votes in Parliament – that is, it must have a parliamentary majority. How that majority is made up, and whether or not it includes the largest party, is completely irrelevant. A coalition of (let us say) the five smallest parties in parliament would be perfectly legitimate, as long as it commanded a majority” – see: How MMP is meant to work . \nSimilarly, MMP campaigner Hans Grueber says, “It does not matter if the majority is reached by one, two, three or any number of parties as long as they together represent the majority of the voters. That is why a proportional system is regarded as the most democratic. Majority rules. There is nothing undemocratic about the fact that the voters have decided not to give one party an absolute majority but spread their votes among four parties in the clear expectation that these parties would have to compromise and work together to form a coalition to reach a majority in Parliament” – see: Nothing says the largest party has moral right to govern . \nHowever, the best refutation of the “moral authority” argument has been made in a stream of tweets by Michael Appleton‏ (@michelappleton). Not only does he make logical arguments about the legitimacy of the new government but Mr Appleton also calculates how much popular support this government has compared to previous ones. He finds that the Ardern administration “represents a higher proportion of Kiwi voters” than two-thirds of governments since 1936. For ease of reading, I have compiled all of his tweets in one blog post: Has the new NZ government been installed by an undemocratic coup? A Twitter reply . \nSo why has the media given so much weight to the idea that the party with the most seats should govern? Public law expert Edward Willis has blogged on “Why the media got it wrong” (as well as why they are wrong) – see: Why being the largest party matters (and why it doesn't) . \nWillis has two possible answers – one is that the media deemed accuracy less important than the need for copy and controversy, and the second is “the issue is a subtle one, and the news media isn't adept at drawing distinctions between political and constitutional questions.” \nFinally, for a further dose of the “moral authority” argument – including from National's Northland MP Matt King – see Laura Macdonald’s MMP attacked online after coalition formed .

Recent research by the NZCTU shows that between 1998 and 2015 hourly wages rose twice as fast for those at the top of the wage range, compared to those below the average. And the big driver of any increases for those on the lowest wages was increases to the minimum wage. \n“This will make a huge difference to the dignity of the many, many people who are working hard for low wages in this country – many more than there should be. And it is a much-needed tonic for the broken wage-setting process we have endured for so many years in this country.” \n“It also shows what this new Government can achieve in coalition and the value New Zealand First brings to the partnership. There are plenty of things to be done and this is a great start”. \nENDS",

      "text": "Power bills set to soar almost $2000 over next decade 24th Oct 2017 7:25 AM Use this content by The Australian \nHOUSEHOLD power bills would soar almost $200 per year for a decade under federal Labor's plan for a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. \nThat's according to modelling commissioned by the Climate Change Authority, which also showed almost all of Australia's 16 coal-fired power stations would have to close to meet the party's target. \nIt's the first indication of the costs of federal Labor's energy policy, and comes as the Turnbull Government urges state premiers to support its recently announced National Energy Guarantee. \nThe Australian reports the CCA modelling showed household energy bills would increase by $1921 over 10 years from 2020 to 2030 if an emissions intensity scheme was introduced that aimed to achieve a 52 per cent renewable energy target. \nThat's the closest model to Labor's target yet. The power station in Mannering Park will be the next to come offline after Liddell. Once it closes, the land will be used for a $30m solar farm. Picture: AAP \nIt showed the annual rise in electricity bills would start at about $100 a year in 2020 and peak at $285 a year in 2027. \nThe modelling, which was initially provided to the government in a briefing note on the Climate Change Authority's 2016 report on Policy Options for Australia's Electricity Supply Sector, also showed Australia would need to cut about 17,000 megawatts of black and brown coal-fired power generation out of the market by 2030. \nAccording to The Australian that would mean closing all but one or two of Australia's coal-fired power plants. \nEnergy Minister Josh Frydenberg told the publication the CCA modelling exposed Labor's \"hypocrisy\" over energy policy. All but one or two of Australia’s coal-fired power stations would be closed in favour of renewable energy sources under the plan. Picture: Tom Huntley \nHe accused the party, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. \n\"The only reason why Labor hasn't modelled its emission intensity scheme is because it will drive up household bills by an average of almost $200 per year,\" Mr Frydenberg told The Australian. \n\"That's more than a $300-a-year difference to the Turnbull government's National Energy Guarantee, which will deliver affordable and reliable power. \n\"A family in Newcastle who are already paying $1500 a year for their power cannot afford a $200 increase in their bill. Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg has accused Labor, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. Picture Kym Smith \n\"Labor has been calling for a bipartisan national policy based on expert advice. \n\"Now this is on the table this is a test of Bill Shorten's mettle. \n\"This is his chance to put aside the climate wars of the past.\" \nModelling for the Coalition's NEG shows it would likely cut average household power bills by up to $115 per year over a decade to 2030. \nThe federal government will put its NEG plan before state premiers at a Coalition of Australian Governments meeting next month. \nPremiers must sign off on the plan for it to go ahead. \nAhead of the meeting, Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott yesterday sent letters to the premiers urging them to support the plan.

      "text": "'My economic vision for Malaysia' - PM Najib Media Statement | October 24, 2017 13:49 MYT This, is the economic vision of PM Najib. - Filepic 1. AS we approach Budget 2018, I would like to share some thoughts about the challenges Malaysia has faced over the last few years and how I have tried to steer our country towards a prosperous, sustainable and inclusive future for all. 2. I want to explain my thinking ahead of the Budget on Friday and the plans we will announce then which, as always, will be for the benefit of all Malaysians. 3. My entry into the world of politics was abrupt and unplanned. It was prompted by the sudden death of my father, Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, when I was 23. 4. I had idolised him for his achievements and for his relentless dedication to see our nation and our people progress. Since then, my goal in life has always been to do my best to follow in his footsteps and serve the country. 5. Like my father, I too want to put Malaysia in the global stage; to be among the top 20 nations in the world by 2050. No accomplishment can ever be greater than putting Malaysia on the best track for its future. That is my vision for our Transformasi Nasional 2050 (TN50) initiative. 6. And we have certainly made huge progress. This is why the World Bank endorsed what this Government has been doing, and why it concluded in its last country report: “The Malaysian economy is progressing from a position of strength.” 7. Yet when I became Prime Minister in 2009, the economic challenges we faced were enormous. When I took office that April we were right in the middle of the great global recession, the worst since the 1930s. Being an open economy and dependent on international trade, Malaysia was severely affected. Our exports dropped 20% while our economy contracted sharply by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2009. 8. There were serious structural and legacy issues that had led to low wages which did not catch up to inflation, expensive cars, high poverty rates, income inequality, frequent highway toll-rate hikes, declining education standards, poor public transpiration, lop-sided Independent Power Plant (IPP) agreements, and rampant crony capitalism. All of this combined was damaging the people’s welfare. 9. We were also over-dependent on oil and gas and commodities, and development in the country was unequal, with Sabah, Sarawak and the Peninsular east coast states lagging behind. The situation required decisive action and clear direction. 10. So, first of all we immediately implemented two big economic stimulus packages worth RM67 billion to pump money into our economy, to revive it and save it from an even deeper contraction. 11. Through this decisive action we saved the Malaysian people from the pains of going through a deep recession, such as happened in 1997. Then, the KL Stock Exchange plunged by more than 50 percent, thousands lost their jobs, businesses went bankrupt, and there was real and widespread suffering. 12. The Global Recession of 2008-2009 was devastating to many countries, including advanced nations that have still not recovered today. Because we were swift to act, however, Malaysians were relatively shielded from its impact. It was nothing like 1997. 13. The stimulus packages did lead to a 10% jump in our Debt-to-GDP ratio to above the 50% level. But the measures worked and Malaysia recovered quickly. By the year's end, our economy started growing again. This was a remarkable turnaround. 14. That ratio has stabilised at below 55%, which is well below the level of most developed nations – the UK’s last year was nearly 90%, for instance. The opposition, however, tries to use this increase in debt to mislead Malaysians and claim we are going bankrupt. This is ridiculous. In 1986, Malaysia’s Debt-to-GDP ratio reached 103%, and we didn’t go bankrupt then! This shows that when they speak about the economy, the opposition mostly just spread propaganda and blatant lies for their selfish political interest. This has a name – economic sabotage. 15. Secondly, we knew that we had to undertake wholescale reform. We knew that to escape the middle-income trap and achieve our goal of becoming a high income status nation, we had to have an overarching, prudent economic plan – a roadmap, with key performance indicators and measurable outcomes so that we could test our progress and make sure we were keeping on track. 16. That plan was the National Transformation Programme, with its key component, the Economic Transformation Programme, or ETP. Some people have called that “Najibnomics”– I didn’t come up with the name! But I don’t mind people using the term, as seven years on we can see that the plan – which has the good of the Malaysian people at its heart and is its overriding aim – has delivered, and continues to deliver. 17. Gross National Income has increased by nearly 50%. We have narrowed the gap towards the high income target from 33% to19%. 18. 2.26 million jobs have been created, of which more than one million are high income jobs. 19. This March, our exports reached RM82.63 billion – the highest monthly figure for Malaysian exports ever recorded. 20. Inflation and unemployment have been kept low. Due to a policy of engagement abroad, we have attracted unprecedented levels of Foreign Direct Investment, which shows the confidence the world has in Malaysia. 21. In 2017 alone we have seen 14 business MOUs between Malaysia and China worth RM144 billion, 31 business MOUs between Malaysia and India worth RM158.4 billion, as well as a USD7 billion investment in Malaysia by Saudi Aramco. These will bring thousands of new jobs, transfers of skills, and improved standards of living for countless families. 22. And over that time, despite the huge turmoil in the global economy, the oil shock, and the disastrous recessions that hit much of Europe, almost destroying some counties, we registered year upon year of healthy growth. The World Bank recently revised their prediction for Malaysia’s growth to 5.2% for 2017 – the second time they have done so this year! 23. Those are some of the major milestones the Government and millions of hardworking Malaysians have marked under the plan we put in place in 2010. 24. But there are many, many other more specific moves the Government has taken to improve standards and help the people. 25. We introduced education blueprints for our schools and universities; and now we are seeing our universities starting to move up the international rankings steadily' 26. We are a nation of road users, which is why we encouraged Khazanah Nasional and EPF to buy PLUS Expressway outright in 2010 from the private holders. This means that every Ringgit collected now goes back either to the Government or to EPF account holders. 27. PLUS-owned highways such as the Penang Bridge, the Second Link and the North-South Expressway have also not seen any increase in toll rates since the buyout in 2010. 28. At the same time the roads have been upgraded – for example, large sections of the North-South Expressway have been expanded to three or four lanes compared to two lanes in the past. 29. Other aspects of public transportation had, however, been severely neglected by one of my predecessors. He wasted billions on vanity projects instead of building the world class infrastructure that Malaysia needs, both to attract investors and to serve the people. 30. Under my Government the first phase of the Mass Rapid Transit project was completed at the end of last year, and the second phase of the Sungai Buloh-Kajang MRT Line was launched in July. We now have 51 kilometres of operational line with 31 stations. 31. These projects created 130,000 new jobs, of which 70,000 are direct employment. And best of all, they were completed ahead of schedule and RM2 billion below budget. We are now planning for MRT 2 and 3, while in a few years’ time we will also have the first high-speed rail link connecting Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, which will cut travel time between the two cities to 90 minutes, as compared to more than four hours by car. 32. But it’s not just about the Klang Valley or the west coast. Far from it. Our focus has been on other parts of Malaysia that had been neglected for far too long – because we wanted our development to be fairer, more inclusive, and to raise all sectors of the population and parts of our country. 33. Kelantan, for instance, had been deliberately starved of development funds and deprived of critically-needed upgrades to their water infrastructure for decades by a former leader, just because it was held by an opposition party. 34. To me, this is not fair, as clean water is essential for life and is the right of all Malaysians. Therefore, we helped Kelantan with a water restructuring agreement last year that will cost more than a billion ringgit. 35. The people in Kelantan had also suffered from poor transportation links – resulting in many people having to endure slow, congested and dangerous car journeys when traveling between states. 36. To address this, our Government is building the toll-free Central Spine Road to connect Kelantan with the rest of the peninsula, while phase 3 of the East Coast Expressway will soon extend to Kelantan. 37. The East Coast Rail Link will soon be yet another game-changer for the east coast states. 38. When it comes to Sabah and Sarawak, never has any Federal Government provided as much in the way of yearly allocations and development projects for them – unlike in the past. The Pan Borneo Highway, to take one example, will be a huge spur for development and connectivity in East Malaysia. 39. I strive to be fair to all states – including the opposition-held states. For example, the Government has entered into a water restructuring agreement with Penang and Selangor to help them reduce their state debts and provide much needed revamps of their water supply infrastructure. 40. In the case of Penang, the water restructuring package in 2010 involved helping the state government reduce its debt by RM655 million, while giving them an additional grant of RM1.2 billion to expand a dam. This allowed the DAP State Government to boast that they had reduced their state debt by 95%, although this was in fact due to the Federal Government’s efforts. 41. Our efforts to make sure all Malaysians benefit from a rising economy have helped us register a stunning reduction in our poverty rate. Hard core poverty in Malaysia dropped from 3.8% in 2009 to just 0.4% in 2016. In Sabah alone, we had managed to reduce the rate from 19.7% in 2009 to just 2.9% last year. 42. The people’s income per capita has also increased from RM27,819 in 2010 to RM40,713 in 2017. Our monthly median income has increased from RM4,585 in 2014 to RM5,288 in 2016. And we have also seen an improvement in B40 household income – which has grown to RM3,000 in 2016 from RM2,629 in 2014. 43. As a result, our GINI ratio – which measures income equality – dropped from 0.441 in 2009 to 0.399 last year, the lowest in Malaysia's history. Malaysia’s income equality has never been better. 44. At the same time, we know that cost of living issues hit those on low incomes the hardest, and this is why we distributed RM5.36 billion in 1Malaysia People’s Aid, or BR1M, to 7.28 million households in 2016, and we introduced the minimum wage. 45. A former leader recently described BR1M as an abuse of government funds – but he should try telling that to the recipients. It is frankly cruel-hearted for anyone in the opposition to talk of taking away a programme that is designed to help ease the burden of millions. 46. Everything we have done has been for the good of the people. And that includes taking many tough but necessary decisions that were not always popular. 47. We needed to rationalise subsidies that were insufficiently targeted. They were blanket subsidies on various goods, such as petrol, which had started during a former leader’s time and had ballooned to unsustainable proportions. By 2012, for instance, fuel subsidies alone had reached RM25 billion and accounted for 13.6% of the total national Budget. 48. Many of the people who benefited were well-off, rather than the money being spent on those who needed it most. So what we did instead is channel funds to the Bottom 40 in a targetted manner, which we believe is a more prudent and ethical way to distribute public money. 49. We needed to reduce our reliance on revenue from oil and gas, which contributed 41% of Government income in 2009. This left us exposed and overly dependent on a non-renewable resource whose long-term future is in doubt as countries and industries turn to green energy solutions. 50. We were successful in this, and oil and gas supply only 14.6% of Government revenues in 2017. This early decision was fortunate as the crash in global oil prices in 2014 showed. 51. The last time that global prices for Malaysia's major commodity exports crashed was in 1985. Back then we were unprepared, and our economy quickly entered a deep recession. 52. This time, however, we were prepared, due to the Government’s insistence on ensuring the resilience of our economic fundamentals. Although we were still affected by the global oil price crash in 2014, unlike many similar petroleum exporting countries, Malaysia not only managed to avoid recession but our economy continued to grow. 53. One of the measures that was crucial to this was the Goods and Services Tax, or GST – the source of one of the opposition’s main attack on the government. 54. Many have falsely alleged that GST is an entirely new tax, put in place just for the purpose of bringing in more revenue for the Government. In fact, it was a replacement for the sales and service taxes, which were inefficient, complicated and not working well for either consumers or businesses. 55. If raising revenue was our only intention, it would have been easier to raise existing corporate, income and the sales and service taxes. But doing that would have been bad for local businesses, and off-putting to international investors. 56. In fact, since I became Finance Minister in 2008, we have reduced corporate taxes from 27% to 24%. Personal income tax rates have also fallen, from 28% in 2008 to 24% now for the majority of Malaysians. 57. We also raised the tax threshold so that those whose income is RM4,000 or below no longer have to pay any income tax – unlike in the past, where those who had salaries of even RM2,000 were taxed. These are all incentives for individuals and businesses to excel, as they keep a significantly higher percentage of the fruits of their labour. 58. So, GST should not be considered an additional new tax but part of a comprehensive tax reform that is designed to make Malaysia more competitive, to control the black and illegal economy, to reduce tax evasion and broaden the overall tax base. 59. Since Malaysia implemented our GST in 2015, many other countries, such as India and Egypt, have followed suit, while all the Gulf Cooperation Countries – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – will implement their GST on January 1 next year. 60. And our economic plan has led to Malaysia’s GST rate only needing to be 6% – far lower than other countries who don’t share our strong economic fundamentals. 61. The vast majority of countries – over 160 around the world – have implemented a GST because they know they need it to make their countries stronger and more competitive. Strangely, the opposition claims not to understand this. They want to abolish it – but with no suggestion about how they would make up the RM41 billion GST raised last year. 62. I also want to be very clear that the claim that GST was necessary to pay for 1MDB is an absolute lie – as the politicians making this false claim know very well. 63. 1MDB in fact played a key role in solving the lop-sided power agreements signed by a former leader. When 1MDB entered the industry, it was the lowest bidder in all its agreements, thus saving Malaysia RM200 billion over the next 20 years. One research house's report about the revised power agreements was simply titled \"No more sweetheart deals\". 64. 1MDB has also funded the construction and upgrades of eight military bases which past governments were unable to do. It has also funded thousands of scholarships and Hajj trips for pilgrims. 65. Now it is true that 1MDB has had its share of problems, and we long ago revamped the management to correct the mistakes and bring it back to financial health. 66. But when the Bandar Malaysia project agreement is signed, you can expect 1MDB to make a decent profit that will more than recover its losses. And the lie that the people have had to pay for 1MDB’s decisions will be nailed once and for all, as after the rationalisation programme is completed it is very likely that 1MDB will have made a profit for the people – not to mention all the corporate social responsibility work it has done over the years. 67. Lastly, I want to address issues around our currency, the Ringgit. When the US suffered from the effects of the Great Recession in 2008-2009, they started reducing interest rates – which led to global funds moving their funds into countries such as Malaysia in search of a higher return. 68. Our Ringgit benefited from this and appreciated 30% from RM3.73 to the US dollar when I first became Prime Minister to below RM3.00 in 2011-2013. However, when the US started to recover from their recession, they started raising interest rates again. 69. This, coupled with the drastic drop in commodity prices, caused our Ringgit to weaken to its current value – which is now another topic that the opposition uses to criticise the government. 70. It is strange that the opposition is now claiming that the current weaker Ringgit is a sign that Malaysia is going bankrupt – when in GE13, the opposition also alleged that Malaysia was going bankrupt despite the Ringgit having appreciated 30% against the US dollar! 71. Pegging the Ringgit and re-imposing capital controls would have been the easiest thing for me to do. Having suffered from a lack of investment after we had imposed capital controls and pegged our Ringgit from 1998 to 2005, however, we decided not to do it again. 72. It is true that the Ringgit weakened amidst the global turmoil and uncertainties since 2014, but there have been positive aspects to that, as our exports and tourism boomed. 73. And while some have painted it as weak, our Ringgit actually performed better than the currencies of many other large commodity exporter countries. As our economy continues to perform well – as all forecasters predict it will – our Ringgit will regain its strength and an appropriate market rate. 74. You won’t hear about all this from the opposition or a former leader. A former leader who is obsessed by power and wanted to continue ruling long into his retirement, and who blamed me for his son’s loss in the race to be UMNO’s vice-president in 2013. 75. I had refused to conform to his ways as I firmly believed that Malaysia needed a new vision, away from the old ways that had led to the serious legacy problems that we had faced before and which were damaging the people’s welfare. 76. As a country, we must move on to the next phase to be a developed high-income country where the standard of living and the quality of life for Malaysians is the top priority. This is my vision for Malaysia – a cause that is much bigger than myself. Malaysia has always punched above our weight, and I believe in our tremendous potential as a country. 77. That potential has been recognised by many international institutions such as the OECD, the IMF and the World Bank. They have repeatedly praised the Government’s macroeconomic management and structural reforms, while a survey co-authored by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania earlier this year declared Malaysia to be the ‘Best Country to Invest In’. 78. All the major credit ratings agencies have reaffirmed Malaysia’s status within the “A” band, and the verdict of the OECD was that: “Malaysia is one of the most successful Southeast Asian economies… thanks to sound macroeconomic fundamentals and its success in transforming its economy into a well-diversified and inclusive one.” 79. These are the results of the economic plan this Government put into place after I took office in 2009. The tough decisions we took were not always popular – but they were necessary, and they have spared Malaysia from the ravages of recession and the turbulence that has afflicted the global economy. We have acted as a responsible Government, always seeking to protect our people and look after their welfare and security. 80. In a few days, I will be presenting Budget 2018 where new initiatives and several major announcements will be revealed to benefit all Malaysians. 81. This Budget will continue to be guided by my goal to correct the problems of the past and to make Malaysia stronger, more competitive at home and abroad; to create a Malaysia that protects the vulnerable and is fair to all: a Malaysia where none of our brothers and sisters are left behind.",

It makes commercial sense for the government to complete it to maximise its return on the investment across the Pacific Highway.\" \n\"Labor is whinging not enough is happening on the Pacific Highway, but North Coast residents can see the pace of the work north of Woolgoolga in the Page and Cowper electorates.\" \nInfrastructure and Transport Minister Darren Chester also issued a statement on the claims from Labor today. \n\"Luke Hartsuyker regularly informs me of the community interest in the Coffs Harbour Bypass and I look forward to receiving the completed business case from the NSW Government,\" Mr Chester said. \nDiscussions on the Coffs Harbour Bypass came as the NSW Government today opened the new section of highway to traffic between Corindi Beach and Halfway Creek. \n\n\nEARLIER: THERE have been no formal discussions concerning funding for the Coffs Harbour Pacific Highway bypass between the Federal and State Coalition Governments, it has been claimed by the Opposition today. \nLabor's spokesman for Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development Anthony Albanese said Senate Budget Estimates Committee hearings in Canberra late yesterday heard that there was no chance that the project would commence any time before 2020, if at all. \n\"In further proof that the Federal MP for Cowper, Luke Hartsuyker, has no clout within the Turnbull Government, the committee heard no detailing planning had been undertaken and that the New South Wales Government was only now beginning to turn its mind to the preparation of a business case for Commonwealth consideration,\" Mr Albanese told The Advocate this morning. \nOfficials from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development said when the NSW Government produced a business case, the Government \"might consider\"' a funding contribution. \nBut nothing would happen until the completion of the ongoing duplication of the Pacific Highway to the Queensland border, which is scheduled for 2020. \nThe committee also heard the department had no idea how much the bypass would cost.

Picture: AAP The earliest the by-election could be held is December 2, which will leave the Coalition without its one-seat majority for at least one sitting week.\nChief Justice Susan Kiefel had acknowledged there was public interest in making a ruling as soon as possible at the close of a three-day High Court hearing in Canberra earlier this month.\nThe High Court will also rule on the dual citizenship cases of Nationals senators Matt Canavan and Fiona Nash, Greens senators Scott Ludlum and Larissa Waters, independent Nick Xenophon and One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts on Friday.\nmedia_camera The “citizenship seven” will know their fate on Friday. Picture: AAP Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue argued the government’s case that only Senator Roberts and Mr Ludlum should be disqualified from Parliament during the three-day hearing.\nThe saga was sparked in July by Mr Ludlum’s resignation for holding New Zealand citizenship.\nHe was quickly followed by Ms Waters, who revealed she also held Canadian citizenship.\nSenator Canavan was then the first high profile government member to announce he might also have questions over his citizenship status.\nHe stepped aside from Mr Turnbull’s frontbench while the High Court decided the case.\nMr Joyce then made the bombshell announcement that he might be a New Zealand citizen in August, sparking intense scrutiny of dozens of other MPs who could be dual citizens.\nSenators Roberts, Nash and Xenophon were then referred to the High Court as well.\nOriginally published as Citizenship chaos not over yet",

Australia appointed their first ever rural health commissioner, Professor Paul Worley, at the weekend. This is a milestone event, an election promise on which they delivered. The commissioner will provide independent advice to government on rural health for the betterment of Australia. \n“We are eager to set up an urgent meeting with government about introducing a similar role in New Zealand to help them deliver on their promise of improving access to health services for rural New Zealanders. \n“The government needs to help remove barriers so rural people’s health is considered just as important as those who live in cities,” she says. \nThere are more than 600,000 people living in rural New Zealand, equivalent of easily being the country’s second largest city. Agriculture and tourism are the powerhouses of the Kiwi economy. \nEvery year, more than two and a half million tourists visit rural New Zealand. In 2011-2012, $53 billion, or 25 percent of GDP, was generated directly or indirectly by the agri-food sector, from rural New Zealand. \nFor more information contact Make Lemonade editor-in-chief Kip Brook on 0275 030188. \nPhoto : RHAANZ chief executive Michelle Thompson 0",

      "text": "Image sourced from Shutterstock.com \nBy David Hargreaves \nOne consequence of the unexpected change in Government is that we may start to see some sorting out between the property investors and the speculators. \nThere's an arguably fairly thin line between the two anyway (although I'm sure many of interest.co's commenters would disagree) and with the kind of ever-rising market seen in recent years, particularly in Auckland then investors have become speculators and speculators investors. \nTill we know more exactly about the shape of policy under this Government then any comment about what it will do and the likely impact is, well, speculation. \nNo one likes uncertainty \nWhat can be said with reasonable certainty is that no market likes uncertainty. \nSo, with the housing market having gone into 'wait and see' mode prior to the election, it's not likely to switch out of that mode till we see the whites of this Government's eyes, policy-wise. \nWhat could be reasonably expected till people know better then is a continuation of low housing sales activity and flat prices. And that could be for several months. There will be no pre-Christmas boom in the way there was in 2014 after the National-led Government status quo was preserved. \nSo, quiet till and beyond Christmas and with greater signs of what exactly the Government policy mix will be in the early months of next year, with the housing market presumably reacting accordingly then. \nGovernment moves \nIf the new Government is to be taken as read with the pre-election indications of policy (and some tentative post-election indications) then the intention will be there to ramp up house building, immigration will be curbed and non-resident offshore buyers won't be allowed to buy existing stock. \nThere's plenty of room for discussion on how effective any or all of those policies will be, should they be implemented. I'll come back to that. \nWhat the very presence of those policies does though is add a definite drag factor to a market already being slowed by reduced foreign buying activity, the 40% deposit limits for investors and a move to more cautionary lending policies by the banks. \nAll this will at the very least cause pause for thought for housing investors, particularly the more recent ones. \nKnowing the sums \nOnly somebody who has bought an investment property truly knows their sums (although presumably the folks who lent them money know too). But anybody who has bought a low rental-yielding property thinking: \"Don't worry about the rental yield it will be worth thousands more in a year,\" will now be having a few thoughts about what they want to do. \nThe good news in all this is that interest rates are still at incredibly low levels and there's no imminent sign of them going higher. \nIf interest rates were rising right now, then the portents for the housing market would not be good at all. \nA rising interest rate environment would produce what you could call 'push-pull' dynamics. On the one hand the borrower is paying more on their mortgage interest rates - which they may or may not be able to recoup from higher rents, and on the other hand rising interest rates make fixed interest deposit investments relatively more attractive alongside property investment - particularly if the rental yields are lousy.

But if those interest rates do start to move up, well then the pressure might go on. \nThe Reserve Bank will need to be watchful. \nAn early priority \nA very early priority for this Government I think must be getting a new Governor appointed to take over when Acting Governor Grant Spencer leaves in March (or maybe even before if possible - though that's probably unlikely). Then there is the sorting out of the Policy Targets Agreement and whether the focus of monetary policy will be broadened out beyond just inflation. \nIt will be important to have both those things in place as quickly as possible because we need to know whether the outlook for official interest rates via the Official Cash Rate will be different. \nThen the other thing a new Governor will have to give serious and early consideration to is macro-prudential tools and particularly the LVR rules and whether the current regime with the 40% deposit rule for investors and the general 10% 'speed limit' on owner occupiers borrowing more than 80% will be retained. \nGiven the new wave of uncertainty the change of Government puts into the housing market I really do think possibly removing at the very least the 40% deposit rule for investors needs looking at. \nThere are risks \nThe risk of course is that if enough investors (or speculators, if you will) feel sufficiently pressured to put their properties on the market then this could cause the sharp fall in the market and therefore the consequences for the banks and the financial system that the RBNZ has actually sought to avoid with the LVRs. Yes, that's right the 'cure' could end up being the cause in the wrong circumstances. \nI think the coming months will be a test of nerve for some 'investors' and arguably will be a time in which we find out whether reasonable numbers of people have been more risky than they should have been in buying properties in expectation of capital gains but which don't stack up as investments in the conventional property investment sense - IE the rental yields are not strong enough versus the outgoings on the property. \nPerception is likely to be a big factor than reality in the next couple of years because it remains questionable how much impact any new Government policies now will have. \nAny curbs on migration will take time to produce a significant flowing in the inbound migration rate (though it is now starting to slow in any case). \nBuilding the houses will be a stretch \nBuilding 10,000 houses a year is going to be a stretch because the capacity constraints that are already visible in the market are going to be an obstacle regardless of whether the Government itself is literally trying to build the houses or as with the previous Government was largely (till it realised it wasn't working) trying to get the 'market' itself to do it. \nAnd I still think the ban on foreign buyers is going to be much harder than Labour has been trying to say it will be. My bet is that if this Government lasts a full year term (and that's not a given) there will be no ban in place at the end of the term. \nSo, as I say, many of the obstacles for the housing market at the moment are in the mind rather than 'real' obstacles. But the mind's a powerful thing. And there will be some nervous 'investors' out there. What they end up doing will be very important for the economy over the next year. \nWe welcome your help to improve our coverage of this issue. Any examples or experiences to relate?

      "text": "Power bills set to soar almost $2000 over next decade 24th Oct 2017 7:25 AM Use this content by The Australian \nHOUSEHOLD power bills would soar almost $200 per year for a decade under federal Labor's plan for a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. \nThat's according to modelling commissioned by the Climate Change Authority, which also showed almost all of Australia's 16 coal-fired power stations would have to close to meet the party's target. \nIt's the first indication of the costs of federal Labor's energy policy, and comes as the Turnbull Government urges state premiers to support its recently announced National Energy Guarantee. \nThe Australian reports the CCA modelling showed household energy bills would increase by $1921 over 10 years from 2020 to 2030 if an emissions intensity scheme was introduced that aimed to achieve a 52 per cent renewable energy target. \nThat's the closest model to Labor's target yet. The power station in Mannering Park will be the next to come offline after Liddell. Once it closes, the land will be used for a $30m solar farm. Picture: AAP \nIt showed the annual rise in electricity bills would start at about $100 a year in 2020 and peak at $285 a year in 2027. \nThe modelling, which was initially provided to the government in a briefing note on the Climate Change Authority's 2016 report on Policy Options for Australia's Electricity Supply Sector, also showed Australia would need to cut about 17,000 megawatts of black and brown coal-fired power generation out of the market by 2030. \nAccording to The Australian that would mean closing all but one or two of Australia's coal-fired power plants. \nEnergy Minister Josh Frydenberg told the publication the CCA modelling exposed Labor's \"hypocrisy\" over energy policy. All but one or two of Australia’s coal-fired power stations would be closed in favour of renewable energy sources under the plan. Picture: Tom Huntley \nHe accused the party, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. \n\"The only reason why Labor hasn't modelled its emission intensity scheme is because it will drive up household bills by an average of almost $200 per year,\" Mr Frydenberg told The Australian. \n\"That's more than a $300-a-year difference to the Turnbull government's National Energy Guarantee, which will deliver affordable and reliable power. \n\"A family in Newcastle who are already paying $1500 a year for their power cannot afford a $200 increase in their bill. Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg has accused Labor, which has yet to release modelling of its energy policy, of deliberately trying to hide the cost. Picture Kym Smith \n\"Labor has been calling for a bipartisan national policy based on expert advice. \n\"Now this is on the table this is a test of Bill Shorten's mettle. \n\"This is his chance to put aside the climate wars of the past.\" \nModelling for the Coalition's NEG shows it would likely cut average household power bills by up to $115 per year over a decade to 2030. \nThe federal government will put its NEG plan before state premiers at a Coalition of Australian Governments meeting next month. \nPremiers must sign off on the plan for it to go ahead. \nAhead of the meeting, Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott yesterday sent letters to the premiers urging them to support the plan.

      "text": "Another Department breaks ranks to breach APS Guidelines Written on 24 October 2017 . \nIn Senate Estimates today, it’s been revealed that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources is implementing new union access rules in defiance of the APS Bargaining Policy. \nThe Department of Agriculture and Water Resources’ new Consultation and Representation Protocol , which can only be varied with the agreement of the CPSU, will allow CPSU material to be spammed to all employees, and have new workers subjected to a 45 minute union presentation encouraging new staff to join the union. \nThis follows the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet implementing similar policies without the approval of the Prime Minister, the Public Service Minister nor the APS Commissioner. \n“Why on earth these departments feel it’s appropriate to dramatically expand union workplace access in defiance of the APS Bargaining Policy and without so much as a conversation with the Government is beyond me,” Senator Abetz said. \n“These draconian policies are clearly designed to try and increase CPSU membership at a time when union membership is on the decline and flies in the face of the principle of freedom of association.” \n“I look forward to the Department providing full responses to my questions and hope the Department will work to ditch this unnecessary impost on workers,” Senator Abetz concluded. About Eric \nEric Abetz has been a Liberal Senator for Tasmania since 1994 and has served in a range of Leadership, Ministerial and Shadow Ministerial roles.",

SHARE Canberra horse Maryore is set to run on Melbourne Cup day. Photo: bradleyphotos.com.au \nIt will strengthen the capital's contingent at the marquee event of the spring carnival, with the 2017 provincial championship winner likely to join Nick Olive-trained Single Gaze on Australia's biggest horse racing stage. \nSingle Gaze will end Canberra's 12-year drought without a horse in the Melbourne Cup when she runs in the race that stops a nation on November 7. Related Articles \nIble and Maryore will also be there and the 27-year-old trainer says he's already starting to feel the nerves building a year after shifting his base to Canberra. \n\"You always dream of racing on these sorts of days,\" Ible said.

The nerves are already there to be honest. But it's going to be a great day.\" \nMaryore was part of Philip Courtney's stable until recently relocating to join Ible's growing group of horses. \nIble has been training for the past five years after starting in Moruya and moving to Canberra 18 months ago. He has 16 horses in work and is hoping that number swells next year. \nMaryore could be the trigger for that with the six-year-old chasing her seventh win and her first since joining Ible. \nIble will take Maryore to Sydney next week for a trial and to work with jockey Tim Clark, who will jump on board on Melbourne Cup day. \n\"I wanted to grow the business and quality of horses. I'd like to get to 25 horses in the next 12 months and a winner on Melbourne Cup day would definitely help,\" Ible said. \n\"It has always been my attention to give [Maryore] just one or two races in the spring before setting her for an autumn campaign. She looks tremendous and has come back stronger.\" \nSingle Gaze finished second in the Caulfield Cup last weekend and will become the first Canberra horse since 2005 to race in the Melbourne Cup. \n\"It's an exciting time. Every stable out at Canberra jumps on board for these big races ... it just adds excitement to everything being done,\" Ible said.",

Port Adelaide's ambitious play to the Asian nation will continue when it once again faces the Gold Coast Suns in Shanghai. The ground has been christened as Adelaide Arena at Jiangwan Stadium, with the match to be played in Round 9 on the afternoon of Saturday, May 19. This season, the Power thumped the Suns by 72 points in front of 10,118 fans in Shanghai. The Power want to increase ticketing for 2018's match to 13,000. Both teams were given an early bye after the fixture to compensate for the long-distance travel. Gold Coast has been forced to relocate several of its home games due to the 2018 Commonwealth Games being held in the city. The Suns will not be able to play at Metricon Stadium until early June, but will play seven home games there after their return. Gold Coast will face North Melbourne at Cairns' Cazalys Stadium in Round 1.

      "text": "WIN a Beautiful Designer Beach Shade from Hollie and Harrie \nHollie and Harrie is AUSTRALIA’S PREMIER AND ORIGINAL DESIGNER BEACH SHADE /SOMBRILLA \nLong time friends and founders, Skye Hollingsworth (Hollie) & Claire Harris (Harrie) from Melbourne Australia are joined together by a love of the sunny outdoors and family life. \nWe adore the beach and outdoors but dread the sunburn. We are very ‘sun smart’ but find the existing beach tents on the market too stifling, provide no natural air flow and our children do not enjoy sitting in them. \nAnd so we designed the Sombrilla as our first product. Stylish and extremely practical, children love playing (and adults love to relax!) under the shade provided by the Sombrilla and 95% UV protection will give you added peace of mind. OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA \nSince release of the Sombrilla sales both locally in Australia and internationally (USA, Europe and New Zealand) have increased each year with many sales to existing satisfied customers and the Sombrilla is now a common sight on many beaches around the world . \nIn Feb 2017 Hollie & Harrie was purchased by Australia’s largest importer and wholesaler of Beach Shade and Beach furniture –“The Beachkit Group” \nElegant & sophisticated, the Sombrilla is made from 100% cotton, so breathe & relax while enjoying superior sun protection. With optional configurations for high-sun and low-sun you’ll need to pack a picnic. You can now indulge in those long summer days at the beach blissfully unaware of the heat as you enjoy yourself under a cool canopy of natural shade. \nSince 2010 this is the Original and Best Australian Designer Beach Shade – our competitors have come and gone but they all initially buy our product to try and match our design and quality. \nRaw unbleached material, combined with silk screen printing gives each Sombrilla individual character. Slight variations in the print means you can be sure you have an original Hollie & Harrie beach shade. \nThanks to our friends at Hollie and Harrie we have 2 beautiful Sombrillas to GIVE AWAY to 2 of our lucky readers. If you or someone you know would love the chance to WIN one of these, simply enter your details below and good luck x",

Photo: JUDE KEOGH 1024jkfield2 \nIt’s more than tractors and tools at the Australian National Field Days – there’s almost everything for country residents and farmers. \nJohn Lulham, along with his wife Wendy and son Dave, run the Nick Nack Gallery and they’ve brought around 5000 hats made by Statesman, Barmah, Rigon and Jackeru. \nHis stock includes hats made from fur-felt or kangaroo leather and some approved by the Cancer Council. \nAfter 20 years of selling hats at the field days, Mr Lulham says a good hat is “one that fits”. \nMr Lulham said he travelled eastern Australia going from field days to the biggest regional agricultural shows. \nHe said some customers came back year after year, looking for a new hat which fit their children, “and often a new hat for themselves”. \nMr Lulham said Barmah’s kangaroo leather hats were the “Rolls-Royce” of the style – which were even rain shower-proof. \nMeanwhile, Statesmen hats started in 1835 in Brisbane, but the brand name was practically unknown despite supplying boarding schools and the Australian Defence Force. \nMr Lulham said while city dwellers had stopped wearing hats they remained an “essential accessory for country people”. \n“If you look at the movies and my grandfather, they all had fur-felt hats,” he said. \nThe Nick Nack Gallery will be located at site E4 during the Australian National Field Days from Thursday.",

AFMA requested a response and HMAS Armidale was tasked to apprehend the vessel. Soon after, a second foreign fishing vessel was spotted nearby. \nHMAS Armidale intercepted and boarded the first vessel and reported six fishers on board. The second vessel was subsequently intercepted and boarded with eight fishers on board the vessel. \nSmall catches and fishing equipment were located and recovered from the vessels, including hookah gear, sea snail, and dried and fresh fish. \nThe two vessels and 14 crew members arrived in Darwin today to face further investigation by AFMA over possible breaches of Australian fisheries laws. \nActing MBC Commander, Air Commodore Andrew Campbell said this apprehension of two vessels and 14 crew was testament to MBC’s significant aerial and surface surveillance capability. \n“Through close cooperation with our maritime security partners we are able to successfully detect and disrupt illegal fishing in Australian waters,” Air Commodore Campbell said. \n“Our officers will continue to safeguard Australia’s border and unique marine resources from those who seek to breach the AFZ.” \nAFMA’s General Manager Operations, Peter Venslovas, said that protecting Australia’s marine resources from illegal fishing activity is paramount to ensuring sustainability. \n“Together with MBC, AFMA continues working to stamp out illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in Australian waters to protect and preserve our fish resources to be sustainably used by current and future generations of Australians,” Mr Venslovas said. \n“Through regular surveillance and capacity building with our regional neighbours, we have seen the number of foreign IUU fishing vessels decrease in recent years.” Search",

Ible is set to enter Maryore in the group 3 Maybe Mahal Stakes (1400m) for mares at Flemington on Melbourne Cup day. Canberra horse Maryore is set to run on Melbourne Cup day. Photo: bradleyphotos.com.au It will strengthen the capital's contingent at the marquee event of the spring carnival, with the 2017 provincial championship winner likely to join Nick Olive-trained Single Gaze on Australia's biggest horse racing stage. Single Gaze will end Canberra's 12-year drought without a horse in the Melbourne Cup when she runs in the race that stops a nation on November 7. Ible and Maryore will also be there and the 27-year-old trainer says he's already starting to feel the nerves building a year after shifting his base to Canberra. Advertisement \"You always dream of racing on these sorts of days,\" Ible said. \"It's hard to say what her chances are without seeing the field yet, but she's getting towards that grade now. \"You dream of this sort of thing in your whole career so to be doing it now is exciting. The nerves are already there to be honest. But it's going to be a great day.\" Maryore was part of Philip Courtney's stable until recently relocating to join Ible's growing group of horses. Ible has been training for the past five years after starting in Moruya and moving to Canberra 18 months ago. He has 16 horses in work and is hoping that number swells next year. Maryore could be the trigger for that with the six-year-old chasing her seventh win and her first since joining Ible. Ible will take Maryore to Sydney next week for a trial and to work with jockey Tim Clark, who will jump on board on Melbourne Cup day. \"I wanted to grow the business and quality of horses. I'd like to get to 25 horses in the next 12 months and a winner on Melbourne Cup day would definitely help,\" Ible said. \"It has always been my attention to give [Maryore] just one or two races in the spring before setting her for an autumn campaign. She looks tremendous and has come back stronger.\" Loading Single Gaze finished second in the Caulfield Cup last weekend and will become the first Canberra horse since 2005 to race in the Melbourne Cup. \"It's an exciting time. Every stable out at Canberra jumps on board for these big races ... it just adds excitement to everything being done,\" Ible said.",

Port Adelaide's ambitious play to the Asian nation will continue when it once again faces the Gold Coast Suns in Shanghai. The ground has been christened as Adelaide Arena at Jiangwan Stadium, with the match to be played in Round 9 on the afternoon of Saturday, May 19. This season, the Power thumped the Suns by 72 points in front of 10,118 fans in Shanghai. The Power want to increase ticketing for 2018's match to 13,000. Both teams were given an early bye after the fixture to compensate for the long-distance travel. Gold Coast has been forced to relocate several of its home games due to the 2018 Commonwealth Games being held in the city. The Suns will not be able to play at Metricon Stadium until early June, but will play seven home games there after their return. Gold Coast will face North Melbourne at Cairns' Cazalys Stadium in Round 1. AFL 2018 FIXTURE - WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR * Port Adelaide v Gold Coast at Adelaide Arena at Jiangwan Stadium in Shanghai (Round 9, Saturday afternoon) * Gold Coast v North Melbourne at Cazalys Stadium (Round 1, Saturday night) * Round 1 will begin Thursday, March 22 * Full AFL 2018 fixture to be released Tuesday, October 31",

      "text": "Veteran spinner Brad Hogg has pushed for Melbourne Renegades teammate Matthew Wade to be dropped from the Australian Test team, urging the national selectors to back in the younger Alex Carey, provided the South Australian wicketkeeper performs in the early rounds of the Sheffield Shield.\nThe keeper spot in Australia's XI for the first Ashes Test is up for grabs, with incumbent Wade, 29, under pressure to hold his position. Carey, 26, and Peter Nevill, 32, who made way for Wade late last year, are viewed as two the most likely replacements for Wade if the selectors opt to make a change.\nSpeaking on SEN's The Run Home on Tuesday, Hogg – who has signed to play again for the Big Bash League's Renegades, despite approaching his 47th birthday – threw his support behind Carey, and to a lesser extent Nevill, who played with Hogg at the Renegades last summer, but has since moved to the Sydney Sixers.\n\"As far as I'm concerned, if Alex Carey from South Australia does a good job, gets runs on the board early on, I think they should go 'Alex, that's your spot for a number of years' because the keeper's the one that gives you the energy out in the middle,\" Hogg said.\n\"He's the one that can direct traffic, help the captain out, so if you can have a keeper that's stable, there for the long run, keeps the energy up, I think they should be looking at a keeper for the long-term, not the short-term.\n\"I'd love [Peter] Nevill to get back in there, I think he had a great year there last year.\n\"Whoever makes those runs early on should get in there. I think it's between Nevill and Carey at the moment.\n\" 'Wadey', he's had a little bit of a rough patch in the subcontinent. He'd like to have a run in Australian conditions as well.\"\nWade, Nevill and Carey are all set to stake their claims for a berth in the Brisbane Test XI when the Shield season begins later this week.",

      "text": "Are the Crows cursed by the No.6 jumper? premium_icon by Michelangelo Rucci \nCAN a sporting team be cursed? \nIn Boston, there was the baseball \"Curse of the Bambino\" with Babe Ruth's sale by the Red Sox to the New York Yankees. In Chicago, it was the Cubs - and the goat evicted from Wrigley Field during a World Series game. \nAnd now inaugural Crows coach Graham Cornes is wondering if - for the second time - the Adelaide Football Club is cursed ... or, at least, the No. 6 jumper is jinxed. \nThe first time, when Cornes was coach in the early 1990s, he felt the need to have an Aboriginal elder protect the Crows from extraordinary forces. It was the era in which Collingwood president Allan McAlister drew a curse on the Magpies in 1993 for his remarks about how Aboriginal people should behave after St Kilda hero Nicky Winmar stood up against racism. \nCollingwood went 18 years - and through four grand finals - before it won an AFL flag. \nNow Cornes is buying into the \"Modra curse\" at West Lakes. It has extraordinary similarities to the Ruth moment with the Red Sox in 1920. Former Crows star Tony Modra being carried off ground after playing his 150th AFL match for Fremantle. \nAt the end of the 1998 season, as the Crows were celebrating their second AFL flag, Modra was shipped to Fremantle after premiership coach Malcolm Blight had made the high-marking, goalkicking sensation clear his locker at West Lakes after a disastrous final against Melbourne at the MCG. \nSince then, Adelaide has lost four preliminary finals (2002, 2005, 2006 and 2012) and this year's grand final to Richmond. Cursed? \nBut more fascinating has been the storyline with the players who have inherited the No. 6 jumper made famous during Modra's 118-game, 440-goal career at Adelaide that delivered no premiership medal to the man they dubbed \"Godra\". \nModra missed the 1997 grand final with a knee injury suffered in the preliminary final win against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. He was cast away from the club for the last three finals of 1998. \nAnd since then the No. 6 jumper has been worn by James Byrne, Ben Nelson, Fergus Watts, Jonathon Griffin, Jack Gunston, Luke Thompson and Jake Lever. \nNone of these players can say they added to the fame of the No. 6 guernsey. None reached his 100-game milestone in No. 6 at Adelaide. Gunston, who has become a premiership hero at Hawthorn, and Lever, who has defected to Melbourne, had the promise ... but did not stay to fulfil the optimism at West Lakes. \nThompson would have felt cursed when he blew a chance to win for the Crows the last Showdown at Football Park in 2013. His errant shot at goal - while ignoring an unmarked Patrick Dangerfield at the top of the southern goalsquare - is as infamous as the Angus Monfries' off-break goal that won the derby for Port Adelaide. \nSo Cornes is now starting to wonder if there a \"Curse of the Bambino\" created by Modra's exile to Fremantle. Modra has returned to Adelaide, just as Ruth did to Boston after 21 years of unrivalled success with the Yankees. \nBut the curse took 86 years to clear from the Red Sox. \nThe Adelaide Football Club would hope Cornes has not hit on a jinx. Baseball star Babe Ruth for New York in 1932.",

      "text": "Footy star turns booze business into $200m giant Tyson Otto, news.com.au October 24, 2017 4:22pm \nJOEL Macdonald has been a busy man since retiring from footy four years ago. \nWhile his two former clubs — Melbourne and Brisbane — still haven’t got it right since his retirement, Macdonald has used those four years to become the most unlikely $100 million star in Australian football. \nMacdonald will on Friday be announced as a new inductee into the Australian Financial Review’s young rich list on the back of his stake in his exploding software company GetSwift. \nHe has been on one helluva ride since hanging up his footy boots. \nThe Australian Financial Review estimates Macdonald’s personal fortune to be worth more than $100 million — it would have been enough to place him as the No. 22 richest young person in Australia, according to the 2016 BRW Young Rich list . \nThe report values Macdonald’s wealth at $36 million, but GetSwift’s sharp rise has seen his estimated personal wealth sky-rocket in the past few months alone to the $100 million-mark. \nHe’s come a long way since delivering alcohol to Saturday night party-goers on the back of a scooter. \nHe was trying to get his booze-delivery business LiquorRun up and running during his final season with the Demons in 2013. \nAs the business started to boom, Macdonald and his teammate-investors, Rohan Bail and James Strauss, spearheaded a project to deliver real-time delivery tracking software specific to their unique business needs. \nIt has ended up being a $200m idea. \n“We built it to scratch our own itch,” Macdonald told 3AW Mornings with Neil Mitchell . media_camera You won’t forget about Joel Macdonald now. \n“We had our own liquour company and a lot of people needed alcohol on a Saturday night and surprise, surprise it got really popular and we needed a solution to really streamline and optimise that whole scenario. \n“It just so happens that a couple of big companies in America took more of an interest in our software than our logistics company and before we knew it we had a completely different business and the global demand was just incredible.” \nHis company plans to allow any company in the world to follow in the footsteps of Uber’s driver tracking platform or Domino’s pizza delivery system. \nEarlier this year the company signed a deal worth more than $100 million with a car-parts delivery network in North America. \n11 months after being listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, the company’s software is being used in 650 cities around the globe — Uber is used in 680 cities globally, according to Macdonald. \nSince its stock was floated on the ASX at 20 cents in December, last year, it has jumped more than 740 per cent. \nFor GetSwift, the times are good. \nThe 33-year-old says his incredible success in business is in part due to his football education. \nHe says his learning experience under coach Leigh Matthews while playing with the Brisbane Lions during the club’s historic premiership three-peat from 2001-03 has been transferred over to the culture he has established at GetSwift. \n“Especially being at Brisbane when they won three premierships in a row, you learn a lot about building an organisation, setting a really strong culture,” he said. \n“Culture is everything. That’s something we protect hard at GetSwift.” AFL draft: Who will go no.1? 1:19 \nAFL: Draft Preview discsussion on who will be the No.1 pick in the upcoming draft. October 23rd 2017",

Ltd (ASX: AFI) (AFIC) is the biggest listed investment company in Australia. \nIts focus has always been on the big blue chips like Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) , Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) , Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES) , Telstra Corporation Ltd (ASX: TLS) and BHP Billiton Limited (ASX: BHP) . \nThe returns that AFIC has generated over the past five years have been pretty good. It has created an average return of 9.7% per annum. When you include franking credits the average return per annum was 10.7%. \nThe problem with this type of investment strategy is that many of the biggest businesses have structural problems to deal with and this is where most of AFIC’s money is invested. \nThe big four banks are required to hold more capital so that they are stronger if trouble occurs. Wesfarmers has Amazon to contend with. Telstra has a lot to worry about with the NBN. The resources boom has been finished for a long time. \nTherefore, I was pleased to see that AFIC has paid a bit of attention to the changing landscape in its annual general meeting presentation, which was posted to the ASX recently. It said that the team would be taking more of a focus on the changes and opportunities that are going to occur such as Amazon, data growth or ageing demographics. \nIt’s a shift towards smaller, faster growing companies that will make sure AFIC at least stays up with the market. The big companies of Australia have big targets on their backs. \nIf AFIC can position more of its portfolio towards shares like Ramsay Health Care Limited (ASX: RHC) and Treasury Wine Estates Ltd (ASX: TWE) then it should have a bright future. \nFoolish takeaway \nAFIC will be making the right moves if it starts positioning its portfolio for this uncertain future. The shares AFIC intends to move towards should be good long-term options. \nIt’s currently trading with a grossed-up dividend yield of 5.77%. \nOUR #1 dividend pick to grow your wealth over the new financial year is revealed for FREE here! \nFinancial year 2018 is here and The Motley Fool's dividend detective Andrew Page has revealed his must buy dividend share to grow your wealth in 2018. \nYou might not know this market leader, but it's making waves in Asia and already boasts a term-deposit-crushing dividend above 4% .

      "text": "Are the Crows cursed by the No.6 jumper? premium_icon by Michelangelo Rucci \nCAN a sporting team be cursed? \nIn Boston, there was the baseball \"Curse of the Bambino\" with Babe Ruth's sale by the Red Sox to the New York Yankees. In Chicago, it was the Cubs - and the goat evicted from Wrigley Field during a World Series game. \nAnd now inaugural Crows coach Graham Cornes is wondering if - for the second time - the Adelaide Football Club is cursed ... or, at least, the No. 6 jumper is jinxed. \nThe first time, when Cornes was coach in the early 1990s, he felt the need to have an Aboriginal elder protect the Crows from extraordinary forces. It was the era in which Collingwood president Allan McAlister drew a curse on the Magpies in 1993 for his remarks about how Aboriginal people should behave after St Kilda hero Nicky Winmar stood up against racism. \nCollingwood went 18 years - and through four grand finals - before it won an AFL flag. \nNow Cornes is buying into the \"Modra curse\" at West Lakes. It has extraordinary similarities to the Ruth moment with the Red Sox in 1920. Former Crows star Tony Modra being carried off ground after playing his 150th AFL match for Fremantle. \nAt the end of the 1998 season, as the Crows were celebrating their second AFL flag, Modra was shipped to Fremantle after premiership coach Malcolm Blight had made the high-marking, goalkicking sensation clear his locker at West Lakes after a disastrous final against Melbourne at the MCG. \nSince then, Adelaide has lost four preliminary finals (2002, 2005, 2006 and 2012) and this year's grand final to Richmond. Cursed? \nBut more fascinating has been the storyline with the players who have inherited the No. 6 jumper made famous during Modra's 118-game, 440-goal career at Adelaide that delivered no premiership medal to the man they dubbed \"Godra\". \nModra missed the 1997 grand final with a knee injury suffered in the preliminary final win against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. He was cast away from the club for the last three finals of 1998. \nAnd since then the No. 6 jumper has been worn by James Byrne, Ben Nelson, Fergus Watts, Jonathon Griffin, Jack Gunston, Luke Thompson and Jake Lever. \nNone of these players can say they added to the fame of the No. 6 guernsey. None reached his 100-game milestone in No. 6 at Adelaide. Gunston, who has become a premiership hero at Hawthorn, and Lever, who has defected to Melbourne, had the promise ... but did not stay to fulfil the optimism at West Lakes. \nThompson would have felt cursed when he blew a chance to win for the Crows the last Showdown at Football Park in 2013. His errant shot at goal - while ignoring an unmarked Patrick Dangerfield at the top of the southern goalsquare - is as infamous as the Angus Monfries' off-break goal that won the derby for Port Adelaide. \nSo Cornes is now starting to wonder if there a \"Curse of the Bambino\" created by Modra's exile to Fremantle. Modra has returned to Adelaide, just as Ruth did to Boston after 21 years of unrivalled success with the Yankees. \nBut the curse took 86 years to clear from the Red Sox. \nThe Adelaide Football Club would hope Cornes has not hit on a jinx. Baseball star Babe Ruth for New York in 1932.",
