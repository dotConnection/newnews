      "text": "Poor governance, not players, will fail SA cricket 2017-10-24 13:15 5 talking points: Proteas v Bangladesh \nCape Town - It may 'only' be Bangladesh, but what the last month has revealed is that South African cricket is in a healthy state from a player perspective. \nIt generally always is, but the long-term future of the national set-up has been uncertain for a while now. \nThe 'old school' have been praise-worthy servants to the cause, but they are on their way out and the 2019 Cricket World Cup will be the death of one generation and the birth of the next. \nDale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander, Imran Tahir, JP Duminy, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers ... there is a good chance that all of those players are eyeing the 2019 showpiece as the end of the road. \nThe above-mentioned names have been massive for the Proteas over the years, and the prospect of them all leaving at the same time is understandably daunting. \nThe good news is that the post-2019 picture, while still not crystal clear, it is at least starting to take shape and that is thanks largely to the emergence of a few players during this Bangladesh tour. \nAiden Markram alone affords South African cricket fans a sigh of relief when contemplating the next decade. He is the real deal and must be protected. \nYoung Wiaan Mulder , at just 19, still has a long way to go but he also looked like he belonged when he was given a taste of international cricket this past weekend. He comes highly rated. \nThen there is the ever-improving Andile Phehlukwayo (21), the already-world class Kagiso Rabada (22) and the naturally superb Quinton de Kock (24). \nWith De Kock the most senior of those five players, there is all of a sudden a solid base to work with when plotting the way beyond 2019. \nAt 27, Keshav Maharaj can push through until 2023 while Temba Bavuma is the same age. \nOn Monday, there was more good news when 21-year-old Lungi Ngidi burst back onto the domestic scene with six wickets for the Titans against the Highveld Lions. \nNgidi has had a torrid time with a back injury, but he looks to have put that behind him. He has raw pace and the potential to be destructive, and he has already shown glimpses of that on the international stage. \nThe young talent, it seems, is there to work with and from that perspective South African cricket seems healthy enough. \nBut while the past month has inspired confidence on the field, the developments off of it have been concerning. \nThere is still no clarity as to exactly what brought about the sudden departure of CSA CEO Haroon Lorgat with a little over a month to go until the start of the T20 Global League. \nA breakdown in communication seems evident, and the CSA board has suggested that it was not kept in the loop when it came to key decisions surrounding the tournament. \nBut, as the board, why did they not insist that they were kept in the loop? If they did not know the intricacies of the planning for what was billed a mega-event, then they must be held accountable for that too. \nAn internal investigation is ongoing, we are told, and we must wait for those findings, but from the outside looking in the leadership at CSA has been all over the place in the last six weeks. \nThe hype surrounding the Global League amounted to nothing and its postponement will have left a large number of domestic players who were banking on that Christmas pay-day seething. That is not great given that one of the major aims of this tournament was to prevent local players from moving abroad. \nWith a big summer ahead and series against India and Australia on the cards, there will be enough exciting cricket to keep us distracted. \nBut, in that time, CSA needs to get its house in order. \nWhile the future of the Proteas is beginning to take shape, the future of CSA is as murky as ever. \nFor the players to succeed, there needs to be sound administration. CSA needs a leader, and quickly. Lloyd Burnard is a journalist at Sport24 and the former Sports Editor of The Witness newspaper ...

      "text": "Mohalenyane Phakela \nTHE producer of the world recognised film The Lost Cause has pleaded for investment in the local film industry to enable film producers and other players in the sector to tell Lesotho’s rich stories and thus sell the country to the rest of the world. \nUpcoming filmmaker, Lebohang Motlomelo, recently told Xpress People that having his zero budget film recognised overseas proves that Lesotho’s film industry has the potential to become a world-beater. \nThe Lost Cause garnered further international recognition when it was screened at the 8th Silicon Valley African Film Festival from 29 September to 1 October 2017 in Silicon Valley in the United States of America (USA). \nIt had already been screened at the Dieciminuti Film Festival (DFF) in Italy from 24 to 28 January this year, at the UK Screen One International Film Festival on 24 March and the Screen Test Student Film Festival in Chicago, USA on 22 April 2017. \nIt was voted the Best Student Film at the Lesotho Film Festival 2016 in November last year. \nThe film tells a story of lost love within a nation. It follows a young boy (Mosiuoa) who is left alone in the world filled with hatred when his brother (Ramonne) leaves for the liberation army camp four years after their father’s capture by the army. \nThe Silicon Valley African Film Festival was the first overseas screening which Motlomelo managed to attend after Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, Software24Seven and GEM Institute collaborated to sponsor his transport costs. \nMotlomelo – a Broadcasting and Journalism graduate from Limkokwing University in Maseru, said that although his film did not win, he was able to tell Lesotho’s story. \n“The Lost Cause was nominated for an award in the Short Narrative Category and even though it did not scoop the award, it was fortunate enough to be part of the building blocks in the growth of film industry in Lesotho,” Motlomelo said. \n“As a director, I received a Certificate of Recognition from the California State Assembly. I was also interviewed by two of the media practitioners, the Jason Dunford social media blog and African Technology Foundation and I shared my story with the people of the United States of America and the world at large.” \nHe said that taking his film to global markets indicated personal growth, adding it was “amusing and shocking at the same time for a zero budget film to stand toe to toe with some of the world’s top films. \nMotlomelo also said he realised there was a huge demand for Lesotho stories hence the need to support local film-makers to better sell Lesotho to other nations. \n“The festival provided enough space for networking with fellow Africans, and Americans towards creating opportunities and connecting communities for growth, business and human relationships. Among others, the Africa Video on Demand delegates gave a presentation on how they will to collaborate with African filmmakers in their film distribution portal. \n“During the festival, I met people who are eager to know about the tiny Mountain Kingdom and its mysteries, the stories of Basotho, their traditions and culture. \n“In Lesotho, the film industry is still in its infancy therefore there is a guaranteed chance of growth should there be support from government, the corporate sector and public in general. \n“The success of African cinema lies with African filmmakers but filmmakers cannot sustain the industry on their own. There is a dire need for support and investment for the industry to succeed,” he said.",

Picture: Mike Hutchings/Reuters \nPretoria - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is opposing President Jacob Zuma’s application of a judicial review of the state capture findings and will argue that in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, he has a duty to adhere to the remedial action required in the State of Capture report. \nPublic Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said she will bring a counter application - if the court ruled in Zuma's favour - that her office be placed in funds to take the investigation into state capture further. \nZuma is asking the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, to set aside former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's findings that a commission of inquiry must be set up. \nThe report was released in November last year, following an unsuccessful legal bid by the president to block its release. \nMadonsela said in her report that Zuma had to set up a judicial commission of inquiry into the findings of the State of Capture Report, but that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng had to appoint a judge to head the commission. \nZuma was given 30 days to appoint the commission, which had lapsed in December. \nTen months later the commission was still not appointed and the Democratic Alliance last month asked for a court order compelling Zuma to immediately establish a judicial commission of inquiry. \nBut Zuma’s camp argued that in light of his pending review application of the State of Capture Report he was under no obligation to set up the inquiry at this stage. \nThe court agreed and gave Zuma a lifeline pending the outcome of this week’s review proceedings. \nJudge M A Makume earlier said the DA has failed to demonstrate what prejudice or harm it will suffer if the president does not appoint a commission of inquiry now. \n“Nothing has happened in the last 10 months. It will therefore not make any difference if the commission is appointed after the review shall have been heard, should the president fail in his application to set aside the remedial action,\" the judge said. \nKicking off Tuesday's application by Zuma, Advocate Ishmail Semenya, acting for Zuma, argued at length that Madonsela did not have the power to instruct the president to appoint a commission and to instruct him to exercise his power through the chief justice. The power to appoint a commission on inquiry is that of the president, he argued. \nSemenya said the Public Protector is an organ of State and limited by the separation of powers. He said the remedial action she called for is thus invalid. \nHe said the Constitution and the Public Protectors Act confers the powers on the public protector to investigate any conduct in the state's affairs that is suspected to be improper, to report on it and to take appropriate remedial action. \nHe said in this case the public protector is outsourcing her powers to a commission of inquiry to take her investigation further due to a lack of resources. \nBut according to Semenya, a commission of inquiry cannot do this. He said Zuma in any event in Parliament said he will appoint a commission on his own time to investigate all the Gupta related issues and not only the recommendations made in the State of Capture report. \nJudge President Dunstan Mlambo questioned Semenya on how the public must view the fact that he had done nothing about it up to now. \nMlambo said Zuma knew from April last year that the Public Protector was investigating complaints brought against him and organs of state regarding their alleged relationship with the Gupta family. \nIn October last year, after a brief meeting with Madonsela, he brought an application to halt the issuing of the report. Mlambo said we are now 18 months down the line and still Zuma had done nothing about the allegations. \n\"Serious allegations of state capture were levelled against him. He did nothing other than tell parliament he will institute a commission. Is this what one can expect from a reasonable president in a democracy,\" the judge asked. \nSemenya responded that this avenue was not open to him until he had reviewed and set aside the report. \" He was legally incapable of doing so until the review is heard,\" Semenya said.",

The next day the family became worried and started to look for her but could not find her.\" \nThe matter was reported to the local police and a search was conducted with the assistance of the community members. On 10 September, the body was found next to the road at Sunrise Forest in the area with severe injuries. It appeared that she was chopped up with a bush knife. Both arms and a head were missing. \nA case of murder was opened at Donnybrook police station for further investigation. Through investigation the suspect was arrested on the same day and took the police to where she had left the victim's body parts. \nOnly one arm was found and the second arm, as well as the head, are still missing. The suspect was charged accordingly and taken to court. \nKwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, condemned the brutal killing of the victim. “It is unbelievable that a woman can allegedly attack and kill another woman in such a cruel manner. Our detectives will thoroughly investigate this case and find out the root cause of such killing,” he said.",

      "text": "Gerotek At present SA National Defence Force (SANDF) HQ is housed in the Armscor building in the Pretoria east suburb Erasmuskloof. The Defence Ministry and Defence Secretariat is also housed in there with DI currently in a Pretoria CBD building. The net effect would be, once the new Defence HQ, as stated in the annual report, is up and operational, that Armscor gains a tenant – DI – and will provide office space and other business facilities to existing clients – the SANDF and the Defence Ministry and Secretariat. No indication is given in the annual report as to whether the Ministry, Secretariat and DI will also eventually be housed at Gerotek, west of Pretoria just before Hartbeespoort Dam. The report does point out that “construction of a DI HQ building at Gerotek” is an activity it is focussing on. Another component of the Armscor financial turnaround and business re-orientation is a sustainability unit. Its role, according to the annual report, is to fast track exploitation of opportunities identified for revenue generation. “To this end engagement with various international and local stakeholders such as multi-national organisations, the SA defence industry and government departments have promoted Armscor services and follow-up on potential clients.” Progress made includes brokering the sale of military equipment (no equipment is named in the annual report) for Nigeria and Zambia. Another part of this wider revenue generation is increasing South African industry’s participation in UN procurement spend. “A Team SA approach was adopted, as the view is to support not just defence, but the wider South African industry and a multi-organisational approach to opportunities. This approach is flourishing as Armscor, CSIR and Denel visited the UN Headquarters in New York to widen South African Defence participation in UN Field support. In addition, 26 UN defence attaches (sic) of African countries were addressed on further relationships, and possible partnering opportunities are being explored. The Sustainability Unit is focused on building relationships with the local defence industry and other African nations,” according to the report.",

      "text": "By Black Opinion October 23, 2017 \nThe following is an excerpt from Dr Blade Nzimande’s review of President Jacob Zuma’s biography by Jeremy Gordin in 2009. “For me when I first met JZ [Jacob Zuma] in 1990, I honestly thought that his laughter was fake and pretension, and may perhaps be confirming his name Gedleyihlekisa. It was only after months that I realized that it is a genuine laugh, coming from deep down his heart.” A Black Opinion writer reports \nThis is what Nzimande said about Zuma back then: I have also come to understand JZ as someone who bears no grudges and accepts debate and different views, even to his own, without bursting out or even labelling those who hold contrary views. I myself have in the past had differences with Cde Zuma. I recall we were on the different sides of the debate on how to deal with the counter-revolutionary violence of the IFP and the apartheid regime in KwaZulu-Natal in the 1990s. I was amongst those who were extremely suspicious and uncomfortable about what we saw as Zuma’s overemphasis on talks with the IFP at the expense of self-defence for our communities. But it was due to those robust debates that we all came to understand that it was not an ‘either or’ issue, but the question of an appropriate balance between the two. \nAgain in the mid-1990s, the regional executive committee of the ANC in the Natal Midlands was divided around Sifiso Nkabinde, after we had been reliably informed in the early 1990s that Nkabinde was working for apartheid’s notorious special branch. Zuma called us into a number of meetings to try and resolve our differences. I remember telling him rather angrily (at the time I was already a member of the ANC NEC) why was he forcing a discussion on Nkabinde instead of ensuring that he is expelled, as some of us were arguing? \nIt was much later, after the expulsion of Nkabinde, in a quiet engagement with him, that he told us that it was important to try and forge unity for a while, as we could not afford a serious division inside the ANC when faced with intense violence from the IFP. Indeed this was an important tactical consideration that played an important role in bringing about peace in the KZN province. \nBlack Opinion writes that contrary to the recent condescending characterizations of the ANC president by Nzimande – the latest being reported by the late author Heidi Holland, referring to him as an ‘ideological barbarian’ – Zuma was previously referred by him as being an ‘organic intellectual’. \nThe opinion above is that of Black First Land First as carried in Black Opinion, its mouthpiece. Blade Nzmimande was fired as Higher Education and Training Minister from President Zuma’s cabinet last week.",

      "text": "By John Fraser October 23, 2017 \nMike Whitfield is the head of Nissan in Southern Africa. The company has an auto plant at Rosslyn, near Pretoria, where The Cape Messenger’s Associate Editor John Fraser chatted to him. \nJF. What was your first car? \nMW. It was a Datsun 149Y GX Coupe. I think it was yellow, and I got it cheap because no-one wanted a yellow car. I have never owned any other brand, although I briefly drove an Alfa when we distributed them. \nJF. The government has an incentive support programme for the automotive industry. How has this programme worked? \nMW. We have had a consistent government programme in different iterations. A long-term policy is vital. Without it, we would be like Australia, where the last automotive plant closed this week. The auto industry in South Africa is a big exporter. Direct and indirect employment is close to 80 000, and that’s excluding the dealers. Without this consistent policy, we would not be here. Why build here, and ship the vehicles 12 000km north – unless there is good reason to do so? Now we must build on this policy – grow volumes, introduce more localisation and jobs. The motor industry brings skills and good, sustainable jobs. Not entry-level jobs. The current programme may not have delivered the one million units which were the target, but without it, what would we be building? We would be like Australia. \nJF. Do you accept the industry needs more BEE? \nMW. If we operate in this country, we must play within the rules of this country. We need better stakeholder engagement. However, we do not need to do this through equity. The industry has a responsibility to support empowerment through various mechanisms. One thing we share publicly is a venture fund to develop black-owned businesses, particularly from our supplier base. We want to drive localisation and employment. However, with a global multinational manufacturing operation, it is not always viable to have local equity. Personally, I am committed to support and implement solutions. \nJF. What is the attraction of Rosslyn? \nMW. We are here historically. If you were to build an auto plant today, it is guaranteed it would be at a port at the coast. The structure of the automotive industry is more export-based. Rosslyn was part of the old apartheid era, and this was an industrial zone, with the infrastructure to locate here. In the early 1960s, nobody thought we in South Africa would be a good exporter. \nJF. What then are the challenges with logistics? \nMW. The primary focus is transport by rail and road, with exports through Durban and Coega. It is a big challenge. Logistics plays a big role in making us competitive. We need more competitive port charges. \nJF. Do you enjoy driving? \nMW. I love it. But I don’t enjoy the traffic. \nJF. We already have electric cars. Are you surprised by the speed of change in your industry? \nMW. The pace of change from what we know today – in terms of intelligent mobility – is due to exponential growth of new technology. Not just petrol to electricity, but also autonomous driving. There are more collaborations between the OEMs (car giants) and IT businesses. We will see different ownership mechanisms, fractional ownership. Do you need to own a car? We still see Africa as the last frontier. The growth of the auto industry in SA will be through the expansion of the industry in sub-Saharan Africa. \nJF. You need to win investment in competition with other Nissan plants around the world. What are the challenges in winning investment for South Africa? \nMW. We operate in 40 to 50 countries in the world. They all have volatility and challenges, political and economic. We look for long-term stability and we understand the shorter spikes. We make investment decisions now for production to the end of 2020 to 2025. We look for more stability, and we understand the spikes. We are disappointed SA is not delivering on its potential. Today SA is the most attractive country in Africa for our type of investment. We look for stability and we do understand the short-term challenges. \nJF. What annoys you most about other drivers? \nMW. People sitting in the fast lane, using it to travel, instead of overtaking. \nJF. Which driving rule or regulation would you overturn? \nMW. A rule which needs to be applied more is dealing with people who are on their mobile phones while driving. This is a big contributor to road fatalities. The level of road fatalities in South Africa is totally inconceivable and unacceptable.",

      "text": "Home » News » Department of agriculture to help farmers stop the spread of bird flu Department of agriculture to help farmers stop the spread of bird flu \nJohannesburg – A total of 92 locations have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also known as bird flu, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has confirmed. \nThe department said in a statement that affected birds are divided into distinct categories, namely, commercial poultry, backyard poultry, ostriches, hobby birds and wild birds. The largest numbers of outbreaks are on commercial farms, with the Western Cape having the highest number of wild bird outbreaks, read a statement. \nLimpopo and the Northern Cape have not been affected. \nA total of 61 outbreaks have been reported in the Western Cape, 13 in Gauteng, 11 in Mpumalanga, two in the North West, Eastern Cape and the Free State, and one in KwaZulu-Natal. \nThe first case of HPAI was confirmed in a broiler breeder operation in Mpumalanga in June 2017. Since then a number of other poultry and ostrich operations, as well as wild bird species, hobby birds and backyard chickens have subsequently been infected, read a statement. \n“Quarantine, culling and safe disposal of infected chickens and other poultry as soon as possible after detection of infection is the most effective way to eradicate and to stop the spread of disease,” the department said, adding that endangered and rare birds at zoos would be vaccinated and be exempt from culling. \nCompensation legislation being drafted \nThe Provincial Veterinary Services has been tasked with controlling the movement of live commercial chickens in an effort to stop the spread of the disease from one affected property to another. \n“A system was introduced to allow for movement of healthy live chickens for purposes other than for slaughter. Provincial Veterinary Services issued health attestations for small-scale farmers and distributors of live chickens and the Poultry Disease Management Agency (PDMA) was authorised by DAFF (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) to register and keep records of all parties selling and buying live chickens,” read the statement. The department said this was a successful preventative measure for small-scale farmers and backyard breeders. \nThe department has also worked closely with stakeholders and experts, looking at a vaccination strategy against bird flu as a control measure, but warning of its negative effects on trade. \n“[The department] is also working closely with the industry to promote ongoing food security through the importation of fertile broiler hatching eggs, thereby addressing the shortage in the market, while at the same time ensuring that such imports are allowed in a safe manner so as not to jeopardise the health status of our national poultry flock.” \nLegislation is currently being drafted with guidelines on compensation of farmers affected by bird flu. \n“It is important to note that compensation is at the discretion of the minister and only payable for losses suffered due to the destruction of healthy birds and eggs in an effort to eradicate the disease,” read the statement.",

The certification is an internationally-recognised metric to validate the quality of a company’s management systems. Since its establishment, the company has constructed over 12,5 MW of solar systems, mainly on commercial and industrial buildings, retail centres and micro-grids. The ISO 9001:2015 certification was awarded once a process of internal and external auditing of the company’s ability to design, construct and maintain solar PV systems was completed. The company recently signed an agreement with Atterbury Property Developments to provide PV for its portfolio of properties, and has also opened a Johannesburg branch to service clients across Africa. The ISO 9001:2015 certificate is valid for three years and the company will undergo yearly audits. \nContact Kate Pallett, SolaFuture Energy, Tel 021 421-9764,",

      "text": "Ernest Mabuza 0 Comment \nThe High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday hear an application by President Jacob Zuma to set aside the remedial action by former public protector Thuli Madonsela on alleged state capture. \nMadonsela released a report‚ titled State of Capture‚ in November last year concerning allegations of an improper relationship between Zuma‚ other state officials and the Gupta family. \nThe report recommended that‚ because Madonsela did not have enough funds to finalise the investigation‚ Zuma appoint a commission of inquiry to complete the investigation. \nMadonsela recommended that the commission be established by Zuma but that the presiding judge should be chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. \nZuma took issue with the remedial action and applied to court to have it reviewed and set aside. \nZuma believes the public protector has no right to tell him who should appoint a judge to head up the inquiry. \nZuma also asked for an order sending the State of Capture report back to the public protector for further investigation. \nIn his application filed in December last year‚ Zuma said the remedial action was unlawful as it went against the separation of powers doctrine. \n“The Public Protector is directing remedial action in areas in which the Constitution has left to the Executive‚” Zuma said. \nZuma said Section 84(2)(f) of the constitution provided that the president of the country was responsible for “appointing commissions of inquiry”. \nZuma said the public protector did not have the power to direct the chief justice to select a judge to head the judicial inquiry. \n“Again‚ this power can only be exercised by a President.” \nThe public protector had said Zuma could not decide who should chair the commission because he has a direct personal interest in the inquiry’s outcome. \n“The Public Protector observed on numerous grounds that the President may have violated his obligations to avoid a conflict of interest under section 2.3 of the Executive Ethics Code.” \nMadonsela’s successor‚ Busisiwe Mkhwebane‚ said her office had observed that Zuma may not have acted in line with his duty of professional ethics. \n“Section 96 of the Constitution accordingly precludes the President from retaining control over the commission‚ as he is alleged to have a direct personal or financial interest in the outcome of the commission‚” Mkhwebane said in her affidavit.

By Sifiso Jimta Tuesday, October 24, 2017 05:30 ~ \nPOLICE Minister Fikile Mbalula yesterday visited the house where Nigerians allegedly attacked six cops recently. \nMbalula claimed the cops were on duty and found a body in the house in Vanderbijlpark, in the Vaal. \n“A group of Nigerians attacked the police,” he claimed. \n“The people on the premises were undermining the law and police reacted sharply.” \nThe minister was accompanied by acting national commissioner Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba and Gauteng commissioner Major-General Deliwe de Lange . \nDaily Sun reported the death of Ibrahim Badmus (25), whom witnesses and family members claim cops suffocated on the premises with a plastic bag during a raid. \nWhen angry relatives arrived, they took his lifeless body and put him in the cop van, demanding that cops eat him or bury him. \nMbalula said cases have been opened against the attackers, who are on the run. “One of the cops almost lost his ear.” \nHe said in a raid yesterday 76 people were bust. \nMbalula said the people involved in the assault are wanted by the cops and are believed to have fled to Kempton Park and Joburg. \nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Consulate said they are waiting for the autopsy results. “We do not wish to challenge anyone, as it is under investigation. Badmus will be buried after the autopsy.” Comment on this story",

By Sun Reporter Tuesday, October 24, 2017 08:49 ~ \nThe North Gauteng High Court is on Tuesday expected to hear President Jacob Zuma's application to review the remedial action contained in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. \nThe case has been set down for three days. \nNews24 previously reported that Zuma filed an application with the High Court to have Madonsela's report reviewed and set aside. \nHe said the former Public Protector had encroached on the role of the executive in her recommendations. \nMadonsela was looking into allegations of an improper relationship between the president and the influential Gupta family in relation to key appointments in Zuma's Cabinet and the awarding of contracts at state-owned enterprises. \nThe former Public Protector said she didn't have the necessary resources to finish her investigation into state capture and recommended a judicial inquiry, which was to be appointed by the President. \nHowever, she said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should be tasked with choosing a judge to head up the commission. \nDA federal chairperson James Selfe previously told News24 that the Nkandla judgment obliged Zuma to carry out remedial action unless it is set aside, and that was not done in this matter.",

Photo: Johan Rynners/BackpagePix \nCAPE TOWN - Western Province coach John Dobson is hoping flank Jaco Coetzee is “going to make it” for Saturday’s Currie Cup final against the Sharks, but knows Sikhumbuzo Notshe can fill the breach if need be. \nCoetzee was set for a battle royal with the Du Preez brothers (Jean-Luc and Daniel) at Kings Park, but looks unlikely to make the trip to Durban after being forced to exit Saturday’s Currie Cup semi-final against the Lions with a head knock. He has since failed his sideline head injury assessment. \n“We will give Jaco until later in the week because the protocols escalate day by day as to the amount of contact he can take and he’s not there yet” Dobson said. \n“It would be a big loss if he didn’t play because he has serious stopping power. That’s why we will give him until as late as we can but I hope he is going to make it.” \nNotshe, though, has eased Dobson’s somewhat concerns after the former Wynberg Boys prodigy produced a barnstorming performance after replacing Coetzee after just 21 minutes. \n“He (Notshe) did a great job when he came on and if he has to start at No 6 in the final he will have to alter his game slightly like he did last weekend. Notch is a bit like Nemo (Nizaam Carr) in that he is a No 8,” Dobson explained. \nCape Argus",

      "text": "Mohalenyane Phakela \nTHE producer of the world recognised film The Lost Cause has pleaded for investment in the local film industry to enable film producers and other players in the sector to tell Lesotho’s rich stories and thus sell the country to the rest of the world. \nUpcoming filmmaker, Lebohang Motlomelo, recently told Xpress People that having his zero budget film recognised overseas proves that Lesotho’s film industry has the potential to become a world-beater. \nThe Lost Cause garnered further international recognition when it was screened at the 8th Silicon Valley African Film Festival from 29 September to 1 October 2017 in Silicon Valley in the United States of America (USA). \nIt had already been screened at the Dieciminuti Film Festival (DFF) in Italy from 24 to 28 January this year, at the UK Screen One International Film Festival on 24 March and the Screen Test Student Film Festival in Chicago, USA on 22 April 2017. \nIt was voted the Best Student Film at the Lesotho Film Festival 2016 in November last year. \nThe film tells a story of lost love within a nation. It follows a young boy (Mosiuoa) who is left alone in the world filled with hatred when his brother (Ramonne) leaves for the liberation army camp four years after their father’s capture by the army. \nThe Silicon Valley African Film Festival was the first overseas screening which Motlomelo managed to attend after Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, Software24Seven and GEM Institute collaborated to sponsor his transport costs. \nMotlomelo – a Broadcasting and Journalism graduate from Limkokwing University in Maseru, said that although his film did not win, he was able to tell Lesotho’s story. \n“The Lost Cause was nominated for an award in the Short Narrative Category and even though it did not scoop the award, it was fortunate enough to be part of the building blocks in the growth of film industry in Lesotho,” Motlomelo said. \n“As a director, I received a Certificate of Recognition from the California State Assembly. I was also interviewed by two of the media practitioners, the Jason Dunford social media blog and African Technology Foundation and I shared my story with the people of the United States of America and the world at large.” \nHe said that taking his film to global markets indicated personal growth, adding it was “amusing and shocking at the same time for a zero budget film to stand toe to toe with some of the world’s top films. \nMotlomelo also said he realised there was a huge demand for Lesotho stories hence the need to support local film-makers to better sell Lesotho to other nations. \n“The festival provided enough space for networking with fellow Africans, and Americans towards creating opportunities and connecting communities for growth, business and human relationships. Among others, the Africa Video on Demand delegates gave a presentation on how they will to collaborate with African filmmakers in their film distribution portal. \n“During the festival, I met people who are eager to know about the tiny Mountain Kingdom and its mysteries, the stories of Basotho, their traditions and culture. \n“In Lesotho, the film industry is still in its infancy therefore there is a guaranteed chance of growth should there be support from government, the corporate sector and public in general. \n“The success of African cinema lies with African filmmakers but filmmakers cannot sustain the industry on their own. There is a dire need for support and investment for the industry to succeed,” he said.",

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, has appealed to the Federal Government to hand over federal roads in the country to the state governments for effective management so as to ensure long term viability. He made the appeal when he received the Senate Committee on Works led by its Chairman, Senator Kabiru Gaya , at the Government House in Sokoto late on Monday, October 23, 2017. \"There is the need for the federal government to hand over the roads to states because state governments are closer to the people and we have more efficient methods of supervision. \"If this is done, it will go a long way in ensuring that the vast majority of major roads and highways in the country are well maintained,\" he said. Tambuwal said Sokoto State government will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that the infrastructural development of Nigeria is given utmost attention. He equally solicited the support of the National Assembly to facilitate the reimbursement of the money the state government spent on the repairs of some federal roads in its domain. In his remarks, Senator Gaya said they were in the state for the conduct of their oversight functions. He lauded Tambuwal's efforts especially in the area of infrastructural development. ALSO READ: Sokoto government to construct N2.8 billion water schemes Senator Gaya also assured that his committee will facilitate the reimbursement of the funds used by the state government in the repairs of federal roads. He particularly thanked Governor Tambuwal for his commitment to see to the completion of the Sokoto-Jega-Yauri-Kontagora road which is currently under construction.

      "text": "Dollar Climbs to Three-month High, Adds 0.25% Dollar Climbs to Three-month High, Adds 0.25% - October 24, 2017 0 \nThe United States of America dollar touched a three-month high against the yen on Monday, October 23, with an emphatic election victory for Japan’s ruling party keeping yen-weakening stimulus measures at the heart of government policy. \nThe greenback had already gained about 0.9 percent on Friday after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, clearing a critical hurdle for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support. \nThe dollar was supported as U.S. yields rose, with the two-year yield hitting a nine-year high, as the progress in tax reforms boosted expectations of increased U.S. Government borrowing and a possible pickup in inflation. \nThe greenback had already gained about 0.9 percent on Friday after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, clearing a critical hurdle for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support. \nThe U.S. currency was up 0.25 percent at 113.79 JPY=, losing a bit of momentum after earlier touching 114.10, its highest since July 11. \nThe dollar was supported as U.S. yields rose, with the two-year yield hitting a nine-year high, as the progress in tax reforms boosted expectations of increased U.S. Government borrowing and a possible pickup in inflation. \nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling party scored a big win in Sunday’s election with his coalition keeping its two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house, local media said. \nAbe’s victory eased fears that the economic steps implemented under his leadership – such as the Bank of Japan’s super easy monetary policy – would be disrupted and halt the yen’s depreciation against the dollar. \n“An LDP win did not come as a surprise, but it still helped clear uncertainty that had been preventing participants from buying the dollar,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. \n“Overcoming deflation with the BOJ easing is at the crux of the Abe administration’s policies and this will now be allowed to continue indefinitely. It’s relief over the BOJ policies, rather than hopes for fresh fiscal stimulus, that is weakening the yen.” \nMasashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo, said dollar/yen-supportive election elation was likely to peter out relatively quickly, with market focus returning to U.S. factors like tax reform efforts. \n“The election outcome means the Abe administration will retain the status quo, making no changes, and continue with its policies,” Murata said. “It will find little need for fresh steps when the GDP has registered six quarters of growth, unemployment is under 3 percent and the Nikkei is above 21,000.” \nAnother focal point for the dollar was who U.S. President Donald Trump would appoint as the next Federal Reserve chief. Investors are hoping whoever is nominated pursues the same monetary policy that has supported rising stock prices for the past nine years. \nThe euro was 0.15 percent lower at $1.1769 EUR=, extending losses from Friday when it lost 0.6 percent. \nThe common currency has drifted lower from a 2-1/2-year peak of $1.2092 scaled on Sept. 8, as hopes for the European Central Bank to take a more hawkish stance have been tempered by speculation that it is not be in a hurry to taper its easy policy. \nThe ECB holds a policy meeting on Thursday, at which policymakers are seen cutting bond purchases but voting for an extension in stimulus. \nThe political situation in Europe has also been a drag for the euro, with the Spanish government having taken desperate steps over the weekend to thwart Catalonia’s bid for independence. \nAccording to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, speculators trimmed their net long euro positions in the week to Oct. 17 to $13.303 billion from the previous week’s $14.474 billion, which was the highest since 2011. \nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose to 93.872, its highest since Oct. 6, before pulling back to 93.767, up 0.05 percent on the day. \nThe New Zealand dollar, battered last week by a change in government, slipped to a five-month low of $0.6932 NZD=D4 against the broadly stronger U.S. currency and last traded at $0.6964. The kiwi shed about 3 percent last week.",

      "text": "Jailed Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong released on bail October 24, 2017 0 39 \nJailed democracy activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law were released on bail Tuesday pending an appeal against convictions for their role in the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. \nThe jail sentences handed down by the city’s Court of Appeal in August came amid mounting fears that Beijing is tightening its grip on the semi-autonomous city and that rule of law is being compromised. \nWong, 21, who became the face of the mass pro-democracy protests while still a teenager, was jailed for six months while Law, 24, was imprisoned for eight months. \nThey were granted bail at the Court of Final Appeal until November 7, the first appearance in the appeal proceedings. \nA third activist, Alex Chow, who was jailed for seven months alongside Law and Wong, was not part of Tuesday’s hearing. \nWong’s father Roger, who has heavily criticised his son’s imprisonment, was at the court. \nSupporters outside punched the air at news of the pair’s release. \nLawmaker Eddie Chu said their release on bail was “encouraging news for supporters of democracy”. \n“We need them out here with us to fight these battles,” he told AFP outside the court. \nBy late morning Wong and Law were yet to emerge as they completed paperwork with their legal teams. \nThe Umbrella trio were found guilty last year on unlawful assembly charges for storming a fenced-off government forecourt known as “Civic Square” as part of a September 2014 protest calling for fully free leadership elections. \nTheir arrests sparked wider rallies which exploded two days later when police fired tear gas on the crowds, triggering demonstrations that brought parts of Hong Kong to a standstill for more than two months in an unprecedented challenge to Beijing. \nWong and Law initially received community sentences and Chow a three-week suspended sentence at a magistrates’ court over the Civic Square protest. \nBut Hong Kong’s justice department then sought to increase those terms, with prosecutors arguing they should receive harsher punishment. \nThe judgement jailing them in August said the court must “send out a clear message to society” that protesters must abide by the law. \nWong’s imprisonment prevented him from running for Hong Kong’s partially directly elected parliament, something he said he had wanted to do. He had been waiting to turn 21 to become eligible to stand. \nWong celebrated that landmark birthday in jail last month. \nWong and Law each offered cash bail of HK$50,000 ($6,400) Tuesday. They were required to surrender their passports, not leave Hong Kong and report to police once a week as part of the terms. \nWong is yet to be sentenced on a separate charge of contempt for obstructing the clearance of a major encampment during the Umbrella Movement rallies. \nHe has pleaded guilty to that charge. \nOther activists previously sentenced on contempt charges have received sentences of up to three months. \n-AFP",

      "text": "U.S. lawmakers ask DOJ if terrorism law covers pipeline activists By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. representatives from both parties asked the Department of Justice on Monday whether the domestic terrorism law would cover actions by protesters that shut oil pipelines last year, a move that could potentially increase political rhetoric against climate change activists. Ken Buck, a Republican representative from Colorado, said in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that damaging pipeline infrastructure poses risks to humans and the environment. The letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said \"operation of pipeline facilities by unqualified personnel could result in a rupture - the consequences of which would be devastating.\" It was signed by 84 representatives, including at least two Democrats, Gene Green and Henry Cuellar, both of Texas. The move by the lawmakers is a sign of increasing tensions between activists protesting projects including Energy Transfer Partners LP's Dakota Access Pipeline and the administration of President Donald Trump, which is seeking to make the country \"energy dominant\" by boosting domestic oil, gas, and coal output. Last year activists in several states used bolt cutters to break fences and twisted shut valves on several cross border pipelines that sent about 2.8 million barrels per day of crude to the United States from Canada, equal to roughly 15 percent of daily U.S. consumption. The letter asks Sessions whether existing federal laws arm the Justice Department to prosecute criminal activity against energy infrastructure. It also asks whether attacks on energy infrastructure that pose a threat to human life fall within the department's understanding of domestic terrorism law. The Department of Justice acknowledged receiving the letter and is reviewing it, a spokesman said. A terrorism expert said it was ironic the lawmakers referred to the law, which defines \"domestic terrorism\" as acts dangerous to human life intended to intimidate civilians, but does not offer a way to prosecute anyone under it. David Schanzer, a homeland security and terrorism expert at Duke University, said the lawmakers' request of Sessions \"won't have any legal ramifications, but possibly could be used for rhetorical value.\" A Minnesota court is considering charges against several protesters suspected of turning the valves on the pipelines last year. District Court Judge Robert Tiffany has allowed the defendants to present a \"necessity defense.\" That means they will admit shutting the valves, but may call witnesses, such as scientific experts, to offer testimony about the urgency of what they say is a climate crisis, activists said.

      "text": "41 minutes ago General Sun News 10 The Nigeria Basketball Federation has invited 16 players to camp for the FIBA Africa organized 3×3 championships to be held in Lome, Togo. The 3×3 men and women’s teams would be in camp for 8 days for the championship starting from the 1st of November. The Women’s team would be led by Nkechi Akashili and Chioma Udeaja both of First Bank Women Basketball Club of Lagos who were members of the 2017 Afrobasket women championship winning team in Mali. The list released on Monday also has Chidinma Deborah and Nkemuwa Akaraiwe of First Bank who were also part of the Afrobasket preparation. IGP Queens Basketball club duo of Grace Okonkwo and Christiana Isaac and Dolphins’ Roselyn Queen Ulabo as well as Josette Anaswem complete the list of invited players. For the men, eight players were drawn from Kano Pillars, Civil Defence, Rivers Hoopers and Kwara Falcons for the apex 3×3 basketball event in Africa. Yahaya Abdul, Azuoma Dike and Lucky Subel were invited from Pillars for the camping exercise, which would be held at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium, Lagos. Joel Ijigba of Civil Defence would be making his national team debut following an impressive season with Civil Defence if selected for the competition while the duo of River Hoopers of Port Harcourt players, Alalibo Owelem Ronald and Ebikoro Dennis Eteimowei and Kwara Falcons’ David Godwin complete the list of invited players for the men. The team will be coordinated by the Federal Capital Territory Basketball Chairman who is the Director of 3×3 Nigeria, Frank Jituboh. Fifa said the award was shortlisted with input from national team coaches, national team captains, media representatives and fans, with each group getting a one quarter weighting. “The process is clear and transparent and we are not involved in the final selection of nominees,” Fifa said in a statement. “However, we have taken note of the concerns raised by the football community and our fans and will take this feedback on board in future editions of The Best Awards.” But Rapinoe said football’s world governing body should have stepped in. “If some random male player, who was not even a full professional, was nominated, I’m sure they would step in for that, so it’s disappointing that the same hasn’t been done for us,” she said. Castellanos plays for the Florida State university team and had never represented Venezuela at senior or even under-20 level. She has 14 goals in 15 games so far for Florida State this season and six in nine for Santa Clarita Blue Heat – the Californian pro-am outfit she turned out for in the off-season. The awards recognise performances between November 2016 and August 2017, and the winner will be announced at a ceremony at the London Palladium on Monday evening. Conspicuous by their absence from the shortlist are players like Australia forward Sam Kerr, who became the all-time leading scorer in the National Women’s Soccer League in the United States, and England striker Jodie Taylor, who was top scorer at Euro 2017.",

      "text": "General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says the Pentagon plans a full investigation into the October 4 ambush in Niger. (GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP)   The United States will maintain its large military presence in Niger to assist local forces despite the deaths of four American soldiers in an ambush, the Pentagon's top officer said Monday. Nearly three weeks after jihadists attacked a joint US-Niger patrol in a sensitive border area, General Joseph Dunford , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the US is firmly committed to supporting Nigerien forces in counter-insurgency operations. With some 800 US forces deployed in the country, \"our intent is to continue operations there,\" Dunford told a news conference. The October 4 clash, the deadliest US combat incident since President Donald Trump took office in January, has shocked many Americans unaware of the military presence in the African country, the largest US deployment on the continent. The four troops died on a reconnaissance patrol on the Niger-Mali border directly north of Niamey. Dunford said five Nigerien solders were killed, and another two Americans wounded. The 12 American and 30 Nigerien soldiers on the mission were attacked by about 50 fighters Dunford characterized as locals associated with the Islamic State group. Questions have been raised over why it took hours before backup support reached the patrol, and why one US soldier's body was left behind and only recovered the following day. 'Very complex situation' Dunford said the October 3-4 mission was originally approved based on an intelligence assessment that they were \"unlikely\" to come into conflict with any local forces. The unit went to a village near the border and was attacked as they returned to their base to the south. \nMyeshia Johnson kisses the casket of her husband, Army Sergeant La David Johnson, who was killed in the ambush (AFP/File) Dunford said that, based on what investigators know so far, the patrol did not call for support until one hour after first being attacked, suggesting perhaps they believed they could handle the situation. A surveillance drone was sent to the location quickly after they did call for support, and two French Mirage jets arrived overhead an hour later. But Dunford gave no details of what took place on the ground, and said he did not know, for example, why the French jets did not drop bombs. \"This is a very complex situation that they found themselves in,\" he noted. \"When they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgement would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support.\" The incident has drawn calls from Congress for an investigation into the US presence in Niger. A US special operations raid on Mogadishu in 1993 became a massive firefight leaving 19 US soldiers dead and resulted eventually in the pullback of US forces from Somalia . The 800 deployed in Niger are part of around 6,000 US forces on the continent, mostly there to train local partners. \"We mitigate the risk to the US forces with specific guidance that we will only accompany those (local) forces when the prospects of enemy contact is unlikely.\" Dunford said the Niger clash reflects the globalization of the fight against IS, even as it loses ground in Syria and Iraq.",

      "text": "Rusike signs ‘lucrative’ deal with Zanaco - 20 hours ago \nFORMER Caps United midfielder Tafadzwa “Fire” Rusike has signed a “lucrative” contract with Zambian Premier Soccer League champions Zanaco to replace Saith Sakala. \nBY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKA \nInformation obtained yesterday shows that Josphat Mhondiwa, a United Kingdom-based Zimbabwean agent who is chief executive officer of Joe Mart Sports and Events, was tasked by Zanaco management to look for Sakala’s replacement, after the attacker sealed a move to Al Fateh in Saudi Arabia. \nMhondiwa, according to information at hand, had recommended Ronald Chitiyo, Rusike and Donald Teguru of Ngezi Platinum. \nAt the time, Chitiyo had also attracted the attention of Arab teams before signing for a Tunisian club, which forced Zanaco to look for options elsewhere. \nThey then settled for Rusike, whose contract was terminated by Caps United in controversial circumstances last month. \n“Tafadzwa Rusike was always an option for us. We asked you to get him for us after you told us Chitiyo was on his way to Tunisia just before we finalise the transfer of your player Saith,” a Zanaco official on his recent conversation with Mhondiwa said. \nCoincidentally, Andrew Rusike (Tafadzwa’s uncle), who is also manager for both Tafadzwa and his former Caps United teammate Ronald Pfumbidzai, who is in constant touch with Joe Mart Sports and Events, alerted Mhondiwa of the recent developments with the player’s situation at Caps United. \nZanaco FC tasked Mhondiwa to facilitate Tafadzwa’s trip to Lusaka after which the player left last week, where he was expected to sign a contract on arrival. \nThe Zambian champions decided to go for Rusike after he impressed for Caps United in the Caf Champions League, and while he featured for the club in a friendly match last week, but they had already made up their mind on the talented left winger.",

      "text": "Ernest Mabuza 0 Comment \nThe High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday hear an application by President Jacob Zuma to set aside the remedial action by former public protector Thuli Madonsela on alleged state capture. \nMadonsela released a report‚ titled State of Capture‚ in November last year concerning allegations of an improper relationship between Zuma‚ other state officials and the Gupta family. \nThe report recommended that‚ because Madonsela did not have enough funds to finalise the investigation‚ Zuma appoint a commission of inquiry to complete the investigation. \nMadonsela recommended that the commission be established by Zuma but that the presiding judge should be chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. \nZuma took issue with the remedial action and applied to court to have it reviewed and set aside. \nZuma believes the public protector has no right to tell him who should appoint a judge to head up the inquiry. \nZuma also asked for an order sending the State of Capture report back to the public protector for further investigation. \nIn his application filed in December last year‚ Zuma said the remedial action was unlawful as it went against the separation of powers doctrine. \n“The Public Protector is directing remedial action in areas in which the Constitution has left to the Executive‚” Zuma said. \nZuma said Section 84(2)(f) of the constitution provided that the president of the country was responsible for “appointing commissions of inquiry”. \nZuma said the public protector did not have the power to direct the chief justice to select a judge to head the judicial inquiry. \n“Again‚ this power can only be exercised by a President.” \nThe public protector had said Zuma could not decide who should chair the commission because he has a direct personal interest in the inquiry’s outcome. \n“The Public Protector observed on numerous grounds that the President may have violated his obligations to avoid a conflict of interest under section 2.3 of the Executive Ethics Code.” \nMadonsela’s successor‚ Busisiwe Mkhwebane‚ said her office had observed that Zuma may not have acted in line with his duty of professional ethics. \n“Section 96 of the Constitution accordingly precludes the President from retaining control over the commission‚ as he is alleged to have a direct personal or financial interest in the outcome of the commission‚” Mkhwebane said in her affidavit.

By Sun Reporter Tuesday, October 24, 2017 08:49 ~ \nThe North Gauteng High Court is on Tuesday expected to hear President Jacob Zuma's application to review the remedial action contained in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. \nThe case has been set down for three days. \nNews24 previously reported that Zuma filed an application with the High Court to have Madonsela's report reviewed and set aside. \nHe said the former Public Protector had encroached on the role of the executive in her recommendations. \nMadonsela was looking into allegations of an improper relationship between the president and the influential Gupta family in relation to key appointments in Zuma's Cabinet and the awarding of contracts at state-owned enterprises. \nThe former Public Protector said she didn't have the necessary resources to finish her investigation into state capture and recommended a judicial inquiry, which was to be appointed by the President. \nHowever, she said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should be tasked with choosing a judge to head up the commission. \nDA federal chairperson James Selfe previously told News24 that the Nkandla judgment obliged Zuma to carry out remedial action unless it is set aside, and that was not done in this matter.",

PDP \nAsadu, who spoke in Nsukka, said All Progressives Congress, APC, will not win 10 percent of the votes in Enugu State in view of the hardship being experienced by Nigerians, especially Ndigbo, who were being punished for complaining about marginalisation. \nHe said Governor Ugwuanyi had, by his prudent management of resources, constructed roads as well as carried out other infrastructure development, even as civil servants were being promptly paid their salaries. \nOn the activities of his local government, Asadu said the greatest problem facing the council was payment of primary school teachers’ salaries and gully erosion, which had been wreaking havoc in the town. \nHe added that majority of the teachers earned from grade levels nine and 16, taking about 80 percent of all monthly allocations.",

      "text": "The consumer-facing sector has been pivotal to Africa's growth story, with McKinsey & Company estimating it accounted for almost 50% of GDP expansion between 2010 and 2014. But recent years have seen a combination of low commodity prices and droughts dampen the prospects of many countries, leading some to question whether the continent still holds promise for consumer brands. Keith Dilkes. One company with a good vantage point of the sector is Polyoak Packaging, a South African-based operator with a footprint in numerous markets across the continent. Polyoak produces rigid plastic packaging for a wide variety of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) items, including milk, dairy products, soft drinks and sauce condiments. How we made it in Africa recently sat down with Keith Dilkes , Africa export sales manager at Polyoak, to get his perspective on the trends impacting the consumer goods industry. Here are the main takeaways from the conversation.\n1. Products becoming more sophisticated\nThe region’s FMCG industry is growing in sophistication – especially when it comes to packaging.\nWhile this trend is partly driven by the growth of modern retailers (which don’t want yoghurt leaking from tubs all over their shelves), Dilkes says it is also encouraged by the younger members of established family-owned businesses.\n“East Africa specifically has numerous family-owned consumer-goods companies that have been trading for decades. Many of these businesses have become extremely successful and wealthy. The owners’ offspring are often sent overseas to study, and it is in these American, British and European markets where they are exposed to innovative, new packaging. When they return to the continent to rejoin the family enterprise, this next generation then looks at introducing these new ideas into their local markets,” explains Dilkes.\n2. Modern and informal retail to continue existing side by side\nInformal retail channels – such as markets, kiosks, table-top sellers and street hawkers – dominate sales in sub-Saharan Africa. The industry is, however, slowly modernising. The past decade has seen the development of numerous western-style shopping centres and the entry of international food and clothing chains.\nDilkes says that while retail is becoming more advanced, informal trade shouldn’t be ignored, as it remains the channel of choice for the majority of shoppers. “The wealthy would go there, but the local mass market typically still don’t shop at these big malls.”\nItems in modern shopping centres are usually priced at a premium, and are therefore unaffordable for many people. “Some segments are incredibly cost-conscious. They would steer away from value-added packaging in a bid to reduce cost wherever possible,” notes Dilkes.\nHe says that although disposable incomes are slowly rising, poverty remains widespread. For instance, in a country such as Malawi, over 70% of the population live on less than US$2 a day.\nDilkes also highlights the challenges faced by oil-dependent economies, such as Angola and Nigeria, which continue to struggle because of the drop in the price of crude oil from over $100 a barrel in mid-2014 to lows of less than $30 at the start of 2016.\n“Unfortunately, due to the wealth generated from the oil and gas during the good times, the farming and manufacturing sectors were completely ignored and neglected.”\n3. Local manufacturing sector growing\nThousands of containers of consumer goods still arrive at Africa’s ports every month. While the continent is likely to be a significant importer for the foreseeable future, Dilkes highlights growing momentum towards local production. For instance, both Zambia and Zimbabwe are large dairy producers, Ghana is becoming a significant fruit-juice maker, and Côte d’Ivoire is focusing on cocoa-based products and nuts.\nExisting FMCG producers are also expanding and diversifying their portfolios. “You might find a company that has done really well over the years with an ice-cream range, now decides to diversify into yoghurt or carbonated soft drinks, because it has already done most of the hard work – with refrigerated trucking and the successful listing of their product with the chain stores. So it really makes sense to expand their range,” explains Dilkes.\nHe gives the example of a Zambian company that started out by producing washing powder and then diversified into all sorts of consumer goods from biscuits to carbonated soft drinks. These type of businesses are also not frightened to spend money on advertising and promotion, which creates healthy competition with the majors that have dominated certain sectors over the years.\n4. Don’t write off Zimbabwe\nAsked to identify the countries with the greatest opportunities, Dilkes highlighted Zimbabwe as having high potential. This might come as a surprise to some, given Zimbabwe’s economic troubles. However, despite its current challenges, Dilkes is optimistic about the country’s long-term outlook. He also believes conditions in neighbouring Zambia, which has recently struggled with low copper prices and a drought, will improve.\nAnother country offering potential is Uganda, where Dilkes believes there are significant opportunities to commercialise and export its already substantial agricultural output. Similarly, Angola can exploit its vast tracts of fertile land and ample fresh water resources, to diversify the oil-dependent economy into farming and manufacturing. And despite pervasive poverty, Malawi also has strong potential, especially in terms of tourism.\nDilkes further singles out Ethiopia . “They recently inaugurated a new railway line from Addis Ababa to Djibouti, and Addis Ababa must be the only city in Africa with its own metro-line system. It is a vast country with a population of over 90 million and it’s already attracting the attention of the US as a possible new manufacturing market.”",

      "text": "Mohalenyane Phakela \nTHE producer of the world recognised film The Lost Cause has pleaded for investment in the local film industry to enable film producers and other players in the sector to tell Lesotho’s rich stories and thus sell the country to the rest of the world. \nUpcoming filmmaker, Lebohang Motlomelo, recently told Xpress People that having his zero budget film recognised overseas proves that Lesotho’s film industry has the potential to become a world-beater. \nThe Lost Cause garnered further international recognition when it was screened at the 8th Silicon Valley African Film Festival from 29 September to 1 October 2017 in Silicon Valley in the United States of America (USA). \nIt had already been screened at the Dieciminuti Film Festival (DFF) in Italy from 24 to 28 January this year, at the UK Screen One International Film Festival on 24 March and the Screen Test Student Film Festival in Chicago, USA on 22 April 2017. \nIt was voted the Best Student Film at the Lesotho Film Festival 2016 in November last year. \nThe film tells a story of lost love within a nation. It follows a young boy (Mosiuoa) who is left alone in the world filled with hatred when his brother (Ramonne) leaves for the liberation army camp four years after their father’s capture by the army. \nThe Silicon Valley African Film Festival was the first overseas screening which Motlomelo managed to attend after Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, Software24Seven and GEM Institute collaborated to sponsor his transport costs. \nMotlomelo – a Broadcasting and Journalism graduate from Limkokwing University in Maseru, said that although his film did not win, he was able to tell Lesotho’s story. \n“The Lost Cause was nominated for an award in the Short Narrative Category and even though it did not scoop the award, it was fortunate enough to be part of the building blocks in the growth of film industry in Lesotho,” Motlomelo said. \n“As a director, I received a Certificate of Recognition from the California State Assembly. I was also interviewed by two of the media practitioners, the Jason Dunford social media blog and African Technology Foundation and I shared my story with the people of the United States of America and the world at large.” \nHe said that taking his film to global markets indicated personal growth, adding it was “amusing and shocking at the same time for a zero budget film to stand toe to toe with some of the world’s top films. \nMotlomelo also said he realised there was a huge demand for Lesotho stories hence the need to support local film-makers to better sell Lesotho to other nations. \n“The festival provided enough space for networking with fellow Africans, and Americans towards creating opportunities and connecting communities for growth, business and human relationships. Among others, the Africa Video on Demand delegates gave a presentation on how they will to collaborate with African filmmakers in their film distribution portal. \n“During the festival, I met people who are eager to know about the tiny Mountain Kingdom and its mysteries, the stories of Basotho, their traditions and culture. \n“In Lesotho, the film industry is still in its infancy therefore there is a guaranteed chance of growth should there be support from government, the corporate sector and public in general. \n“The success of African cinema lies with African filmmakers but filmmakers cannot sustain the industry on their own. There is a dire need for support and investment for the industry to succeed,” he said.",

      "text": "Gerotek At present SA National Defence Force (SANDF) HQ is housed in the Armscor building in the Pretoria east suburb Erasmuskloof. The Defence Ministry and Defence Secretariat is also housed in there with DI currently in a Pretoria CBD building. The net effect would be, once the new Defence HQ, as stated in the annual report, is up and operational, that Armscor gains a tenant – DI – and will provide office space and other business facilities to existing clients – the SANDF and the Defence Ministry and Secretariat. No indication is given in the annual report as to whether the Ministry, Secretariat and DI will also eventually be housed at Gerotek, west of Pretoria just before Hartbeespoort Dam. The report does point out that “construction of a DI HQ building at Gerotek” is an activity it is focussing on. Another component of the Armscor financial turnaround and business re-orientation is a sustainability unit. Its role, according to the annual report, is to fast track exploitation of opportunities identified for revenue generation. “To this end engagement with various international and local stakeholders such as multi-national organisations, the SA defence industry and government departments have promoted Armscor services and follow-up on potential clients.” Progress made includes brokering the sale of military equipment (no equipment is named in the annual report) for Nigeria and Zambia. Another part of this wider revenue generation is increasing South African industry’s participation in UN procurement spend. “A Team SA approach was adopted, as the view is to support not just defence, but the wider South African industry and a multi-organisational approach to opportunities. This approach is flourishing as Armscor, CSIR and Denel visited the UN Headquarters in New York to widen South African Defence participation in UN Field support. In addition, 26 UN defence attaches (sic) of African countries were addressed on further relationships, and possible partnering opportunities are being explored. The Sustainability Unit is focused on building relationships with the local defence industry and other African nations,” according to the report.",

      "text": "41 minutes ago General Sun News 10 The Nigeria Basketball Federation has invited 16 players to camp for the FIBA Africa organized 3×3 championships to be held in Lome, Togo. The 3×3 men and women’s teams would be in camp for 8 days for the championship starting from the 1st of November. The Women’s team would be led by Nkechi Akashili and Chioma Udeaja both of First Bank Women Basketball Club of Lagos who were members of the 2017 Afrobasket women championship winning team in Mali. The list released on Monday also has Chidinma Deborah and Nkemuwa Akaraiwe of First Bank who were also part of the Afrobasket preparation. IGP Queens Basketball club duo of Grace Okonkwo and Christiana Isaac and Dolphins’ Roselyn Queen Ulabo as well as Josette Anaswem complete the list of invited players. For the men, eight players were drawn from Kano Pillars, Civil Defence, Rivers Hoopers and Kwara Falcons for the apex 3×3 basketball event in Africa. Yahaya Abdul, Azuoma Dike and Lucky Subel were invited from Pillars for the camping exercise, which would be held at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium, Lagos. Joel Ijigba of Civil Defence would be making his national team debut following an impressive season with Civil Defence if selected for the competition while the duo of River Hoopers of Port Harcourt players, Alalibo Owelem Ronald and Ebikoro Dennis Eteimowei and Kwara Falcons’ David Godwin complete the list of invited players for the men. The team will be coordinated by the Federal Capital Territory Basketball Chairman who is the Director of 3×3 Nigeria, Frank Jituboh. Fifa said the award was shortlisted with input from national team coaches, national team captains, media representatives and fans, with each group getting a one quarter weighting. “The process is clear and transparent and we are not involved in the final selection of nominees,” Fifa said in a statement. “However, we have taken note of the concerns raised by the football community and our fans and will take this feedback on board in future editions of The Best Awards.” But Rapinoe said football’s world governing body should have stepped in. “If some random male player, who was not even a full professional, was nominated, I’m sure they would step in for that, so it’s disappointing that the same hasn’t been done for us,” she said. Castellanos plays for the Florida State university team and had never represented Venezuela at senior or even under-20 level. She has 14 goals in 15 games so far for Florida State this season and six in nine for Santa Clarita Blue Heat – the Californian pro-am outfit she turned out for in the off-season. The awards recognise performances between November 2016 and August 2017, and the winner will be announced at a ceremony at the London Palladium on Monday evening. Conspicuous by their absence from the shortlist are players like Australia forward Sam Kerr, who became the all-time leading scorer in the National Women’s Soccer League in the United States, and England striker Jodie Taylor, who was top scorer at Euro 2017.",

      "text": "General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says the Pentagon plans a full investigation into the October 4 ambush in Niger. (GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP)   The United States will maintain its large military presence in Niger to assist local forces despite the deaths of four American soldiers in an ambush, the Pentagon's top officer said Monday. Nearly three weeks after jihadists attacked a joint US-Niger patrol in a sensitive border area, General Joseph Dunford , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the US is firmly committed to supporting Nigerien forces in counter-insurgency operations. With some 800 US forces deployed in the country, \"our intent is to continue operations there,\" Dunford told a news conference. The October 4 clash, the deadliest US combat incident since President Donald Trump took office in January, has shocked many Americans unaware of the military presence in the African country, the largest US deployment on the continent. The four troops died on a reconnaissance patrol on the Niger-Mali border directly north of Niamey. Dunford said five Nigerien solders were killed, and another two Americans wounded. The 12 American and 30 Nigerien soldiers on the mission were attacked by about 50 fighters Dunford characterized as locals associated with the Islamic State group. Questions have been raised over why it took hours before backup support reached the patrol, and why one US soldier's body was left behind and only recovered the following day. 'Very complex situation' Dunford said the October 3-4 mission was originally approved based on an intelligence assessment that they were \"unlikely\" to come into conflict with any local forces. The unit went to a village near the border and was attacked as they returned to their base to the south. \nMyeshia Johnson kisses the casket of her husband, Army Sergeant La David Johnson, who was killed in the ambush (AFP/File) Dunford said that, based on what investigators know so far, the patrol did not call for support until one hour after first being attacked, suggesting perhaps they believed they could handle the situation. A surveillance drone was sent to the location quickly after they did call for support, and two French Mirage jets arrived overhead an hour later. But Dunford gave no details of what took place on the ground, and said he did not know, for example, why the French jets did not drop bombs. \"This is a very complex situation that they found themselves in,\" he noted. \"When they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgement would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support.\" The incident has drawn calls from Congress for an investigation into the US presence in Niger. A US special operations raid on Mogadishu in 1993 became a massive firefight leaving 19 US soldiers dead and resulted eventually in the pullback of US forces from Somalia . The 800 deployed in Niger are part of around 6,000 US forces on the continent, mostly there to train local partners. \"We mitigate the risk to the US forces with specific guidance that we will only accompany those (local) forces when the prospects of enemy contact is unlikely.\" Dunford said the Niger clash reflects the globalization of the fight against IS, even as it loses ground in Syria and Iraq.",

      "text": "By John Fraser October 23, 2017 \nMike Whitfield is the head of Nissan in Southern Africa. The company has an auto plant at Rosslyn, near Pretoria, where The Cape Messenger’s Associate Editor John Fraser chatted to him. \nJF. What was your first car? \nMW. It was a Datsun 149Y GX Coupe. I think it was yellow, and I got it cheap because no-one wanted a yellow car. I have never owned any other brand, although I briefly drove an Alfa when we distributed them. \nJF. The government has an incentive support programme for the automotive industry. How has this programme worked? \nMW. We have had a consistent government programme in different iterations. A long-term policy is vital. Without it, we would be like Australia, where the last automotive plant closed this week. The auto industry in South Africa is a big exporter. Direct and indirect employment is close to 80 000, and that’s excluding the dealers. Without this consistent policy, we would not be here. Why build here, and ship the vehicles 12 000km north – unless there is good reason to do so? Now we must build on this policy – grow volumes, introduce more localisation and jobs. The motor industry brings skills and good, sustainable jobs. Not entry-level jobs. The current programme may not have delivered the one million units which were the target, but without it, what would we be building? We would be like Australia. \nJF. Do you accept the industry needs more BEE? \nMW. If we operate in this country, we must play within the rules of this country. We need better stakeholder engagement. However, we do not need to do this through equity. The industry has a responsibility to support empowerment through various mechanisms. One thing we share publicly is a venture fund to develop black-owned businesses, particularly from our supplier base. We want to drive localisation and employment. However, with a global multinational manufacturing operation, it is not always viable to have local equity. Personally, I am committed to support and implement solutions. \nJF. What is the attraction of Rosslyn? \nMW. We are here historically. If you were to build an auto plant today, it is guaranteed it would be at a port at the coast. The structure of the automotive industry is more export-based. Rosslyn was part of the old apartheid era, and this was an industrial zone, with the infrastructure to locate here. In the early 1960s, nobody thought we in South Africa would be a good exporter. \nJF. What then are the challenges with logistics? \nMW. The primary focus is transport by rail and road, with exports through Durban and Coega. It is a big challenge. Logistics plays a big role in making us competitive. We need more competitive port charges. \nJF. Do you enjoy driving? \nMW. I love it. But I don’t enjoy the traffic. \nJF. We already have electric cars. Are you surprised by the speed of change in your industry? \nMW. The pace of change from what we know today – in terms of intelligent mobility – is due to exponential growth of new technology. Not just petrol to electricity, but also autonomous driving. There are more collaborations between the OEMs (car giants) and IT businesses. We will see different ownership mechanisms, fractional ownership. Do you need to own a car? We still see Africa as the last frontier. The growth of the auto industry in SA will be through the expansion of the industry in sub-Saharan Africa. \nJF. You need to win investment in competition with other Nissan plants around the world. What are the challenges in winning investment for South Africa? \nMW. We operate in 40 to 50 countries in the world. They all have volatility and challenges, political and economic. We look for long-term stability and we understand the shorter spikes. We make investment decisions now for production to the end of 2020 to 2025. We look for more stability, and we understand the spikes. We are disappointed SA is not delivering on its potential. Today SA is the most attractive country in Africa for our type of investment. We look for stability and we do understand the short-term challenges. \nJF. What annoys you most about other drivers? \nMW. People sitting in the fast lane, using it to travel, instead of overtaking. \nJF. Which driving rule or regulation would you overturn? \nMW. A rule which needs to be applied more is dealing with people who are on their mobile phones while driving. This is a big contributor to road fatalities. The level of road fatalities in South Africa is totally inconceivable and unacceptable.",

      "text": "WHO’s Dr Tedros withdraws Robert Mugabe goodwill ambassador appointment It’s not so surprising WHO’s new director tried to make Robert Mugabe a goodwill ambassador Tedros: What a headache. (Reuters/Denis Balibouse) \n*Updated with news of withdrawal of appointment \nThe plan by World Health Organization (WHO) director-general to appoint Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador has backfired and been rescinded after an international outcry. \nSupporters and critics of the former Ethiopian health minister, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, aka Dr. Tedros, the first African to hold the WHO post , had taken to social media to express divergent interpretations. \n“@DrTedros is well intentioned and right to try get national leaders involved in the [non communicable disease] battle,” tweeted Mukesh Kapila, Professor of Global Health and Humanitarian Affairs at the University of Manchester. “Health for all require us to engage all -leaders – not only the ones like!” \n@DrTedros continues to engage world leaders to invest in health,” tweeted Senait Fisseha, a public health professor at the University of Michigan. Catherine Kyobutungi, executive director of the African Population and Health Research Center disagreed, tweeting : “If it’s about engaging all leaders, why of all places start with Robert Mugabe? This appointment diminishes the role of a goodwill ambassador. It is a meaningless gesture.” \nMugabe, 93, one of the longest serving leaders in the world, seems a particularly unusual appointment for goodwill ambassador, given his high profile as the leader of a government with a poor record of democratic freedoms. \nCritics were particularly offended at the idea that Mugabe was appointed because of his contributions to public health given the collapse of Zimbabwe’s healthcare system under his watch, along with the country’s economy in recent years. Mugabe, along with several others African leaders , has long trips abroad for medical treatment. \nTedros said he had “listened carefully” to all those who expressed concerns and “heard the different issues that they have raised. I have also consulted with the government of Zimbabwe and we have concluded that this decision is in the best interests of the World Health Organization.” Bad judgment \nWith questions about Dr. Tedros judgment in the first place, it’s worth pointing out this WHO D-G, as a former senior leader of an authoritarian Ethiopian government, will be more comfortable with someone with Mugabe’s reputation than any of his eight previous WHO predecessors. \n“Dr. Tedros uniquely stands out among the nine WHO D-Gs for his high-level position in a repressive government,” wrote Lawrence Gostin , the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on Public Health Law & Human Rights, in an op-ed in June. \nFor the better part of his career, Dr. Tedros has always drawn sharply divided opinions, both at home and internationally. “Dr. Tedros’s record reflects a contrast between high hopes and genuine concerns,” wrote Gostin. \n“As Health Minister, he transformed the Ethiopian health system,” he added. In fact, Tedros is widely credited with, among other things, creating an exceptional community health worker program and slashing child and maternal mortality rates by 60%. At the same time, the UN accused Ethiopia of covering up several outbreaks of cholera epidemics , under his stewardship as health minister from 2005 to 2012. \nWhile Tedros’ precise role or stance in these policies is not clear, it is a fact that he was not just a simple technocrat. For example, in 2010, he was ostensibly No. 3 in the executive leadership of the ruling Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front. That same year, the EPRDF won all but one of the 547 seats of legislature in general elections held in a context of repression. \nAs foreign minister from 2012 and 2016, Tedros became the face of a government that human rights groups accused of systematic torture, disappearances and repression of the media and civil society. In Ethiopia’s controversial 2015 general elections, Tedros’ ruling EPRDF declared that it won all 547 seats of legislature amid reports of continued repression.. \n“It would be unfair to blame Dr. Tedros for the Ethiopian government’s human rights abuses,” noted Gostin. \nIn fact, it is impossible to know whether Tedros was a voice of moderation within his government or how much of an impact his experience as a leader of an authoritarian government shaped his thinking. Notwithstanding, his desire to honor one of the world leaders most universally at odds with the values of WHO with an ambassadorship, albeit as a diplomatic engagement tactic, raises more questions than answers.",

      "text": "Kagame to be honored with World Tourism Award for Visionary Leadership   \nPresident Paul Kagame, will be honored with The World Tourism Award 2017 for Visionary Leadership on November 6, 2017, on the opening day of World Travel Market London, at the Excel Center. The World Tourism Award is “in recognition of HE Paul Kagame’s visionary leadership through a policy of reconciliation, sustainable tourism, wildlife conservation, and economic development attracting major hotel investment, resulting in the remarkable turnaround that has led to Rwanda’s rise as one of the leading tourism destinations in Africa today.” \nUnder President Kagame, Rwanda has achieved remarkable tourism success and has been established on the global stage as a leading sustainable tourism destination in Africa today. Tourism, Rwanda’s number one foreign exchange earner, has played a crucial role in the country’s development. Revenue from tourism has doubled from US$200 million in 2010 to US$404 million in 2016 indicating an annual average increase of 10%, surpassing the National Export Strategy II target in 2016 by 13%. Over 1.3 million tourists visited Rwanda in 2016. Visitor arrivals for the same period (2010-2016) have increased by 12% annually against a backdrop of UNWTO arrivals in global emerging markets bench-marked at 3.3% for the same period. The tourism sector in Rwanda is expected to grow at 15% per annum. - Advertisement - \nAs a preferred investment destination, Rwanda has instituted several initiatives to ensure a conducive environment for business. To date, Rwanda is considered as the 2nd competitive destination for business in Africa according the 2017 WEF Global Competitiveness Report, and this has encouraged even more foreign investment in the tourism sector. Prioritizing infrastructure development within the travel and tourism sector with over $1Billion invested into significant contributors such as RwandAir, enabling it to expand its routes globally to 23 destinations as well as increase its airlift capacity with two new A330 Airbus aircraft. The next major development in this sector is the commencement of the new international Bugesera Airport. The construction of Kigali Convention Center now positions Rwanda as an international conference and meetings destination. \nThe addition of over 1,600 international brands four and five-star lodge and hotel rooms, including Marriott, Radisson Blu, Bisate by Wilderness Safaris and One & Only Nyungwe House, Ubumwe Grande that has been acquired by Double Tree by Hilton has resulted in the creation of over 90,000 jobs in the overall hospitality industry. \nSustainability is critical to a sound tourism policy and Rwanda has ensured that 10% of all tourism revenue is given back to the communities surrounding the Country’s four national parks. This money is used to fund local priority projects such as schools, health centers and business that promote sustainability benefiting thousands of Rwandans. Rwanda’s Conservation efforts have made a major impact on the growth of the world-renowned mountain gorilla population by 26.3% since the last census in 2010. The Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda is now home to 305 mountain gorillas which accounts for more than half the population in the Virunga Massif.……eTurboNews",

      "text": "Petroleum sector codes to promote transformation Energy / 24 October 2017, 11:00am / Thembelihle Mkhonza Energy Minister David Mahlobo File photo: INLSA JOHANNESBURG - Energy Minister David Mahlobo said government was working on petroleum sector codes to promote transformation in the industry. Addressing the Africa Oil and Gas Week Conference, which was held in Cape Town on Monday, Minister Mahlobo said the work being done is meant to ensure the meaningful participation of the disadvantaged sections of South Africa’s society. “We have to work together towards a radically transformed and inclusive economy. “This is a non-negotiable in our context and includes emphasis on skills transfer and enterprise development to create additional opportunities for transformation and empowerment in the country, the regions and the continent as a whole,” Mahlobo said. He said the sustainability of the country’s environment is key. South Africa has set ambitious carbon reduction targets. “Sustainability of energy supply therefore needs to include a diversified energy mix that uses the most efficient primary energy resource for each application or energy service rendered,” Mahlobo said. Government is already seeking ways and new technologies to use fossil fuels with minimal carbon emissions, in line with the country’s climate change commitments. “South Africa recognises the role of nuclear power in ensuring security of energy supply and meeting the challenge of climate change. We promote an energy mix of coal, gas, renewables and nuclear,” he said. Mahlobo said each of the options has their role -- some of the energy sources are intermittent supply, while others, such as nuclear and coal, are base-load supply. “Our primary policy instrument in this regard is the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which details our proposed energy mix and interventions over a 20-year period,” Mahlobo said. According to the Minister, the IRP Review is currently underway and the finalisation of the policy is expected soon.

We are implementing our energy mix policy by having 30% of clean energy by 2025,” he said. Minister Mahlobo said the multifaceted nature of the energy policy requires for factors such as economic, social and environmental concerns to be considered in energy planning. “There are therefore different sets of variables that inform energy planning nationally, regionally and globally and there cannot be a one-source fits all approach. “As demonstrated by our renewable energy programme, we are committed to transition to a low-carbon economy, with priority to be given to clean energy alternatives, subject to current technological and cost constraints,” Mahlobo said. -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE",

      "text": "Bianca Capazorio 0 Comment \nFinance minister’s first budget speech must address challenges and inspire confidence – DA \nTomorrow’s medium-term budget policy statement will be a defining moment for Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, who is not trusted by the markets‚ the DA said. \nDA spokesman on finance David Maynier said at a pre-budget media conference yesterday that Gigaba’s maiden budget speech would need to inspire confidence in investors and South Africans alike. \nHowever, he believed the minister had very little political space in which to manoeuvre. \nMaynier said Gigaba would need to tackle five big challenges in his statement‚ among them weak economic growth – which he believes will be revised down to about 0.6% for the year from a February forecast of 1.3% – and fiscal slippage which will see the fiscal deficit increase and revenue fall. \nHe projects a revenue shortfall of about R56-billion for the 2017-18 year. \nSMS YOUR VIEWS \nTO 32187 SMSes are charged at R1 per 160 characters. Free SMSes do not apply. Errors will be billed. \nMaynier said the minister should also focus on institutional vulnerability, with the autonomy of the Reserve Bank‚ the Public Investment Corporation and the Treasury all currently under threat. \nGigaba, who was not trusted‚ especially by the markets, needed to make a strong and unequivocal statement to the state capturers that he supported the independence of the Reserve Bank‚ PIC and Treasury, he said. \nThe fourth area of focus should be what DA deputy spokesman on finance Alf Lees termed zombiestate-owned enterprises, such as huge-loss-generating South African Airways. \nLees said that the finance minister would have no option but to provide for both an emergency bailout of SAA‚ totalling R5.2-billion, and a further R4.8-billion for working capital in the adjustments budget. \nThe fifth area of concern was long-term fiscal risks, such as the nuclear plan. \nMaynier said a Sunday Times report at the weekend that new Energy Minister David Mahlobo was appointed after a warning from the Russians to push the project through, “signals an intention to accelerate the programme‚ which is terrifying”. \nMahlobo made his maiden speech as energy minister at the Africa oil and gas conference in Cape Town last week, saying: “South Africa recognises the role of nuclear power in ensuring security of energy supply and meeting the challenge of climate change. \n“We promote an energy mix of coal‚ gas‚ renewables and nuclear. \n“Each of these options has their role: some of the energy sources are intermittent supply while others‚ such as nuclear and coal‚ are base-load supply.”. – TimesLIVE Related",

The initiative, which is led by Audi, Cricket South Africa (CSA) and former Proteas quick and development guru, Mfuneko Ngam, is the first designed to utilise state-of-the-art technology to unearth the hidden gems of South African fast blowing. \nIt is currently taking place around the country and identifies a number of talented local young bowlers who will be given the chance to prove themselves in front of CSA’s development structures. \nLead talent scout, Mfuneko Ngam, said, “Our first events in Gauteng and Eastern Cape were resounding successes and this was no different. I have been very impressed by the level of talent we have uncovered so far. We are very excited at the prospect of one of these young bowlers following in the footsteps of the great Proteas bowlers who came before them.” \nOn the day, local bowlers between the ages of 15 and 18 were given the opportunity to showcase their talent in front of a powerful development team. \nBowlers were given the chance to illustrate their skills in the nets with the most promising selected to have their bowling measured on the Audi Bowling Lab – a set-up which utilises state-of-the-art PitchVision technology to instantly analyse a bowler’s performance by comparing pace, line, length, deviation and bounce to that of a current Proteas bowler. \nNgam and his team, which included CSA representatives and local coaches, utilised the scoring system of the Audi Bowling Lab to select the talented boys and girls who will now be put in front of CSA development structures. \nTrevor Hill, head of Audi South Africa, said, “Today continued our search for standout fast bowlers and Durban did not disappoint. As progressive partner to the Proteas, Audi is proud to be able to take our partnership with CSA to the next level by driving progress in a development space. The prospect of potentially uncovering the next Ntini or Ngam, together with CSA, is something we are not only excited by but which we are striving towards.” SHARE",

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Clearance Munondo Entertainment Hillary Makaya \nSenior Arts Reporter This year’s winner for Miss Intercontinental Zimbabwe 2017-2018 is Hillary Makaya. The 18-year-old beauty queen walked away with the coveted title after beating other 23 girls over the weekend. She is set to represent the country at this year’s Miss Intercontinental World in Panama in December. The pageant which is in its 46th edition will see more than 80 contestants from across the world vying for the coveted title. Makaya, who earlier this won the Miss Teen Heritage World said, she was ready to take the world stage by storm. \n“I think this is my year. I was shocked at the same time excited that I am again going to represent the country in Panama. I am honoured for this privilege. This is my second best pageant and I believe I will bring the crown home. Posh will be dressing me for the finale,” she said. The lanky model is set to leave for Panama on December 7 ahead of the boot camp. \n“I will start putting some action into my projects on November 19. Now I am busy writing my advanced level examinations. I would like to start my foundation, ‘The Hillary Makaya Foundation’, whose focus would be helping the children of Zimbabwe. We have set plans in place that will see the foundation help shape the lives of the underprivileged children. This is an open window for me to inspire, import and be a role model of the children in my country,” she said. Asked, how she will market Zimbabwe in Panama, Makaya said she will use the same modus operandi. \n“Remember, I am not new to this, I will use the same concept I did in Sri Lanka, and it’s just that different country though. I will focus on promoting our tourist destinations and tell them about our beautiful culture. I will make sure I had visited some of the important destinations and understand them better before I leave. I am glad I have support from family and will continue with my grooming classes,” she said. Last year award winner model Hilda Mabu made the nation proud when she made it in the top 15 at Miss Intercontinental World.",

FILE PHOTO | NMG In Summary The UN Security Council imposed travel bans and asset freezes on the military commanders – three from each side – for human rights violations and blocking the implementation of the peace agreement in the war-torn country. In a circular dated October 10, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) directed banks’ chief executives to give a detailed report on accounts operated by the six generals as well as on assets they own or control directly or indirectly through other persons. Advertisement More by this Author \nKenya’s central bank has instructed commercial banks to freeze accounts of six top South Sudanese generals in line with UN sanctions against them. \nThe UN Security Council imposed travel bans and asset freezes on the military commanders – three from each side – for human rights violations and blocking the implementation of the peace agreement in the war-torn country. \nThey include General Santino Deng, General Gabriel Jok Riak, and General Chanuong Yol Mangok from the government Sudan Peoples’ Liberation Army (SPLA); and General James Koang, General Simon Gatwech Dual, and General Peter Gatdet from the opposition SPLA-In Opposition (SPLA-IO). \nIn a circular dated October 10, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) directed banks’ chief executives to give a detailed report on accounts operated by the six generals as well as on assets they own or control directly or indirectly through other persons. \n“Report to CBK by November 5, on steps taken to implement UNSCR 2206 of 2015 as read together with the successor resolutions UNSCR 2290 of 2016 and UNSCR 2353 of 2017,” the banking regulator's directive said. \nThe UN sanctions were first imposed in 2015 and renewed in 2016 and 2017 to continue till May 31, 2018. \nKenyan banks have been cited in reports for allowing transactions of million of dollars looted from the war-torn country.",

One, for leaving the service without permission; he ran away from the country. And two, for the embarrassment he has brought to the government,” Adesina said, on Monday.",

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, has appealed to the Federal Government to hand over federal roads in the country to the state governments for effective management so as to ensure long term viability. He made the appeal when he received the Senate Committee on Works led by its Chairman, Senator Kabiru Gaya , at the Government House in Sokoto late on Monday, October 23, 2017. \"There is the need for the federal government to hand over the roads to states because state governments are closer to the people and we have more efficient methods of supervision. \"If this is done, it will go a long way in ensuring that the vast majority of major roads and highways in the country are well maintained,\" he said. Tambuwal said Sokoto State government will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that the infrastructural development of Nigeria is given utmost attention. He equally solicited the support of the National Assembly to facilitate the reimbursement of the money the state government spent on the repairs of some federal roads in its domain. In his remarks, Senator Gaya said they were in the state for the conduct of their oversight functions. He lauded Tambuwal's efforts especially in the area of infrastructural development. ALSO READ: Sokoto government to construct N2.8 billion water schemes Senator Gaya also assured that his committee will facilitate the reimbursement of the funds used by the state government in the repairs of federal roads. He particularly thanked Governor Tambuwal for his commitment to see to the completion of the Sokoto-Jega-Yauri-Kontagora road which is currently under construction.

      "text": "#StateCapture: Mkhwebane has no power to instruct Zuma, says lawyer Gauteng / 24 October 2017, 12:42pm / ZELDA VENTER Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is opposing President Jacob Zuma’s application of a judicial review of the state capture findings. Picture: Mike Hutchings/Reuters \nPretoria - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is opposing President Jacob Zuma’s application of a judicial review of the state capture findings and will argue that in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, he has a duty to adhere to the remedial action required in the State of Capture report. \nPublic Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said she will bring a counter application - if the court ruled in Zuma's favour - that her office be placed in funds to take the investigation into state capture further. \nZuma is asking the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, to set aside former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's findings that a commission of inquiry must be set up. \nThe report was released in November last year, following an unsuccessful legal bid by the president to block its release. \nMadonsela said in her report that Zuma had to set up a judicial commission of inquiry into the findings of the State of Capture Report, but that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng had to appoint a judge to head the commission. \nZuma was given 30 days to appoint the commission, which had lapsed in December. \nTen months later the commission was still not appointed and the Democratic Alliance last month asked for a court order compelling Zuma to immediately establish a judicial commission of inquiry. \nBut Zuma’s camp argued that in light of his pending review application of the State of Capture Report he was under no obligation to set up the inquiry at this stage. \nThe court agreed and gave Zuma a lifeline pending the outcome of this week’s review proceedings. \nJudge M A Makume earlier said the DA has failed to demonstrate what prejudice or harm it will suffer if the president does not appoint a commission of inquiry now. \n“Nothing has happened in the last 10 months. It will therefore not make any difference if the commission is appointed after the review shall have been heard, should the president fail in his application to set aside the remedial action,\" the judge said. \nKicking off Tuesday's application by Zuma, Advocate Ishmail Semenya, acting for Zuma, argued at length that Madonsela did not have the power to instruct the president to appoint a commission and to instruct him to exercise his power through the chief justice. The power to appoint a commission on inquiry is that of the president, he argued. \nSemenya said the Public Protector is an organ of State and limited by the separation of powers. He said the remedial action she called for is thus invalid. \nHe said the Constitution and the Public Protectors Act confers the powers on the public protector to investigate any conduct in the state's affairs that is suspected to be improper, to report on it and to take appropriate remedial action. \nHe said in this case the public protector is outsourcing her powers to a commission of inquiry to take her investigation further due to a lack of resources. \nBut according to Semenya, a commission of inquiry cannot do this. He said Zuma in any event in Parliament said he will appoint a commission on his own time to investigate all the Gupta related issues and not only the recommendations made in the State of Capture report. \nJudge President Dunstan Mlambo questioned Semenya on how the public must view the fact that he had done nothing about it up to now. \nMlambo said Zuma knew from April last year that the Public Protector was investigating complaints brought against him and organs of state regarding their alleged relationship with the Gupta family. \nIn October last year, after a brief meeting with Madonsela, he brought an application to halt the issuing of the report. Mlambo said we are now 18 months down the line and still Zuma had done nothing about the allegations. \n\"Serious allegations of state capture were levelled against him. He did nothing other than tell parliament he will institute a commission. Is this what one can expect from a reasonable president in a democracy,\" the judge asked. \nSemenya responded that this avenue was not open to him until he had reviewed and set aside the report. \" He was legally incapable of doing so until the review is heard,\" Semenya said.",

      "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commsion, EFCC, has sealed all the properties belonging to embattled ex-chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Pension Reforms, Abdulrasheed Maina. \nMaina, who has been accused of complicity in N2bn fraud, has reportedly gone into hiding. \nThe civil servant was declared wanted by the EFCC in November 2015 for alleged fraud. \nHowever, Maina surprisingly resurfaced this month as an acting director in the Ministry of Interior, a development that triggered a nationwide uproar, forcing president Buhari to order for his immediate disengagement from service. \nThe EFCC Spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, while speaking on the issue on Monday, said the commission was still on his trail. \nHe, however, stated that the commission had marked his houses in Abuja, including a house in Jabi said to be worth about $2m. \nUwujaren told Punch, “Yes, his properties were marked today. To the best of my knowledge, he has not yet been arrested.” \nAnother source within the anti-graft agency was quoted as saying that Maina was moving around town in a bulletproof Range Rover Sports Utility Vehicle and other expensive vehicles. \nThe source said, “We have traced him to a hotel in Kaduna where he went to spend the weekend; we know that the DSS is protecting him and the DG DSS, deployed men to protect him. But make no mistake, we will arrest him, already we’ve frozen all his accounts.” \n“He stays in a property which is a DSS safe house. He moves around in a convoy of about two or three vehicles. I personally saw him alighting from a Range Rover SUV last week with about four DSS officials.”",

      "text": "Dollar Climbs to Three-month High, Adds 0.25% Dollar Climbs to Three-month High, Adds 0.25% - October 24, 2017 0 \nThe United States of America dollar touched a three-month high against the yen on Monday, October 23, with an emphatic election victory for Japan’s ruling party keeping yen-weakening stimulus measures at the heart of government policy. \nThe greenback had already gained about 0.9 percent on Friday after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, clearing a critical hurdle for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support. \nThe dollar was supported as U.S. yields rose, with the two-year yield hitting a nine-year high, as the progress in tax reforms boosted expectations of increased U.S. Government borrowing and a possible pickup in inflation. \nThe greenback had already gained about 0.9 percent on Friday after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, clearing a critical hurdle for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support. \nThe U.S. currency was up 0.25 percent at 113.79 JPY=, losing a bit of momentum after earlier touching 114.10, its highest since July 11. \nThe dollar was supported as U.S. yields rose, with the two-year yield hitting a nine-year high, as the progress in tax reforms boosted expectations of increased U.S. Government borrowing and a possible pickup in inflation. \nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling party scored a big win in Sunday’s election with his coalition keeping its two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house, local media said. \nAbe’s victory eased fears that the economic steps implemented under his leadership – such as the Bank of Japan’s super easy monetary policy – would be disrupted and halt the yen’s depreciation against the dollar. \n“An LDP win did not come as a surprise, but it still helped clear uncertainty that had been preventing participants from buying the dollar,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. \n“Overcoming deflation with the BOJ easing is at the crux of the Abe administration’s policies and this will now be allowed to continue indefinitely. It’s relief over the BOJ policies, rather than hopes for fresh fiscal stimulus, that is weakening the yen.” \nMasashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo, said dollar/yen-supportive election elation was likely to peter out relatively quickly, with market focus returning to U.S. factors like tax reform efforts. \n“The election outcome means the Abe administration will retain the status quo, making no changes, and continue with its policies,” Murata said. “It will find little need for fresh steps when the GDP has registered six quarters of growth, unemployment is under 3 percent and the Nikkei is above 21,000.” \nAnother focal point for the dollar was who U.S. President Donald Trump would appoint as the next Federal Reserve chief. Investors are hoping whoever is nominated pursues the same monetary policy that has supported rising stock prices for the past nine years. \nThe euro was 0.15 percent lower at $1.1769 EUR=, extending losses from Friday when it lost 0.6 percent. \nThe common currency has drifted lower from a 2-1/2-year peak of $1.2092 scaled on Sept. 8, as hopes for the European Central Bank to take a more hawkish stance have been tempered by speculation that it is not be in a hurry to taper its easy policy. \nThe ECB holds a policy meeting on Thursday, at which policymakers are seen cutting bond purchases but voting for an extension in stimulus. \nThe political situation in Europe has also been a drag for the euro, with the Spanish government having taken desperate steps over the weekend to thwart Catalonia’s bid for independence. \nAccording to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, speculators trimmed their net long euro positions in the week to Oct. 17 to $13.303 billion from the previous week’s $14.474 billion, which was the highest since 2011. \nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose to 93.872, its highest since Oct. 6, before pulling back to 93.767, up 0.05 percent on the day. \nThe New Zealand dollar, battered last week by a change in government, slipped to a five-month low of $0.6932 NZD=D4 against the broadly stronger U.S. currency and last traded at $0.6964. The kiwi shed about 3 percent last week.",

      "text": "Ernest Mabuza 0 Comment \nThe High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday hear an application by President Jacob Zuma to set aside the remedial action by former public protector Thuli Madonsela on alleged state capture. \nMadonsela released a report‚ titled State of Capture‚ in November last year concerning allegations of an improper relationship between Zuma‚ other state officials and the Gupta family. \nThe report recommended that‚ because Madonsela did not have enough funds to finalise the investigation‚ Zuma appoint a commission of inquiry to complete the investigation. \nMadonsela recommended that the commission be established by Zuma but that the presiding judge should be chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. \nZuma took issue with the remedial action and applied to court to have it reviewed and set aside. \nZuma believes the public protector has no right to tell him who should appoint a judge to head up the inquiry. \nZuma also asked for an order sending the State of Capture report back to the public protector for further investigation. \nIn his application filed in December last year‚ Zuma said the remedial action was unlawful as it went against the separation of powers doctrine. \n“The Public Protector is directing remedial action in areas in which the Constitution has left to the Executive‚” Zuma said. \nZuma said Section 84(2)(f) of the constitution provided that the president of the country was responsible for “appointing commissions of inquiry”. \nZuma said the public protector did not have the power to direct the chief justice to select a judge to head the judicial inquiry. \n“Again‚ this power can only be exercised by a President.” \nThe public protector had said Zuma could not decide who should chair the commission because he has a direct personal interest in the inquiry’s outcome. \n“The Public Protector observed on numerous grounds that the President may have violated his obligations to avoid a conflict of interest under section 2.3 of the Executive Ethics Code.” \nMadonsela’s successor‚ Busisiwe Mkhwebane‚ said her office had observed that Zuma may not have acted in line with his duty of professional ethics. \n“Section 96 of the Constitution accordingly precludes the President from retaining control over the commission‚ as he is alleged to have a direct personal or financial interest in the outcome of the commission‚” Mkhwebane said in her affidavit.

By Sun Reporter Tuesday, October 24, 2017 08:49 ~ \nThe North Gauteng High Court is on Tuesday expected to hear President Jacob Zuma's application to review the remedial action contained in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. \nThe case has been set down for three days. \nNews24 previously reported that Zuma filed an application with the High Court to have Madonsela's report reviewed and set aside. \nHe said the former Public Protector had encroached on the role of the executive in her recommendations. \nMadonsela was looking into allegations of an improper relationship between the president and the influential Gupta family in relation to key appointments in Zuma's Cabinet and the awarding of contracts at state-owned enterprises. \nThe former Public Protector said she didn't have the necessary resources to finish her investigation into state capture and recommended a judicial inquiry, which was to be appointed by the President. \nHowever, she said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should be tasked with choosing a judge to head up the commission. \nDA federal chairperson James Selfe previously told News24 that the Nkandla judgment obliged Zuma to carry out remedial action unless it is set aside, and that was not done in this matter.",

Justice Abang was said to have signed the subpoena later on Monday. Jonathan is expected to appear before the court on Wednesday, October 25, 2017. \"I can authoritatively tell you that Metuh’s legal team filed the subpoena before the judge on Monday and the judge signed the subpoena promptly after the proceedings on Monday,\" a source told Punch. \"The judge indicated in the subpoena that the former President should appear in court on Wednesday. \"But whether or not the former President would appear in court on Wednesday would be dependent on if the court bailiff will be able to serve him at his home in Abuja between Monday and the end of Tuesday.\" Metuh is being tried over the 'shady' N400 million he received from the Office of the National Security Adviser in November 2014. ALSO READ : PDP says he’ll return N400M to show support for anti-corruption war It is believed that the money is part of the $2 billion arms deal, which the then NSA, Sambo Dasuki , alleged shared among PDP chieftains to fund Jonathan's presidential campaign in 2015. Most of Metuh's defence witnesses, including Mr. Ben Nwosu , who ended his testimony earlier on Monday, had insisted that the N400 million was directly authorised by Jonathan.

      "host": "mg.co.za",
      "text": "University of Cape Town (UCT) vice-chancellor Max Price has expressed “grave concern” that President Jacob Zuma has not yet released the fees commission report.\nA statement from UCT appealing for the release of the report came late on Monday following the shutdown of the university’s main library by a group of protesters.\nThe statement is the first direct public message to Zuma from a university that presses for the fees report to be released amid deepening fears that campuses and families are unable to sufficiently prepare their finances for the 2018 academic year.\nUCT said it would normally have finished consultations on fees with its student representative council (SRC) in September, but has been unable to do so without the instructions of the fees report.\n“However, not wanting to pre-empt the recommendations of the fees commission we have delayed decisions on fees pending the release of the report,” said Price.\nZuma established the Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training (fees commission) in January 2016. The commission was tasked with investigating the feasibility of free education in South Africa. Its report landed on Zuma’s desk on August 31, and had since been shrouded in secrecy.\nIn the past two months, many universities have been left to wait, sweating out the looming stress as many have resolved they cannot plan their 2018 budget without knowing what the report will say.\nIn Cape Town, Stellenbosch University has been unable to wait. It has announced an 8% fee increase for the 2018 year. But its SRC has rejected that increase , saying it will exclude poor black students.\nThe University of the Free State (UFS) has already been shutdown by student protesters, but resolving fees disputes may be difficult without the report or any feedback from the government on the next year. By this time last year, the higher education ministry had already told universities about the government’s higher education budget for the next academic year.\nThe University of Witwatersrand (Wits) is meanwhile trying to plan its own finances, but told the Mail & Guardian : “[It’s] not meaningful without knowledge of the recommendations of the report”.\nThe instability in the higher education ministry may now be exacerbated by Zuma’s surprise Cabinet reshuffle 7 days ago, which saw higher education minister Blade Nzimande axed. Nzimande’s removal came at a time when universities would ordinarily financially prepare for the year ahead as the academic year comes to a close.\nIn an interview with City Press , the former minister said not even he had seen Zuma’s tightly held fees commission report before he was sacked. He said his removal as higher education minister paved the way for Zuma to credit someone else for the report.\n“I thought that it would be obvious that he will call me and say: ‘Here is the report. What are your views on it before I respond?’ The president never gave me the report. I don’t know about it,” he said.\nPrice’s statement squarely puts the blame on government if university finances should go awry in the coming months or year. Already, he said, UCT is underfunded and its student body and parents will need to know what the next year will hold.\n“We will not be able to delay decisions on fees for much longer. We, therefore, appeal to the President to release the report for public scrutiny and debate,” he said.\nRa'eesa Pather Ra’eesa Pather is a general news journalist with the Mail & Guardian’s online team.

A court on Monday refused to grant her bail in a case in which she has been charged with inciting insurrection against the state and other offences. PHOTO | CYRIL NDEGEYA | AFP In Summary Rwigara is the daughter of Assinapol Rwigara, an entrepreneur who made a fortune in industry and real estate, and a main backer of Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front during its efforts to topple the Hutu extremist regime in 1994, ending the Rwandan genocide. Diane Rwigara later distanced herself from the FPR after her father's death in a car crash in 2015, which she has claimed was an \"assassination\". Advertisement More by this Author KIGALI A Rwandan court on Monday refused to grant bail to Diane Rwigara, a prominent critic of President Paul Kagame who has been charged with inciting insurrection against the state as well as other offences. Rwigara was blocked from challenging Kagame in August's presidential election and arrested on September 22, along with her mother and sister, for alleged tax evasion and forgery as well as for inciting insurrection. Her mother Adeline was also refused bail on similar charges by the court in the capital Kigali, but charges against his sister Diane were lifted and she was released from custody. PERSECUTION In an interview just before her detention last month, Rwigara, 35, said she was a victim of political persecution \"for standing against oppression and speaking my mind.\" Other critics and opposition figures have also been detained in recent weeks in what observers say is a post-election crackdown on dissent. The refusal to allow her to run against Kagame, who won the August 4 election with 99 percent of the vote, on claims of procedural irregularities was widely criticised by Western governments and rights groups. The court on Monday spoke of the \"sensitivity\" of the case, adding that Rwigara and her mother could flee the country if they were released. Insurrection carries a possible 15-year prison term. Rwigara is the daughter of Assinapol Rwigara, an entrepreneur who made a fortune in industry and real estate, and a main backer of Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) during its efforts to topple the Hutu extremist regime in 1994, ending the Rwandan genocide. Diane Rwigara later distanced herself from the FPR after her father's death in a car crash in 2015, which she has claimed was an \"assassination\". In the headlines",

      "text": "You are here » Home » Opinion Why those prescribing ‘boardroom’ democracy for us are dead wrong By Kipchumba Murkomen | Published Mon, October 23rd 2017 at 09:52, Updated October 23rd 2017 at 09:56 GMT +3 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share on Twitter \nThere has recently been a chorus of calls by sections of the diplomatic missions in Kenya who have variously been quoted asking President Uhuru Kenya to negotiate the issue of the Kenyan presidency with the NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and reach a settlement. \nThe President would be ill-advised to succumb to such reckless calls as they would not only be contemptuous of the Supreme Court of Kenya that ruled on Presidential Election Petition Number 1 of 2017 that ordered the IEBC to conduct a fresh Presidential Election in strict conformity with the Constitution and the applicable election laws within 60 days of the determination, but it would also offend Article 136 of the constitution of Kenya 2010 that requires the President to be elected by registered voters in a national election conducted in accordance with the Constitution and any Act of Parliament regulating presidential elections. \nALSO READ: Exhortation to rise against second-rate democracy in Kenya \nSovereignty \nThe supreme law of Kenya underlines the sovereignty of the Kenyan voter to choose his leaders through a clearly defined electoral process. Neither the Constitution of Kenya 2010 nor any Acts of Parliament regulating presidential elections in Kenya have any provisions that provide for ‘negotiations’ as an alternative method to be used for choosing the holder of the office of President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya. \nThere have also not been any amendments to our statutes that have replaced the Kenyan voter, being the legally prescribed appointing authority, with ‘Foreign Diplomats’, ‘NASA Principals’ or ‘Jubilee Party Negotiators’ thereby according them powers to appoint the President through negotiations. In my considered view, it would actually require a referendum as stipulated in Article 255(1)(c) of the constitution of Kenya 2010 to remove the right of the Kenyan Voter to exercise his sovereign right to choose his leaders and confer such right to a team of negotiators. It is inconceivable that the voters would vote themselves out of such a right. \nLegally enlightened \nIt should also be noted that Kenyans have become very legally enlightened with heightened awareness of their rights and any attempts to appoint a President or Prime Minister through negotiation or any other processes outside the provisions of the constitution would be met with fast and furious litigation and wouldn’t see the light of day. The path therefore of negotiated or boardroom democracy that our foreign friends are leading us towards constitutes an illegality that is not only dangerous but does not conform to the rule of law. \nDangerous trend \nThis prescription of ‘boardroom democracy’ is not good for our country. It is giving rise to a very dangerous trend that if left unchecked and allowed to take root in Kenya will surely replace democracy or majoritarian rule as we know it today. It is a trend akin to ‘Tyranny of the Minority’ whereby a losing presidential candidate and his minority reject the election results using violence, mass action, bedlam and chaos to such a scale that threatens the very fabric of the state making it ungovernable and holding the majority ransom in a deadlock that they only purpose to unlock through negotiated democracy resulting into their accommodation in government. The country then ends up getting the leaders they did not vote into office thereby desecrating our democracy. \nHistory repeating itself? \nALSO READ: What Supreme Court ruling means for future \nThe chaos is often carefully designed, planned and choreographed to quickly degenerate into a humanitarian and economic crisis that immediately attracts the attention of the international community, civil society and even the majority to seek a short term solution to put out intentionally lit fires to enable the country to move on. \nThis is a game that the NASA Principals understand very well having been its beneficiaries in 2007 when both Raila, Kalonzo, Wetangula and Mudavadi were all beneficiaries of the 2008-2013 Nusu-Mkate government which richly gifted them with the last jobs they ever held in government. Raila became Prime Minister and enjoyed all the trappings of a co-presidency. \nKalonzo was named Vice President by then President Kibaki to shore up PNU numbers while Musalia Mudavadi was appointed to the plum position of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Local Government. Moses Wetangula was appointed Minister for Foreign affairs as a reward for his role in the PNU negotiation panel. Those were surely the nostalgic good all days that the quartet would wish to relive at the expense of our democracy. \nBut my greatest misgiving with this prescription is that; There would be no need for us to go to elections if such elections do not result in respect for the choice and decision of the electorate. \nGullible international community \nThat despite being rejected by the electorate, a losing candidate can marshal his supporters and make enough noise, barricade roads, throw tantrums and demonstrate causing a crisis designed to overturn the election result and then triggering a gullible international community to intervene and support them to overturn the sovereign will of the Kenyan people. \nThe diplomatic missions must allow the rule of law and respect for our institutions to prevail. It is for this reasons that there shall be no negotiated presidency in Kenya. The October 26th Elections must proceed as scheduled. \nMr Murkomen is the Senator, Elgeyo-Marakwet County RELATED TOPICS:",

One, for leaving the service without permission; he ran away from the country. And two, for the embarrassment he has brought to the government,” Adesina said, on Monday.",

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, has appealed to the Federal Government to hand over federal roads in the country to the state governments for effective management so as to ensure long term viability. He made the appeal when he received the Senate Committee on Works led by its Chairman, Senator Kabiru Gaya , at the Government House in Sokoto late on Monday, October 23, 2017. \"There is the need for the federal government to hand over the roads to states because state governments are closer to the people and we have more efficient methods of supervision. \"If this is done, it will go a long way in ensuring that the vast majority of major roads and highways in the country are well maintained,\" he said. Tambuwal said Sokoto State government will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that the infrastructural development of Nigeria is given utmost attention. He equally solicited the support of the National Assembly to facilitate the reimbursement of the money the state government spent on the repairs of some federal roads in its domain. In his remarks, Senator Gaya said they were in the state for the conduct of their oversight functions. He lauded Tambuwal's efforts especially in the area of infrastructural development. ALSO READ: Sokoto government to construct N2.8 billion water schemes Senator Gaya also assured that his committee will facilitate the reimbursement of the funds used by the state government in the repairs of federal roads. He particularly thanked Governor Tambuwal for his commitment to see to the completion of the Sokoto-Jega-Yauri-Kontagora road which is currently under construction.

      "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commsion, EFCC, has sealed all the properties belonging to embattled ex-chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Pension Reforms, Abdulrasheed Maina. \nMaina, who has been accused of complicity in N2bn fraud, has reportedly gone into hiding. \nThe civil servant was declared wanted by the EFCC in November 2015 for alleged fraud. \nHowever, Maina surprisingly resurfaced this month as an acting director in the Ministry of Interior, a development that triggered a nationwide uproar, forcing president Buhari to order for his immediate disengagement from service. \nThe EFCC Spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, while speaking on the issue on Monday, said the commission was still on his trail. \nHe, however, stated that the commission had marked his houses in Abuja, including a house in Jabi said to be worth about $2m. \nUwujaren told Punch, “Yes, his properties were marked today. To the best of my knowledge, he has not yet been arrested.” \nAnother source within the anti-graft agency was quoted as saying that Maina was moving around town in a bulletproof Range Rover Sports Utility Vehicle and other expensive vehicles. \nThe source said, “We have traced him to a hotel in Kaduna where he went to spend the weekend; we know that the DSS is protecting him and the DG DSS, deployed men to protect him. But make no mistake, we will arrest him, already we’ve frozen all his accounts.” \n“He stays in a property which is a DSS safe house. He moves around in a convoy of about two or three vehicles. I personally saw him alighting from a Range Rover SUV last week with about four DSS officials.”",

      "text": "41 minutes ago General Sun News 10 The Nigeria Basketball Federation has invited 16 players to camp for the FIBA Africa organized 3×3 championships to be held in Lome, Togo. The 3×3 men and women’s teams would be in camp for 8 days for the championship starting from the 1st of November. The Women’s team would be led by Nkechi Akashili and Chioma Udeaja both of First Bank Women Basketball Club of Lagos who were members of the 2017 Afrobasket women championship winning team in Mali. The list released on Monday also has Chidinma Deborah and Nkemuwa Akaraiwe of First Bank who were also part of the Afrobasket preparation. IGP Queens Basketball club duo of Grace Okonkwo and Christiana Isaac and Dolphins’ Roselyn Queen Ulabo as well as Josette Anaswem complete the list of invited players. For the men, eight players were drawn from Kano Pillars, Civil Defence, Rivers Hoopers and Kwara Falcons for the apex 3×3 basketball event in Africa. Yahaya Abdul, Azuoma Dike and Lucky Subel were invited from Pillars for the camping exercise, which would be held at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium, Lagos. Joel Ijigba of Civil Defence would be making his national team debut following an impressive season with Civil Defence if selected for the competition while the duo of River Hoopers of Port Harcourt players, Alalibo Owelem Ronald and Ebikoro Dennis Eteimowei and Kwara Falcons’ David Godwin complete the list of invited players for the men. The team will be coordinated by the Federal Capital Territory Basketball Chairman who is the Director of 3×3 Nigeria, Frank Jituboh. Fifa said the award was shortlisted with input from national team coaches, national team captains, media representatives and fans, with each group getting a one quarter weighting. “The process is clear and transparent and we are not involved in the final selection of nominees,” Fifa said in a statement. “However, we have taken note of the concerns raised by the football community and our fans and will take this feedback on board in future editions of The Best Awards.” But Rapinoe said football’s world governing body should have stepped in. “If some random male player, who was not even a full professional, was nominated, I’m sure they would step in for that, so it’s disappointing that the same hasn’t been done for us,” she said. Castellanos plays for the Florida State university team and had never represented Venezuela at senior or even under-20 level. She has 14 goals in 15 games so far for Florida State this season and six in nine for Santa Clarita Blue Heat – the Californian pro-am outfit she turned out for in the off-season. The awards recognise performances between November 2016 and August 2017, and the winner will be announced at a ceremony at the London Palladium on Monday evening. Conspicuous by their absence from the shortlist are players like Australia forward Sam Kerr, who became the all-time leading scorer in the National Women’s Soccer League in the United States, and England striker Jodie Taylor, who was top scorer at Euro 2017.",

      "text": "IT relevant to all human endeavours –FUNAAB Acting VC \nChux Ohai \nThe Acting Vice-Chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Prof. Ololade Enikuomehin, has declared that Information Technology is applicable to all human endeavours. \nEnikuomehin said this at the 2nd International Conference on Applied Information Technology, themed, ‘Exploring Information Technology Innovations for National Development’, recently organised by the Nigerian Computer Society in collaboration with the university in Abeokuta. \nThe acting vice-chancellor, who was represented by the Dean, College of Physical Sciences of the university, Prof. Amidu Mustapha, described the theme as apt, relevant and very timely to the present situation in the country. \nNoting that Nigeria was in dire need of new ways of achieving development, he said, “From my point of view, that means new ways of doing things and making change in our ways of doing things, which is synonymous with development.” \nEnikuomehin also said that there were no specific reserved seats for NCS members in the Information Technology world, noting that the field was for all, as most of the land-sweeping innovations were found outside the formal boundary of the computer science family. \nHe, however, commended the organisers of the conference and challenged the participants to cross-fertilise ideas into innovativeness that would make life easier and transactions a lot faster. \nEncouraging starters to venture into innovating in IT, the acting vice-chancellor \nstressed that Africans could turn such disadvantage into an advantage and make innovative ways of solving the myriad of problems. \nAlso delivering the keynote address titled, Exploring Information Technology Innovation for National Development through Application of Cloud Computing in the Nigerian Education Landscape , Prof. Sanjay Misra of the Covenant University, Ogun State, described Cloud Computing as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, adding that CLOUD, as an acronym, meant Computing Location independent Online Utility available on-Demand. \nMisra highlighted the challenges facing Cloud Computing within the Nigerian educational context, saying that privacy, data availability and traditional security were factors affecting it. He, therefore, proffered solutions through privacy and control, accessibility and authentication, which could be used to guard against the challenges. Misra, who is also a visiting Professor to the University of Alcala in Spain, further stated that while many people had concerns about Cloud Computing, there was no doubt that it was changing the way people provided systems and services. \nHe said, “The more informed IT Departments are about the cloud, the better the position they will be in when making decisions about deploying, developing and maintaining systems in the cloud.” He noted that the decision to move to cloud-based services should fit into the institution’s overall objectives, stressing that before any services were moved to the cloud, the institution’s management should ensure such actions are consistent with their strategic plans. \nThe Chairman, Local Organising Committee of the Conference, Prof. Adio Akinwale, in his welcome address, recalled that two years ago, when the body started the Conference, the overwhelming need of Information Technology and its application for the development of Africa and Nigeria in particular was a necessity. “The theme is necessary at this critical moment when governments at all levels are seeking quick solutions to our economic recession”, as Professor Akinwale added that Information Technology had cut across all disciplines, noting that it had become increasingly important, as innovation was the key driver of national development. \nThe President of NCS, Prof. Adesola Aderounmu, said that IT had transformed and would continue to transform all aspects of human endeavours, namely: commerce, finance, education, energy, health care and manufacturing. Others include the government, national security, transportation, communications, entertainment, science and engineering, among others. \nCopyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

By Sifiso Jimta Tuesday, October 24, 2017 05:30 ~ \nPOLICE Minister Fikile Mbalula yesterday visited the house where Nigerians allegedly attacked six cops recently. \nMbalula claimed the cops were on duty and found a body in the house in Vanderbijlpark, in the Vaal. \n“A group of Nigerians attacked the police,” he claimed. \n“The people on the premises were undermining the law and police reacted sharply.” \nThe minister was accompanied by acting national commissioner Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba and Gauteng commissioner Major-General Deliwe de Lange . \nDaily Sun reported the death of Ibrahim Badmus (25), whom witnesses and family members claim cops suffocated on the premises with a plastic bag during a raid. \nWhen angry relatives arrived, they took his lifeless body and put him in the cop van, demanding that cops eat him or bury him. \nMbalula said cases have been opened against the attackers, who are on the run. “One of the cops almost lost his ear.” \nHe said in a raid yesterday 76 people were bust. \nMbalula said the people involved in the assault are wanted by the cops and are believed to have fled to Kempton Park and Joburg. \nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Consulate said they are waiting for the autopsy results. “We do not wish to challenge anyone, as it is under investigation. Badmus will be buried after the autopsy.” Comment on this story",

Even though the police is still investigating the deaths, there are alleged reports that he has been cleared of any involvement in the deaths. A post shared by Davido Adeleke (@davidoofficial) on Oct 22, 2017 at 8:00am PDT Looks like he is putting those incidents behind him as he is getting back in the business of making good music and sold out concerts with his ever-energetic attitude. \nDavido's sold out concert in sierra leone (Instagram/Davido) A big example of Davido's getting back to his good old self-was his recent journey to three African countries, Sierra leone , Benin and Guinea Conakry where he had sold out shows. \nDavido seats next to the Oba of Benin Kingdom, Oba Eware the second (Instagram/Davido) Just a few days ago, it was the one year coronation anniversary of the Oba of Benin Kingdom , and Davido was the lead performer, performing to the spectacle of the guest and the royal family. \nDavido with the Crown Prince of Benin Kingdom after his performance at the one year coronation anniversary of The Oba Of Benin Kingdom (Instagram/Davido) This is a simple way to show that irrespective of the dramas and controversies that have surrounded Davido in the last one month, he has been able to shake off the dust, learn from the past and move on to what he is known for, good music!

      "text": "(Lagos Television) The legal team had lamented to the judge that Jonathan did not respond to its letter requesting him to testify as Metuh's witness. Justice Abang was said to have signed the subpoena later on Monday. Jonathan is expected to appear before the court on Wednesday, October 25, 2017. \"I can authoritatively tell you that Metuh’s legal team filed the subpoena before the judge on Monday and the judge signed the subpoena promptly after the proceedings on Monday,\" a source told Punch. \"The judge indicated in the subpoena that the former President should appear in court on Wednesday. \"But whether or not the former President would appear in court on Wednesday would be dependent on if the court bailiff will be able to serve him at his home in Abuja between Monday and the end of Tuesday.\" Metuh is being tried over the 'shady' N400 million he received from the Office of the National Security Adviser in November 2014. ALSO READ : PDP says he’ll return N400M to show support for anti-corruption war It is believed that the money is part of the $2 billion arms deal, which the then NSA, Sambo Dasuki , alleged shared among PDP chieftains to fund Jonathan's presidential campaign in 2015. Most of Metuh's defence witnesses, including Mr. Ben Nwosu , who ended his testimony earlier on Monday, had insisted that the N400 million was directly authorised by Jonathan.

PDP \nAsadu, who spoke in Nsukka, said All Progressives Congress, APC, will not win 10 percent of the votes in Enugu State in view of the hardship being experienced by Nigerians, especially Ndigbo, who were being punished for complaining about marginalisation. \nHe said Governor Ugwuanyi had, by his prudent management of resources, constructed roads as well as carried out other infrastructure development, even as civil servants were being promptly paid their salaries. \nOn the activities of his local government, Asadu said the greatest problem facing the council was payment of primary school teachers’ salaries and gully erosion, which had been wreaking havoc in the town. \nHe added that majority of the teachers earned from grade levels nine and 16, taking about 80 percent of all monthly allocations.",

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Press Release No comments \nSQL is one of the most challenging and time consuming languages to both learn and write and this makes it all the more difficult to deal with when it is attacked. SQL injection is an attack where a malicious SQL code is executed within code already written to enable the attacker to take control of a web application’s database server. \nThe difficult thing about reducing the chance of an attack is that SQL injection defense isn’t taught in most SQL based courses and so people are often unaware or struggle to know how to defend against such attacks. While SQL injection attacks seem to be as powerful as ever, there are some great defenses that you can put into place that will help in SQL injection attack protection . \nThe biggest thing you remember when you’re putting in place SQL injection defense is that it has to be integrated very deeply. If you don’t cover all the bases then attackers will very easily be able to work their way around the defense mechanisms you have put into place and will essentially render your efforts completely worthless. Once you get into the flow of protecting your SQL code you will be able to integrate it much more easily as and when you are writing the code itself. \nA really simple way of protecting yourself from SQL injection is to limit permissions. This might make things more complicated if there are things that you desperately need permissions for but if you apply this wherever possible then even if an attacker using a SQL injection attack then they won’t get the outcome that they are after. As much as possible limiting accounts to read only or with limited permissions unless it is absolutely necessary will reduce the amount of data attackers are able to get out of it. \nWhen you want to protect your code from SQL injection attacks there are plenty of things you implement into the code itself that will protect you. If you’re wondering how effective your SQL defense coding is then you can use a SQL injection defense test. This will highlight areas that you need to improve on and will help you in the long run when writing code in the future. Share this:",

The next day the family became worried and started to look for her but could not find her.\" \nThe matter was reported to the local police and a search was conducted with the assistance of the community members. On 10 September, the body was found next to the road at Sunrise Forest in the area with severe injuries. It appeared that she was chopped up with a bush knife. Both arms and a head were missing. \nA case of murder was opened at Donnybrook police station for further investigation. Through investigation the suspect was arrested on the same day and took the police to where she had left the victim's body parts. \nOnly one arm was found and the second arm, as well as the head, are still missing. The suspect was charged accordingly and taken to court. \nKwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, condemned the brutal killing of the victim. “It is unbelievable that a woman can allegedly attack and kill another woman in such a cruel manner. Our detectives will thoroughly investigate this case and find out the root cause of such killing,” he said.",

Efforts by the municipality to recover the vehicle have hit a brick wall, resulting in the dispute spilling into the High Court. \nChitungwiza Municipality, through its lawyers Kantor & Immerman Legal Practitioners, on Friday filed an urgent chamber application at the High Court claiming back its vehicle from Mr Makunde. Mr Makunde’s five-year contract with the local authority ran from August 20, 2012 to August 19 this year. \nThis year, the local authority suspended Mr Makunde pending investigation into alleged misconduct, but it later emerged that his employment contract had since expired and termination was officially communicated to him on October 5. In the same letter, the municipality asked Mr Makunde to surrender the Land Cruiser V8 (registration number ACC 9620) to acting town clerk Ms Charity Maunga. \nMr Makunde refused to surrender the vehicle, resulting in the court application being filed at the High Court. In the application, Ms Maunga told the court that the vehicle remained council property and that Mr Makunde had no right to retain it after the expiry of his contract.",

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Mayibongwe Madlela Sport Kelvin Kaindu \nRicky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BATTLE lines have been drawn for the Chibuku Super Cup final after How Mine coach Kelvin Kaindu fired a salvo at Harare City and just fell short of accusing the Sunshine City Boys of using juju. \nHow Mine beat Shabanie Mine 3-1 to book a place in the final, while Harare City knocked out Bulawayo City 1-0. Both semi-finals were played as a double header at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. \nA brace by Tinashe Makanda and a strike by Kuda Musharu powered How Mine to a comfortable victory over Shabanie Mine, while Martin Vengesayi scored Harare City’s solitary goal. \nResponding to Harare City coach Philani Ncube’s barbs before the semi-finals draw that he was not worried about How Mine and could play them anywhere in the country and still win, Kaindu said he is looking forward to the final. \n“We’re playing a game (the final) where the opponents wanted to play us and it has happened. We wait to see what is going to happen. We’re playing a team that plays the game before kick-off. I know you understand what I’m talking about,” said Kaindu. \n“There’s a lot that is involved, there will be the battle on the field and battle outside. I think God will be on our side,” he said. \nThis will be the second time Kaindu and Ncube meet in the final of a major competition. \nKaindu led Highlanders to the 2013 Mbada Diamonds Cup victory by beating How Mine, then coached by Ncube. \nThe Zambian fancies his chances of winning a second major cup. \n“The chances are quite bright if you’re in the final; you have the possibility of lifting it. There are only 90 minutes standing ahead of us and if we can come up with a good side and focus on what we’re doing and believe in what we can do, we will make it. \n“We know we’re playing a team that believes in other things, that is their strength, but for us we worship God and we trust in the Almighty. This one is a battle which has started and I think there’ll be many issues that will come out. \n“There will be football being played even at night or even before the game. But we believe that at the end of the day this is what someone wanted and I’m happy that God has allowed it to be like that,” Kaindu said. \nHow Mine’s road to the final began with a 2-1 first round win over Bantu Rovers before they beat Chapungu by a similar score line in the quarterfinals. \nHarare City started their campaign with a 2-1 win over Highlanders followed by a 1-0 win over Black Rhinos. \nNcube promised to give How Mine a good fight in the final. \n“We’re not going to the final to give How Mine the Cup on a silver platter and hopefully Kaindu will have a soft spot for us as he did against Bulawayo City and give untested players a run. \n“One thing for sure is it puts me under pressure coaching a team in this tournament that has won it before and reached the final twice and represented Zimbabwe in the Caf Confederations Cup. But I don’t want to be the coach that finishes in the semi-final and now that we’ve progressed to the final, we want to win it,” said Ncube. \n@ZililoR",

Owner Andrew Masterson, of Milagro Farm near Oyster Bay, is the first farmer to win both the Dairy Queen and Beef Queen titles, with Milagro Power 1324 winning the latter titlePicture: Supplied \nAn Eastern Cape cattle farmer won top honours when two of his cows trotted off with the coveted titles of 2017 Agri-Expo Livestock Beef Queen and Dairy Queen. \nAndrew Masterson, 50, from Milagro Farms near Oyster Bay, made history earlier this month when he became the first farmer to leave the country’s biggest livestock expo with both titles. \nWhile most farmers tend to concentrate on breeding only beef or dairy cows, Masterson believes it is important to hedge your bets in case the market for one of your commodities takes a downward turn. \n“Our primary business has always been dairy, but over time we have expanded into beef and a little into sheep as well,” he said. \n“That way, should milk prices drop we still have other avenues to keep the business flourishing.” \nHis business consists of 530 dairy cows, 300 beef cattle and a herd of sheep. \nDespite his split focus, Masterson’s entries into this year’s Agri-Expo Livestock on October 14 in Stellenbosch set him apart from other breeders. \nMilagro Power 1324, a four-year-old Angus, had the length, width and weight the panel of international judges was looking for, making her the obvious choice for Beef Queen among 120 other beef cattle. \nThis title comes after Power also walked away with the Supreme Female Champion crown at this year’s Angus National Championship in May. \nIn the dairy division, Milagro Sexie 13140, a Holstein cow, showed the main characteristic the judges ranked highest of all – the award-winning udder. \n“Back at the farm Sexie delivers about 48 litres of milk daily, and a total of more than 12 tons of milk measured over a 305-day measurement period,” Masterson said. \n“However, none of this came into play at the show. For the judges her lean frame and exceptional udder was enough to win her the title.” \nAgri-Expo chief executive Johan Ehlers said for one farmer to walk away with both titles was an exceptional achievement.

Unknown to the victim, the stranger together with accomplices who lie in wait, robs the unsuspecting person of all his/her withdrawn cash. Together in this scam there is a suspect attired in full police uniform who approaches the victim and the other person telling them that they must get into his vehicle as they are suspects in a theft case. The victim is then dropped off and left penniless.” \n“We urge community members to be wary of this kind of scam. Do not make small talk with anyone unfamiliar when emerging from the bank. Do not trust anyone who promotes ‘get rich quick schemes.’ Greed can lead to dangerous situations. Safeguard your life and your cash and do not mix and mingle with strangers,” added Cpt Naidoo.

The initiative, which is led by Audi, Cricket South Africa (CSA) and former Proteas quick and development guru, Mfuneko Ngam, is the first designed to utilise state-of-the-art technology to unearth the hidden gems of South African fast blowing. \nIt is currently taking place around the country and identifies a number of talented local young bowlers who will be given the chance to prove themselves in front of CSA’s development structures. \nLead talent scout, Mfuneko Ngam, said, “Our first events in Gauteng and Eastern Cape were resounding successes and this was no different. I have been very impressed by the level of talent we have uncovered so far. We are very excited at the prospect of one of these young bowlers following in the footsteps of the great Proteas bowlers who came before them.” \nOn the day, local bowlers between the ages of 15 and 18 were given the opportunity to showcase their talent in front of a powerful development team. \nBowlers were given the chance to illustrate their skills in the nets with the most promising selected to have their bowling measured on the Audi Bowling Lab – a set-up which utilises state-of-the-art PitchVision technology to instantly analyse a bowler’s performance by comparing pace, line, length, deviation and bounce to that of a current Proteas bowler. \nNgam and his team, which included CSA representatives and local coaches, utilised the scoring system of the Audi Bowling Lab to select the talented boys and girls who will now be put in front of CSA development structures. \nTrevor Hill, head of Audi South Africa, said, “Today continued our search for standout fast bowlers and Durban did not disappoint. As progressive partner to the Proteas, Audi is proud to be able to take our partnership with CSA to the next level by driving progress in a development space. The prospect of potentially uncovering the next Ntini or Ngam, together with CSA, is something we are not only excited by but which we are striving towards.” SHARE",

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Clearance Munondo Entertainment Hillary Makaya \nSenior Arts Reporter This year’s winner for Miss Intercontinental Zimbabwe 2017-2018 is Hillary Makaya. The 18-year-old beauty queen walked away with the coveted title after beating other 23 girls over the weekend. She is set to represent the country at this year’s Miss Intercontinental World in Panama in December. The pageant which is in its 46th edition will see more than 80 contestants from across the world vying for the coveted title. Makaya, who earlier this won the Miss Teen Heritage World said, she was ready to take the world stage by storm. \n“I think this is my year. I was shocked at the same time excited that I am again going to represent the country in Panama. I am honoured for this privilege. This is my second best pageant and I believe I will bring the crown home. Posh will be dressing me for the finale,” she said. The lanky model is set to leave for Panama on December 7 ahead of the boot camp. \n“I will start putting some action into my projects on November 19. Now I am busy writing my advanced level examinations. I would like to start my foundation, ‘The Hillary Makaya Foundation’, whose focus would be helping the children of Zimbabwe. We have set plans in place that will see the foundation help shape the lives of the underprivileged children. This is an open window for me to inspire, import and be a role model of the children in my country,” she said. Asked, how she will market Zimbabwe in Panama, Makaya said she will use the same modus operandi. \n“Remember, I am not new to this, I will use the same concept I did in Sri Lanka, and it’s just that different country though. I will focus on promoting our tourist destinations and tell them about our beautiful culture. I will make sure I had visited some of the important destinations and understand them better before I leave. I am glad I have support from family and will continue with my grooming classes,” she said. Last year award winner model Hilda Mabu made the nation proud when she made it in the top 15 at Miss Intercontinental World.",

The Police are often called to stop these fights.\n“Usually when there are kids fighting on the street, we would call the police but by the time the police arrive they have already stopped fighting and would run away,” he said.\n“They would leave their families too so that they are not caught.”\nThe young man from Vaitele Fou feels sorry for the youth members that are involved.\n“It’s not just them that are affected. Their families are affected too.”\nAtonio Fepuleai works at Sheraton Samoa Aggie Grey’s Hotel.\nHe is grateful for his job and wishes that more young people could be employed so that they have something to channel their energy towards.\nHe also mentioned that another cause of the fights is that there are many new people moving into Vaitele Fou.\n“So many new people are moving here and they come with their own different mentalities,” said Atonio.\n“Within Vaitele Fou when a new kid in the village beats up one of the kids that has been living here for a long time, all the other old youth members from the village gang up together with the kid that has been beaten up and goes after the new kid to chase him down,” he said.\n“That is the reality here. It is so sad.”",

The follow-up chemotherapy and radiation will be done at Grey’s Hospital. \nThe first R40 000 raised was to pay for her Anaesthetist and Surgeon, the second R40 000 (which is almost there) is the deposit for the hospital, while the remaining R40 000 still to be raised, will be the outstanding amount for the hospital stay. \nMandy’s cause has brought many Pietermaritzburg’s residents together to assist this woman, who herself, is someone who has constantly given back to those less fortunate. A huge fundraiser will be held in the first weekend of December, with an auction and stunning raffle prizes to be won.

Photo: BackpagePix \nJOHANNESBURG – An emotional Khulu Sibiya, the SuperSport United chairman, described how he broke down crying in front of his TV while watching the club qualify for the final of the Caf Confederation Cup on Sunday night after beating Club Africain in Tunisia. \nMatsatsantsa were 4-2 aggregate winners over two legs as they made history in full view of a packed crowd that slowly made its way out of the Stade Olympique de Rades, with the hosts well and truly beaten by a ruthless South African side. \n“I wish my wife was here to tell you how I just started crying when I was watching the game,” said Sibiya at the OR Tambo International Airport as he and club supporters welcomed the team back from a long flight home. \n“I had tears of joy. It was just amazing. Thank you Eric (Tinkler, the coach) for coming in and doing what you have done. You are an amazing man. \n“I must reveal that it was Stan (Matthews, the CEO) who dropped your name in the hat when we were looking for a coach, not me. It’s not easy for any new coach in the club to come in and just make things happen.” \nSuperSport will travel away to the Democratic Republic of Congo to face defending champions TP Mazembe in the first leg of the final on November 17, and then host the return match a week later at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. \nThe club are also trying to move that second leg to a Saturday, November 25, instead of the game being played on Friday night. This is to allow more fans the opportunity to attend and give them an edge in terms of home advantage.",

The next day the family became worried and started to look for her but could not find her.\" \nThe matter was reported to the local police and a search was conducted with the assistance of the community members. On 10 September, the body was found next to the road at Sunrise Forest in the area with severe injuries. It appeared that she was chopped up with a bush knife. Both arms and a head were missing. \nA case of murder was opened at Donnybrook police station for further investigation. Through investigation the suspect was arrested on the same day and took the police to where she had left the victim's body parts. \nOnly one arm was found and the second arm, as well as the head, are still missing. The suspect was charged accordingly and taken to court. \nKwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, condemned the brutal killing of the victim. “It is unbelievable that a woman can allegedly attack and kill another woman in such a cruel manner. Our detectives will thoroughly investigate this case and find out the root cause of such killing,” he said.",

      "text": "October 24, 2017 Press Release No comments \nPublic relations on social media marketing have become increasingly popular. They help reach a wider audience, build credibility among the online community, and improve relationships with customers. \nOne might think that it’s easy to pay someone to recommend your brand and wait for amazing metrics. However, deep analysis is needed to find the right person that will definitely increase your content’s reach and keep your followers engaged. \nHow to identify the perfect match \nThe perfect match occurs when the influencer’s audience happens to be very similar to the brand’s target. Moreover, this person is highly acclaimed among the company’s followers because they share similar interests and values. \nOnly those social media strategists who truly know their audience are able to identify the influencer who will share the brand’s content with the right kind of people, who will ultimately join the company’s ideal online community. \nPR on social media marketing helps develop more honest relationships with customers. It is essential to have a team with good connections to be able to make contact with the ideal influencer. \nThe risks \nNevertheless, strategists should know that they won’t be able to control the content produced by this person but that’s what makes it honest and appealing to the audience. \nIt is essential to constantly monitor the impact caused by the influencer in order to find out whether it was a good choice. One of the benefits social media platforms offer is associated with the possibility to make changes anytime if needed. \nIf the chosen influencer does little to help the company in terms of its business purpose, strategists can quickly stop relying on this person. However, any changes must be made carefully, always considering that bad decisions can trigger long-lasting conversations on social media with high damage potential. \nBenefits Of Social Media Marketing \nSocial media is a recent enough thing. It has shot to the limelight and to its credit, it does seem to have many benefits apart from finding long-lost friends! To a business or an entrepreneur, social media has come down like a boon. It is an easy, simple, and relatively inexpensive way of marketing and promoting your brand, business, or product. In this article, we will take a look at all the benefits of social media marketing. \nIn a survey, 92% people believed social media marketing to be indispensable for their business. As many as 80% of the people reported that their traffic to their websites has increased. This would mean social media marketing does pay off! Let’s take a look at the other benefits. \nIncreased traffic flow : It is one of the most commonly reaped benefits. Using social media, you can direct traffic to your business website and increase the traffic incrementally. Every page you post in the social media, every image, and every article will increase traffic to new pages of your website, increasing the number of visitors. \nBrand Recognition : Every time you post on the social media about your business or product is a stamp of visibility. More people become aware of your brand and you will have the opportunity to gain many new customers. \nInexpensive marketing : Marketing is a very old concept. It has been known to cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to market your business, product, or service on the traditional channels. Social media marketing has the power to reach to millions of people across the globe and from all walks of life for a sum fractional of that. \nCommunication and Feedback : Social media is an easy enough way for customers to reach out to the company and let them know their grievances or appreciation. Grievances that come to your attention in this manner could be swiftly dealt with, which the customer would surely appreciate, getting you into everybody’s good books again. Share this:",

      "text": "iPhone 8 sales sluggish, consumers waiting for iPhone X? By Hadlee Simons on 24 October, 2017 \nApple’s iPhone 8 went on sale last month and you’d expect sales to be fantastic. But reports find that the 2017 models just aren’t selling as well as the iPhone 7 . \nA report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) found iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sales to account for 16% of US sales for the quarter ending 1 October. How does that stack up to previous sales? \n“On the other hand, in the same time frame last year, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus together accounted for 43% of sales. Two years ago, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus represented 24% of sales. And, three years ago, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were 46% of sales in their launch quarter,” CIRP’s Josh Lowitz noted. \n“So, in terms of consumer demand and reception, the 8 and 8 Plus have a share of total sales that makes them look much more like an ‘S’ model, while the 7 and 7 Plus was closer to the very well-received 6 and 6 Plus.” American consumers might be waiting for the iPhone X or grabbing the iPhone 7 before committing to the iPhone 8 \nA second CIRP analyst pointed to the announcement of the iPhone X as a possible reason for “depressed” iPhone 8 demand. \nThe news follows a Reuters report , which found that many consumers were opting for the iPhone 7 over the iPhone 8. The report, citing several carrier store surveys, also found consumers were waiting for the iPhone X. \nThe tenth anniversary iPhone will ship with an OLED screen for the first time (adopting an Essential Phone-style design), Face ID in lieu of a fingerprint scanner and optical image stabilisation on the telephoto camera. Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat. More RELATED",

The company's official said the plan will be carried out next year. \n\"Our business plan for 2018 is to become an e-money issuer,\" The bank's distribution and services director Edwin Dwidjajanto said on Monday, October 2017. \nRead: Muamalat Named Best Islamic Bank in Indonesia 2017 \n\nIf the plan materializes, Edwin said, BSM will become Indonesia's first Islamic bank that issues its own e-money separately, not through co-branding with its holding. \nEdwin said the bank also supports the government's program to fully implement a non-cash system in toll roads. BSM plans to distribute and promote their e-money cards by exempting users from paying for the card-making fee. \nThis year, BSM plans to produce an additional of 25,000 e-money cards. \n\"The sharia e-money market is still very small because Islamic bank customers only account for a little over five percent [of the total banking market],\" he said. \nBISNIS",

      "text": "24 Oct 2017 | Save | Email | Print | PDF By: Gill Randall Ten seconds. That's all the attention a consumer will give your brand in a supermarket environment before considering a purchase. If they're shopping online, you may get lucky and have a whole 15 seconds. This is according to a study by the EBI. Gill Randall. The Ehrenberg Bass Institute (EBI) is the world’s largest centre for research into evidence based marketing. As members of EBI for the past 15 years, Spark Media has access to their wealth of research on consumer behaviour.“As consumers, we have limited time and attention spans,” says Gill Randall, joint-CEO, Spark Media. “Supermarket shoppers have to make decisions fast – EBI shows that most of us take less than 10 seconds to arrive at a decision, while online purchases take 15 seconds or less.”It’s safe to say that online and offline shoppers behave similarly in respect to speed. The explanation lies in the fact that shoppers have already established loyalties and memory structures for certain brands and need little evaluation or confirmation in certain categories.Interestingly, buyers that are in the shop already limit their category choices down to just a few options, while screening the others out. Online purchasers tend to do the same. Implications for marketers “The amount of time spent selecting a brand has serious implications for a marketer though,” says Randall. “If shoppers choose and buy really quickly then they’re acting on habit. However, this does not translate into monogamist brand loyalty in real life, but rather repertoire (polygamous) loyalty. As consumers, we buy brands that we ‘know of’ and ‘think well of’. Brands that occupy a large ‘share’ of our minds are easily thought of in buying situations, and are the most likely to be bought. Marketing efforts need to build this ‘mental availability’.Having mental (being thought of) and physical availability (location of the shop to the consumer) is crucial to a brand’s success. Consumer’s past experiences with a brand is another critical factor to getting them over the finish line. Recognition of colours, logos and characters on packs makes a huge difference to a shopper. If products are instantly recognisable and trusted, they’re more likely to be bought again and again – if they’ve delivered on expectations of course.“Shoppers don’t want to hunt for their favourite brands,” she says, “whether they’re in store or online. EBI shows us that mass reach advertising is key to nudge the brand in a consumer’s memory – even in an online context, and that consistency in distinctive brand elements (colours, fonts and characters) will help shoppers find your brands quickly time after time.It’s just 10 seconds, but by applying these evidence based marketing tactics, brands can increase the chances of being added to our repertoires and hopefully, on occasion, being chosen.”",

UPM is the world's largest maker of graphic papers such as newsprint and magazine paper, where demand is falling in the West due to a shift to digital publishing. But the group has protected profitability with cost cuts and by focusing on pulp, needed not only in making paper but also in tissue products and packaging board, and which has a brighter outlook than paper. Its pulp prices increased by 12 percent in the third quarter from a year ago on the back of strong demand in China. \"The markets were favourable and we achieved good growth in delivery volumes. We also succeeded in mitigating input cost inflation with sales price increases and cost efficiency measures,\" CEO Jussi Pesonen said in a statement on Tuesday. Adjusted operating profit rose 12 percent from a year ago to 351 million euros ($413 million), compared with an average analyst expectation of 321 million. Pesonen said full-year profit would increase from last year, adding that the company would continue measures to reduce costs. Shares in the company rose 1.8 percent by 0707 GMT. \"UPM's profit machine has changed gear, (the) bottom line is clearly above forecasts ... But they weren't able to increase their core EBITDA (earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization) nor cash flow from high levels,\" analysts at Inderes Equity Research, who rate the stock \"reduce\", said. UPM also said it was considering construction of a new biorefinery in Germany costing hundreds of millions of euros, and that it plans to spend 50 million euros on expanding its plywood mill in Russia.

      "text": "By: Lauren Crooks An effective content strategy begins and ends with excellent copy. Whether your goal is lead generation, sales conversion or brand-building, what you say and how you say it is the most powerful way to engage with your audience. Here are 10 tips on how to escalate your copywriting from good to great: © gmast3r - 123RF.com 1. It all begins with research Communicating from a position of knowledge is essential to weave an authentic, interesting story. Information unlocks limitless possibilities. You can never be too well-versed in your subject matter; endeavour to become an expert in the topic you’re writing about. Legendary copywriter Gary Bencivenga says: “The best copywriters are the most tenacious researchers. Like miners, they dig, drill, dynamite, and chip until they have carloads of valuable ore. John Caples advised me once to gather seven times more interesting information than I could possibly use... Research is the infallible cure for writer's block.” 2. Brand identity is everything Every brand has their own unique voice, style, and unique selling points, and this should be cultivated in every single marketing execution to speak to your target audience’s needs and desires. Consistency is key: a sharply defined personality is the common thread that creates the consumer’s perception of the brand across contexts. A crystal-clear brand identity differentiates yourself from the competition to secure a greater market share. 3. It’s all in the headline Headlines are devised to catch consumer’s attention. If your headline entices a consumer to read more, the battle is pretty much won. In order to craft a powerful headline, write the body copy first and then pick the strongest phrases to use as headlines and subheadings. Simplicity is key: straightforward is always more effective than overly clever. Provoke some sort of emotional response in your reader to grab their attention and urge them to find out more. While it can be effective, avoid using ‘clickbait’ headlines. Your brand is better than that. 4. Keep it simple When in doubt, keep it simple. This doesn’t mean compromising on jargon or technical ability, it means keeping your message as concise as possible to provide your consumer with an immediate understanding of what you’re offering. Never assume knowledge; explain concepts as if readers are learning them for the first time. 5. Tell a story The magic of marketing is in the storytelling. Taking a consumer on a journey captures their attention, elicits an emotional response and draws them into a world they want to be a part of. Creating a narrative makes for far more interesting content, and does not come across as a hard sell. 6. Speak your customer’s language A sure-fire way to appeal to your target audience is by using the language that they use every day. Communicating in colloquial language develops affinity and trust for your brand because they recognise themselves in your words. The language you use is a relationship-building exercise, creating connections between your brand and their consumers. 7. Resonate with your audience Create interest and buy-in for your brand by appealing to your target audience’s emotions. While your product offering or service may be relevant to your consumer, they are ultimately won over though the resonant quality of what you’re offering. Consumers are geared to shop on wants rather than needs, so speaking to their desires and deepest emotions persuades them to connect with your copy and ultimately what you’re selling. 8. Work an angle The power of persuasion is in the positioning of a product or brand. Creating a unique or unusual angle stimulates curiosity and captures attention. In a sea of competitors, a unique position is the hook you need to pique consumer’s interest. 9. Open with your strongest point \"Save the best for last\" definitely does not apply to skilful copywriting. Most consumers are more likely to read the beginning than the end, therefore it is more persuasive to introduce your best points first. The strongest points capture attention best, so it makes sense to lead with them. This formulation also provides an element of instant gratification for readers: they know exactly what value is in it for them before they take the time to read ahead. 10. Include a call to action If you don’t specifically ask people to do something, chances are they won’t do it. Everything you write should either lead or close with a call to action to convert consumers. Calls to action typically offer something of value to the consumer, and is both relevant to and resonant with the target audience.",

      "text": "Online marketing for the motor industry 24 Oct 2017 08:15 Marketing Lemon – for everyone in the ad-world, this is the instantly-recognised genius of the best advertising campaign catch-phrase ever created for a car, says Marko Mandusic, account director at Flume. He says this time capsule to the 'mad men' era of advertising was the 'different' and honest execution that advertising should be. VIEW GALLERY Some would call the ad a 'game-changer' – the revolution that advertising needed. Not just in the automotive industry, but also in relation to any consumer goods or services that disruptively made their way across our senses, either by print, TV, or radio media.So, how has automotive advertising changed since the introduction of digital media and instant accessibility? Well, a number of brands have introduced interactive videos, like the BMW M2 360° challenge .Others have partnered with massive gaming platforms, essentially launching a car digitally to the PlayStation generation before any journalist could even get close enough to distinguish the difference between the new model and its predecessor – Porsche 991 GT2 RS launch .The use of technology, and various digital platforms with an overall creative idea, undeniably raises awareness for new product launches, which evidently increase interest and test- drive numbers at local dealerships. Even though the Pfaff Auto Instant Direct Mail campaign was a direct mailer campaign, the use of technology to instantly create a personalised piece of content is brilliant.Now, the right-hand side of my cynical petrol-head brain points out that most campaigns are current recreations of global creative ideas revised for local markets. This is smart as it keeps production costs low, but often they miss the mark as the intended target market does not connect with the messaging. What does this mean for local online advertising within the automotive industry? Well, I don’t believe that anyone looking for a new car is swayed by a fancy video or rich media banners but are rather influenced by the expansive number of reviews, online content, and general information that is available through a few quick taps of their phone, or even with the activating phrases 'ok Google' or 'hey Siri'.ZMOT, the Zero Moment of Truth, released by Google back in 2012, is the road that automotive advertising is currently speeding towards. With platforms like Drive Tribe, YouTube , and blogs, almost every international motoring journalist is independently releasing written and video content, reviews, and updates daily. What does this mean? Well, simply put, for every advertising campaign launched by a brand about a new product, there are already 15 written reviews, 25 videos, and hundreds of Instagram or social media posts, reviews, and write-ups about the new car – and that is only on the day of the campaign launch. By sunrise, those numbers would almost immediately double.Now, don’t get me wrong, out of the hundreds of posts, there are only a handful of quality reviews that eventually make their way to the top organic search results of any Google or YouTube search.Am I implying that manufacturers and advertising agencies should hang up their magic mice and Wacom tablets and call it a day? No, that would be mad. What I am implying is simply that, as marketers, we need to be more strategic, and focus on the overall experience that the brand offers.This extends to touchpoints outside of the realms of advertising and social media pages, all the way from ultra high-definition online 3D videos and custom landing pages, to the waiting room of each individual dealership that relates to the brand.There is evidence of global brands extending each touchpoint with the number of BMW concept stores that have been launched in multiple cities around the world. These stores have extended the professional, high-end look and feel of the brand through to individual stores, thus, controlling the environment and the user journey, transferring the online experience and their advertising presence and overall brand persona from the screen to the showroom floor. How does this affect a brand within the consumer’s purchasing journey? Ultimately, it benefits the brand, as consumers are not turned away toward competitors just because they had a bad experience within a specific dealership. That is the current state when buying a new car in the South African market.We have reached a point where, no matter how well-crafted your messaging, images, and overall campaign are, they will always fall short in the consumer’s mind when stacked up against 100 online reviews. With that said, research, technology, and development are improving daily, and we have almost reached a point where it is truly a challenge to build a terrible new car.So, how do we differentiate between brands if products of similar prices are about to reach similar levels of engineering, and consumers are listening to trusted reviews over crafted advertising? Personally, I think brands should look at adding a slice of lemon, all the way from their banner ads, to their showroom floors.For   www.flume.co.za   , Twitter or on Instagram .

      "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commsion, EFCC, has sealed all the properties belonging to embattled ex-chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Pension Reforms, Abdulrasheed Maina. \nMaina, who has been accused of complicity in N2bn fraud, has reportedly gone into hiding. \nThe civil servant was declared wanted by the EFCC in November 2015 for alleged fraud. \nHowever, Maina surprisingly resurfaced this month as an acting director in the Ministry of Interior, a development that triggered a nationwide uproar, forcing president Buhari to order for his immediate disengagement from service. \nThe EFCC Spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, while speaking on the issue on Monday, said the commission was still on his trail. \nHe, however, stated that the commission had marked his houses in Abuja, including a house in Jabi said to be worth about $2m. \nUwujaren told Punch, “Yes, his properties were marked today. To the best of my knowledge, he has not yet been arrested.” \nAnother source within the anti-graft agency was quoted as saying that Maina was moving around town in a bulletproof Range Rover Sports Utility Vehicle and other expensive vehicles. \nThe source said, “We have traced him to a hotel in Kaduna where he went to spend the weekend; we know that the DSS is protecting him and the DG DSS, deployed men to protect him. But make no mistake, we will arrest him, already we’ve frozen all his accounts.” \n“He stays in a property which is a DSS safe house. He moves around in a convoy of about two or three vehicles. I personally saw him alighting from a Range Rover SUV last week with about four DSS officials.”",

Tuesday, October 24, 2017 05:00 ~ \nTHE National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has declined to prosecute a 44-year-old school bus driver for the alleged sexual assault of a 13-year-old pupil earlier this month, due to a lack of evidence. \nHowever, the driver is not off the hook just yet because four pupils are expected to give statements to police. \nThe driver was arrested on October 20 after a teacher and a pupil reported that he allegedly inappropriately touched a female pupil while she was boarding a bus on October 13 and 16. \nHowever, the NPA says it does not have enough evidence to proceed with a case against him. \nGauteng NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw told News24: \"The NPA declined to prosecute due to the fact that there is no information that suggests any wrongdoing on the side of the bus driver.\" \nThe Gauteng Education Department has noted the decision. \n\"The department takes note of a decision taken by NPA and understands that there are about four learners who will submit statements to the police. We are hopeful that law enforcement agencies will finalise this matter accordingly,\" spokesperson Steve Mabona said. \nNews24 also previously reported that Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said in a statement that more victims would come forward with information. \nThe driver has since been removed from the school environment and has been released from custody.",

He is believed to be the financier of wanted criminals and he was arrested at Ikot Ibekwe community in the Ukanafun LGA. The suspect is volunteering information about gangs of kidnappers and cult members linked to him.”The spokesman said more than 120,000 litres of stolen fuel was recovered from oil thieves in Rivers State.Our correspondent learnt that troops of 29 Battalion intercepted two trucks in the Uzuaku area, laden with 55,000 and 30,000 litres of fuel.“A patrol team also discovered a re-activated illegal refinery in the Doroko area on October 17; and the site was destroyed by the troops. The troops also destroyed 53 jerrycans of 25 litres and 20 drums of 250 litres in the Akinima and Okrika areas respectively,” Iliyasu added",

Unknown to the victim, the stranger together with accomplices who lie in wait, robs the unsuspecting person of all his/her withdrawn cash. Together in this scam there is a suspect attired in full police uniform who approaches the victim and the other person telling them that they must get into his vehicle as they are suspects in a theft case. The victim is then dropped off and left penniless.” \n“We urge community members to be wary of this kind of scam. Do not make small talk with anyone unfamiliar when emerging from the bank. Do not trust anyone who promotes ‘get rich quick schemes.’ Greed can lead to dangerous situations. Safeguard your life and your cash and do not mix and mingle with strangers,” added Cpt Naidoo.

      "text": "Hijackings by province: Some alarming numbers Industry news / 24 October 2017, 1:26pm / Jason Woosey File photo: Gary van Wyk / Independent Newspapers. \nJohannesburg - The latest SAPS crime statistics, released in Parliament on Tuesday, show that vehicle hijackings continue to rise at an alarming rate. \nCarjackings in South Africa reached a new 10-year high of 16 717 in the 2016/2017 period under review, up 14.5 percent from last year. These hijackings actually declined from 14 855 to 9417 between the 2008/09 and 2011/12 review periods, but since then have increased by a whopping 77.5 percent to 16 717. That’s 46 cars a day. \nMore than half of all carjackings (8610) took place in Gauteng, which saw a 16.9 percent increase over the previous reporting period. Next was KwaZulu-Natal with 3029 hijackings, up 21.5 percent, and followed by the Western Cape (2201), up 8.3 percent. \nThe biggest spike was Mpumalanga, registering a 28.8 percent increase from 629 to 810. \nThe Eastern Cape, in fourth place, saw a marginal decline, from 956 to 955, while Limpopo was up two percent from 450 to 459 and the North West by 5.4 percent (from 370 to 390), while the Free State was down 9.3 percent (from 258 to 234). \nThe Northern Cape, however, which might seem like a statistical anomaly given that just 29 hijackings occurred there, nevertheless recorded a decline of 38.3 percent. \nTruck hijackings \nTruck hijackings in South Africa saw a negligible decline from 1184 to 1183, although some of the provinces did experience worrying increases. \nGauteng still rules the roost here, with 668 recorded in 2016/17, albeit down 3.9 percent. Second highest was Mpumalanga, at 178, down 8.2%, with the Eastern Cape in third place, up 51.9 percent to 82. \nThese were followed by KZN (81 hijackings, +14.1%), Western Cape (58, +26.1%), North West (48, +14.3%), Free State (41, -36.9), Limpopo (27, +80%). \nNo truck hijackings were recorded in the Northern Cape, down from two last year. \nVehicle thefts down \nActual thefts of motor vehicles in SA were down 0.9 percent, from 53 809 to 53 307 in the 2016/17 period, implying that sophisticated modern vehicle security systems are doing their job, albeit at the expense of those motorists who become hijacking victims. \nNo surprise that more than half of all vehicle thefts, 27 674 in total, took place in Gauteng. Second was KZN with 8413 reported incidents, followed by the Western Cape (7381), Eastern Cape (2739), Mpumalanga (2208), North West (2068), Free State (1588), Limpopo (1017) and Northern Cape (219). \nMost provinces were marginally down on last year, with the exception of Gauteng (up 3.9%) and Eastern Cape (up 2.3%). \nPolitical interference blamed \nAlthough vehicle theft levels remain extremely high, it’s the hijacking trend that remains most worrying to motorists, given how it affects their basic safety. \nThe Institute for Security Studies said that SA’s steady rise in armed robbery (up 6.4 percent year on year) and murder (up 1.8 percent) could largely be attributed to “inappropriate political interference in the police”, which had \"weakened\" the organisation. \nFurthermore, ISS head Gareth Newham added: “The same criminals commit many violent crimes from murder to hijacking and armed robbery. Failure by police to identify violent criminals and investigate their crimes just keeps them on the street as a continued public danger. Police could prevent hundreds of hijackings by stopping the activity of just one syndicate.” \nIOL Motoring",

      "text": "SA Victims of Crime Survey 2017: Car theft, hijackings and more... \nCape Town - Vehicle crime statistics released by Police Minister Fikile Mbalula as part of the annual national crime statistics shows an increase of 14.5% in carjacking. \nA total of 16 717 cars were stolen between April 2016 and March 2017 up from 14 602 reported in the previous 12 months. \nREAD: SA crime stats: Rise in carjackings 'alarming' \nA closer look at carjacking in each province reveals that only three (Northern Cape, Free State and the Eastern Cape) out of nine provinces saw a decrease in carjackings compared to April 2015- March 2016. \nLimpopo (+2%) , North West (+5.4%), Western Cape (+8.3%), Gauteng (+16.9&), Kwa-Zulu Natal (+21.5^%) and Mpumalaga (+28.8%) reported an increase in carjackings in the past year. \nTheft of motor vehicle and motorcycle and was down by 0.9% according to Mbalula. \nWhat do you think can be done about vehicle crime in SA? How do you keep yourself and your family safe from becoming vehicle crime victims? Justice Project SA's Howard Dembovsky, says: \"It is extremely worrying to note that the incidents of carjacking reported has climbed to its highest level in the past 13 years, with 16 717 (14.5% increase over last year) incidents having been reported. \"Gauteng remains a hotspot for carjacking, reporting an all-time high of 8,610 incidents (16.9% increase), with Mpumalanga reporting the highest percentage increase (28.8%) in the country and only 3 of the nine provinces in South Africa recording a decrease in carjackings. Truck hijacking and cash in transit robberies are also up by 14.1% and 19% respectively.\"Although it is impossible to glean how many of the 19 016 (1.8% increase) murders reported could be associated with carjacking, truck hijacking and cash in transit robberies it is probable that many were.\"\nDembovsky goes on to say: \"On the score of criminal offences committed by motorists, the number of cases of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug having a narcotic effect (drunken driving) detected decreased marginally from 76 159 in 2015/16 to 75 034 in 2016/17, a decrease of 1.5%. \"It is difficult to say whether this decrease is attributable to a lower number of drivers driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or to a lower volume of them being caught doing so.The conviction rate for DUI offences is and remains very low and this is a worrying factor in road traffic crashes and the injuries and fatalities which accompany them. \"With the significant risks associated with driving, motorists are urged to always have their wits about them and especially to refrain from using intoxicating substances and then driving. Your life and the lives of others may very well depend on your sobriety.\" #CrimeStats : Theft \"out of or from\" motor vehicles down 0.9%. @TeamNews24 — Paul Herman (@PaulHerman88) October 24, 2017 #CrimeStats : SAPS: Trio crimes (carjackings, residential robberies, non-residential robberies) have only reduced in 1 province. @TeamNews24 — Paul Herman (@PaulHerman88) October 24, 2017 \nVehicle security and tracking company Pro-Active SA 's Ryno Schutte says: \"As expected the crime statistics on vehicle crime has increased significantly over the past year, the increase in Carjacking has been indicated as the worst over the past 12 years with the lowest being 9417 in 2011/2012. \n\"There has been a steady increase of 14% year on year to date since 2012/2013. The total increase since 2011/2012 is a staggering 77.5%.\"We once again saw a 14.48% increase in Carjacking over the past financial year. This was expected after the release of the crime statistics in March. When you look at the crime statistics over the nine months released it indicated that there will be around 17 000 carjacking during the 2016/2017 period which was confirmed today. Though there has been a decrease in theft of motor vehicle / motorcycle, vehicle crime in general has increased drastically and vehicle owners are at a greater risk.\" \nSchutte goes on to say that the decrease of a mere 0.93% (502) incidents in theft of motor vehicle and motorcycle does not justify the increase of 14.48% (2 115) in carjacking which places the community at greater risk due to firearms being used in these forms of crime. \n\"Greater vigilance and risk awareness pertaining to vehicle crime is required and extra communication through the local Community Police Forums, Neighbourhood Watches and Security Service Providers to the community and clients. \n\"The increase in Residential Robberies of 7.32% (1532) also needs to be taken into consideration, as this indicated that there are more firearms involved in Robberies in general.\" NEXT ON WHEELS24 X",

      "text": "Mbalula: we have a problem with SAPS leadership By Corruption Watch 24 Oct 2017, 11:29 \nPolice minister Fikile Mbalula today presented the 2016/2017 crime statistics to the parliamentary portfolio committee on police. The statistics cover the period from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. This means that at best, the stats are over six months old. \nMbalula acknowledged that there is a problem of poor leadership in the   (SAPS), and that this has deeply affected the country. \n“Behind the numbers are real feelings, real hurt, real harm,” he said. “We have no time to lose. It’s hurting our economy. There will never be a victory lap until our people feel safe.” \nMbalula assured the audience that he and his team were increasing police capacity and capability. “We want to close the gaps in the leadership of police, and fill vacancies of the national police commissioner and head of DPCI by the end of the year.” \nThe environment in which SAPS operates requires stabilised leadership for its members to succeed in the fight against crime, he added. \nIn August Corruption Watch and   launched a campaign to create public awareness around the appointment of the top two police positions. The organisations are also advocating for a more transparent recruitment process that is based on stringent qualification and experience criteria, and where political agendas play no role. \nMbalula appealed to the public to become more involved in the fight against crime. “Members of the public must be positively involved in efforts to eradicate crime, as it is an issue of national interest and priority.” \nCorruption was not mentioned. In terms of the police stats, it is lumped under commercial crime, which itself falls into the category of other serious crime, together with shoplifting and ‘other theft not mentioned elsewhere’. Other serious crime decreased by 2% over the reporting period, from 479 075 counts to 469 276 – this is 9 799 fewer incidents noted. \nHowever, the sub-category of commercial crime increased in the past two financial years, by 3.1% and 5.2% respectively. As in previous years, there is no breakdown of the types of crime that make up this sub-category. Commercial crime increased in eight provinces except for North West which recorded a decrease. \nFor more detailed information, download the stats as Excel raw data or a document . Wanted: Better police leadership \nAs part of the Top Cops campaign, Corruption Watch and the ISS are running a survey to get public opinion on the process and criteria that should be used in the appointment of the two vacant positions. Anyone may participate and the information gathered will be shared with the president, minister of police and the parliamentary police portfolio committee. \nThe “chop and change” in police leadership has affected the focus and direction of the police, said Mbalula, adding that this cannot be denied. “We must admit it.” \nWhat is needed also is firm leadership from the station level upwards. The public has expressed anger at the lack of service and lack of caring they receive at police stations. “[Officers] must treat our people courteously and with sensitivity – we agree with the people in this. But the police treat them as nuisance. I want to say today to our police force that [citizens] pay for your living, and they are your clients.” \nThe instability at the top has affected police morale, as there is no direction filtering down to the ranks below. To achieve a culture of discipline and smart policing, SAPS needs leadership that can direct policing in the most effective way.",

      "text": "85 Kenyan financial system is likely to be thrown in serious turmoil in two months \nThe Kenyan financial system is likely to be thrown in serious turmoil in two months’ time once the new accounting system comes into force. \nThe Capital Markets Authority says most listed companies are not likely to comply with the International Financial Reporting System-IRFS9 which comes into force on the 1 st of January 2018. \nCMA Head of Market Development Justus Agoti says a taskforce that brings together all players in the financial system is compiling a report on corporate Kenya’s preparedness to migrate to the new accounting standard. \nThe clock is fast ticking towards the 1 st of January 2018. \nAnd with each passing day it is becoming clearly evident that corporate Kenya will be caught flat-footed by the new accounting regime known as the International Financial Reporting System-IFRS 9. \nPolicy makers and accountants in Kenya are not ready to implement the new standard since there are no guidelines to help in the application of IFRS-9. Also Read SMEs hard hit by political uncertainty \nThe new system was approved by global accounting bodies in 2014, allowing accounting and financial bodies to test it and generate guidelines several years in advance before the standard comes into force. \nThe CMA says the guidelines are expected to be published in December 2017, a month before the enforcement of the new standards. \nHead of Market Development Justus Agoti fears that the Kenyan capital market is likely to come under sharp pressure if listed companies fail to comply with IFRS 9. \nCompanies that fail to adapt the new accounting regime are likely to be locked out of the global financial system. \nAccording to the soundness report the Nairobi Securities Exchange, continues to weaken as political noise levels increase forcing foreign investors to dump their share for safer havens.",

      "text": "MTN GROUP MTN says it's on track to meet its full-year guidance despite challenging economic growth across its markets. Picture: Bloomberg \nFluctuating exchange rates have hit MTN’s numbers for the third quarter hard, with reported group total revenue and group service revenue reducing by 13.4% and 14% respectively year on year. However, in constant currency terms, the Johannesburg-headquartered telecommunications provider is showing signs of operational improvement. \nOn a constant currency basis, group total revenue increased by 6.9%, with service revenue up 7.4%. Data revenue increased by 31.4% and digital revenue was up 19.6%. \nHowever, subscriber numbers declined by 0.7% quarter on quarter to 230.2 million, mainly as a result of lower reported subscribers in Nigeria and Uganda. This is due to a refinement in active subscriber definitions in Nigeria and Sim-card registration regulations in Uganda. \nVoice traffic (billable minutes) increased by 9% and data traffic continued to grow strongly, up by 125% year on year, MTN said in a note to shareholders published before markets opened on Tuesday. Year-to-date capital expenditure came in at R18 billion, up just over 1% on a year ago. \nActive MTN Mobile Money customers increased by 10.6% over the second quarter to reach 19.8 millio. \nGroup CEO Rob Shuter said network investments in South Africa and Nigeria are “showing encouraging improvements in network quality and Net Promoter Scores”. \n“In South Africa, the prepaid business performed well and progress is being made in the post-paid segment, particularly in consumer post-paid where we now have positive net adds year to date,” Shuter said. \n“In Nigeria, our month-on-month gross connections have increased, and we experienced stable subscriber market share over the quarter while driving increased value share.” \nOn track \nHe said MTN is on track to meet its full-year guidance “despite continued challenging economic growth across our markets”. \nIn South Africa, subscriber numbers declined by 1% to 30.9 million, driven lower by prepaid, where there was higher churn following the withdrawal of a promotion in the second quarter. Post-paid subscriber numbers were stable. \n“The post-paid consumer segment recorded positive net additions in the quarter, demonstrating a continued encouraging recovery in this segment,” MTN said. “This was supported by improvements made in customer value management, increased channel footprint and enhanced churn management.” \nMTN Nigeria grew revenue by 11.2% (in constant currency terms), supported by a 5.4% growth in voice revenue and a 72.1% growth in data revenue. Subscriber numbers in this market declined by 5.2% to 50.3 million due to “modernisation of subscriber definitions”. \n“On a like-for-like basis, MTN Nigeria reported positive net additions and continued to gain value share in the quarter,” the group said. “To further drive subscriber growth, increasing the Sim registration footprint remains a priority.” \nMTN Irancell, in which MTN has a 49% stake, performed well thanks to a 64.5% growth in data revenue. The operation’s subscriber base expanded by 1% in the quarter. \nThis article was first published on TechCentral. To access the original, please click here .

      "text": "Pick n Pay has expanded its partnership programme with independent spaza store owners to the Western Cape. The programme's first spaza to be opened in the region came with the launch of Nozinga Market in Gugulethu on Monday morning. The spaza conversion programme modernises spaza stores to meet the needs of the customers and communities, is helping to build a new generation of modern retail entrepreneurs. This marks the launch of phase 2 of the partnership, combining the capability and systems of one of South Africas largest retailers with the spaza owners’ intimate knowledge of the needs of township customers to create a new shopping experience, grow township economies and boost employment.\nPick n Pay has worked with its suppliers to upgrade the store with new refrigeration and IT systems and it will stock 1,300 lines of edible and non-edible groceries, fresh produce and perishables. In addition to having a liquor licence, once approved, Nozinga Market will offer a full Value Added Service range, including money transfer, ticketing, airtime and data, bill payments, lottery tickets and the sale of prepaid electricity.\nImpacting lives of township entrepreneurs\nOwners of converted stores in Gauteng, where the programme was piloted last year, have reportedly performed well and their customers have benefited from a significantly expanded range of quality products at competitive prices, close to where they live.\nFor Gugulethu businesswoman Pumla Rudah, who calls herself a “born entrepreneur who was always trading this and that”, the opening of Nozinga Market has turned a burning ambition to own her own business into reality. Rudah left the corporate world in 2008 to follow her dream, trading pre-packed fruit in the informal market, before she turned to catering and then to helping other entrepreneurs to formalise their businesses.\nDespite these strong entrepreneurial roots, she says the training she’s received from Pick n Pay in preparation for the store opening has been a “great learning curve”, giving her new insights into owning and running a sustainable business. She has taken on 15 permanent staff, most of them from Gugulethu and Langa, and a share of her profits will go to the previous owners of the store, well-known traders in the area since the 1960s.\nA collaborative success\nThis collaborative effort between Pick n Pay, the Old Mutual Foundation, Masisizane Fund, Brimstone Legacy Fund, the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism and the City of Cape Town follows the success of the same model in Gauteng.\nPick n Pay deputy CEO Richard van Rensburg said: “We are delighted to be opening our first market store in the Western Cape. This very successful project is about creating the business leaders of the future. The success of the project lies in helping independent entrepreneurs stay independent, but even more successful with a range of trading and financial assistance.\n“Successful township businesses help the broader community by providing great services, creating jobs and building vital skills in technology, customer service, and more traditional retail areas such as learning to be butchers and bakers. We are helping independent entrepreneurs to make their businesses successful and play a greater role in growing our economy.”\nAlan Winde, Western Cape Minister of Economic Opportunities, said his department was “delighted to partner with Pick n Pay and local entrepreneurs in this programme”.\n“This is the kind of public-private collaboration we need to stimulate economies across the Western Cape, grow small businesses and create jobs. I am particularly encouraged by the support we are providing to new, independent store owners to enhance their business skills. This partnership shows the opportunities we can unlock when big business and emerging entrepreneurs work together. It’s an exciting model that holds a lot of promise for the future.”",

      "text": "CSR , News 0 \nVisa has marked the launch of the newly-incorporated Visa Foundation, which has been established as part of Visa’s larger social impact strategy that will prioritize the growth of micro and small enterprises around the world, enabling individuals, businesses, and economies to thrive. To mark its inception, the Visa Foundation is making its first financial commitment of up to US $20 million to Women’s World Banking. \nAt the heart of the Visa Foundation is the belief that micro and small enterprises are the backbone of the global economy. In fact, small and medium enterprises account for more than 90 percent of enterprises worldwide, and contribute 50-60 percent of global employment. However, these segments struggle to access the financial tools, capital and training programs required to enable them to fully thrive. The Visa Foundation’s core mission is to support efforts to rectify this imbalance. \n“As a brand and a business, Visa has always stood for making a positive and transformational impact on the world,” said Al Kelly, chief executive officer for Visa and Visa Foundation board member. “The Visa Foundation has been established to build on a long history of corporate giving and will accelerate the delivery of our social impact goals. Our intention is to establish a legacy of meaningful contributions by helping millions of microenterprises thrive.” \nWomen’s World Banking Support \nThe Visa Foundation’s first multi-year initiative will be a five-year, up to US $20 million grant to Women’s World Banking aimed at supporting millions of women-led small and micro enterprises. \nDespite their contribution to both the formal and informal economy worldwide, women-owned micro and small businesses are unserved or underserved financially. According to the World Bank there is a staggering $300 billion annual credit deficit for formal sector women-owned small and medium sized businesses. Financial products such as savings, credit and insurance can help low-income women to build their assets, grow their businesses, and ensure economic resilience in challenging times. \nWith the Visa Foundation’s support, Women’s World Banking will develop sustainable solutions for women entrepreneurs to build their enterprises and establish financial safety nets while also advancing leadership skills and financial capabilities. Over the next five years, the program will: Develop, test and scale innovative and sustainable products, that may include bundled financial services, business continuity insurance and technology-based solutions that drive positive financial behaviors Expand Women’s World Banking’s global network of partner financial service providers to effectively serve 50 million more financially underserved individuals Measure the impact that having access to improved financial services has on women enterprise owners Drive knowledge sharing, innovation and best practices within the global community on how to best support small and micro enterprises \nThe Visa Foundation grant is designed to support Women’s World Banking’s efforts around the world, with an initial focus in India, Mexico, Egypt and Nigeria, as key markets to drive growth among low-income, women-owned small enterprises. \n“Women and women-owned businesses continue to be disproportionately excluded from accessing formal financial services, impacting hundreds of millions of individuals with a significant effect on families and communities.” said Stephen Kehoe, Visa’s senior vice president for global financial inclusion, speaking at Women’s World Banking Making Finance Work for Women Global Summit in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania “By supporting measures to include women, there is a strong multiplier effect in terms of increased financial health for all. For this reason, the Visa Foundation chose to focus its first grant on women-owned enterprises and has selected Women’s World Banking as our first grant recipient.” \n“Women’s World Banking is thrilled to be Visa Foundation’s inaugural grantee. We share a vision to serve low-income women entrepreneurs whose contribution to economic growth is far below its potential,” said Mary Ellen Iskenderian, President and CEO of Women’s World Banking. “One billion women worldwide are unbanked, a significant number of them business owners. Through this partnership, we will deliver solutions that drive women’s access and usage of innovative financial services, so that they create economic opportunity for themselves and their families.” \nThe Visa Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Visa, works with charitable organizations to support underserved people and communities. As its central focus, the Visa Foundation is committed to helping low-income, financially underserved micro and small enterprises around the world to thrive and prosper. Post Views: 70",

Errors will be billed. \nMaynier said the minister should also focus on institutional vulnerability, with the autonomy of the Reserve Bank‚ the Public Investment Corporation and the Treasury all currently under threat. \nGigaba, who was not trusted‚ especially by the markets, needed to make a strong and unequivocal statement to the state capturers that he supported the independence of the Reserve Bank‚ PIC and Treasury, he said. \nThe fourth area of focus should be what DA deputy spokesman on finance Alf Lees termed zombiestate-owned enterprises, such as huge-loss-generating South African Airways. \nLees said that the finance minister would have no option but to provide for both an emergency bailout of SAA‚ totalling R5.2-billion, and a further R4.8-billion for working capital in the adjustments budget. \nThe fifth area of concern was long-term fiscal risks, such as the nuclear plan. \nMaynier said a Sunday Times report at the weekend that new Energy Minister David Mahlobo was appointed after a warning from the Russians to push the project through, “signals an intention to accelerate the programme‚ which is terrifying”. \nMahlobo made his maiden speech as energy minister at the Africa oil and gas conference in Cape Town last week, saying: “South Africa recognises the role of nuclear power in ensuring security of energy supply and meeting the challenge of climate change. \n“We promote an energy mix of coal‚ gas‚ renewables and nuclear. \n“Each of these options has their role: some of the energy sources are intermittent supply while others‚ such as nuclear and coal‚ are base-load supply.”. – TimesLIVE Related",

      "text": "India's water-logged farmers try out revamped flood insurance By Huizhong Wu MADHURPATTI, India, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When heavy rains swept through this village in northern Bihar in August and September, so much floodwater covered farmers' fields that it was difficult to tell one plot of land from another.“After the flood, when we went out to see the land there was nothing there,” said Babu Ram Rai, one Madhurpatti farmer. Rai and his neighbors - who farm a floodplain crisscrossed by rivers - are no strangers to flooding. But as climate change brings intensifying rainfall in South Asia, the floods are worsening and so is their destructive potential. In August and September, the heaviest rains in several years in Bihar killed 514 people and affected 17 million more, according to Bihar's state disaster management authority. Insurance policies for farmers could play a role in stemming the losses, experts say. But getting insurance right in India - from how fast help is delivered to how closely payouts match actual losses - has proved tricky. Now, however, a new flood insurance effort being tried in six villages in Bihar aims to bring greater accuracy and speed to assessing and compensating crop damage from flooding. The pilot project, backed by the Sri Lanka-based International Water Management Institute (IWMI), will insure 200 farmers for up to 5 million rupees ($78,000) in losses in total, with payouts made within a couple of months of a disaster.“What we’re trying to do is ... expedite the entire thing,” said Alok Sikka, IWMI’s representative in India. GROWING RISKS Between 2006 and 2015, the number of floods around the world increased but flood deaths dipped, particularly because of efforts to better prepare for such disasters in countries such as Bangladesh and China, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). In India, however, flood deaths increased over the same decade, with 90 floods killing 15,860 people, compared to 13,660 deaths from 67 floods in the previous decade, according to UNISDR data. In South Asia, floods have cost countries approximately $95 billion over the last 30 years. The economic damage has been particularly devastating for farmers in the region. Small-scale farmers represent close to 60 percent of the estimated 90 million rural households in India. A third of the country's farmers own less than half a hectare of land, or about one acre, according to government surveys. In normal years, these farmers can earn enough to feed their families and replant for the following season. But their thin margins makes them especially vulnerable to any kind of accident or disaster. Buying flood insurance is one way to cut the risks. But problems ranging from inaccurate damage assessments to delays in payments have plagued India's existing agricultural insurance efforts. For example, research by the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment found that information on crop damage often comes from local officials who file reports based on conversations or brief looks at affected areas, because they are unable to visit every farm. \"Sometimes there is a lack of resources... there are a lot of problems,\" said Vineet Kumar, a climate change programme officer at the research institute. At times government estimates of crop damage after a flood \"don't actually match the actual situation”, he said. It's not for lack of trying. The government has almost continually revised and updated insurance schemes since launching them in 1985. In Bihar, for example, the Indian government's 2016 Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna - the latest agricultural insurance effort - gives farmers payouts when certain weather triggers - such as rainfall levels - are reached. But the scheme does not always capture the true extent of flood damage, experts say. \"If you go by the weather-based insurance, it says there is average rainfall” even when the farmer’s fields are actually flooded, said Giriraj Amarnath, the lead scientist on the new IWMI insurance effort. SATELLITE DATA Under the new insurance programme, being carried out in collaboration with Bihar's government and private partners, including the Agricultural Insurance Company of India, expected damage to fields will be verified using satellite data and on-the-ground visits. The duration of a flood, and its depth, will then be compared to historical data and used to calculate a threshold for crop losses. If that threshold is passed, a farmer will receive compensation, Amarnath said. One of the biggest problems facing flood-hit farmers is that help - usually from government relief efforts - rarely comes fast enough to suit farmers, said Anil Sinha, a former vice chair of the Bihar State Disaster Management Authority who spent more than 30 years working as an Indian government administrator. Usually, after a flood, a team from the state and central government makes field visits to assess the damage. They then submit reports that go through a number of committees before the government approves the release of a payout.“By the time they come back, make the assessment, then that goes up to a cabinet subcommittee headed by the agricultural minister and finance minister … a lot of time has passed,” he said. Pushing some of that relief money into insurance could help, Amarnath believes. Right now, \"the government only spends post-flood, never pre-flood,\" he said. STILL SKEPTICAL Rai, the Madhurpatti farmer, said that in 2009 he paid an insurance premium of 600 rupees ($10) and received a payout of 18,000 rupees ($300) after losing the crop to floods. But the money came only the following year, he said - and he needed 50,000 rupees ($770) per hectare to plant again, including the cost of irrigating the land with diesel pumps. Farmers also can come to resent paying for insurance each year if they don't suffer losses.“I’ve registered for insurance three or four times,” Rai noted. \"But I only received a payout once.” The IWMI pilot project, which began in 2015, will make payouts for damage from the August and September flooding in November, Amarnath said. If the effort proves a success, partners hope to expand it and offer coverage to a million farmers in Bihar by 2025, said Amarnath of IWMI. His team also plans to run a similar pilot effort in Bangladesh, just across India's eastern border, where farmers also face annual floods. For now, however, some insured farmers remain skeptical of the new effort will bring real changes. \"We have to see ... how much it will actually benefit us\" Rai said.

      "text": "WELLINGTON. - - China has played an increasingly key role in the world and adopted new ways to promote economic integration as reflected in the Belt and Road Initiative, a New Zealand politician said. \nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Nigel Haworth, president of the New Zealand Labor Party, said the Belt and Road Initiative is an important way of looking at global integration economically. \n“We should all look at it very seriously and should engage with it constructively,” he said. \nThe Belt and Road initiative shows that China has started looking constructively at new ways of complementing the systems of economic integration, such as the World Trade Organization and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Haworth noted. \nProposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative aims to promote trade, financial integration, infrastructure inter-connectivity and people-to-people exchanges along and beyond the ancient Silk Road trade routes linking Asia with Europe and Africa. \nHaworth said that the lovely historical imagery about the Silk Road in the Belt and Road model forms a natural way in which China has captured its role in the global economy. \n“I think the world expects China to play its role and I think China is stepping up to that challenge seriously,” Haworth said. \nHis confidence in China’s role is also reflected in his congratulatory message to the Communist Party of China (CPC) on its 19th national congress, which opened Wednesday and will draw a blueprint for China’s development in the next five years and beyond. The CPC meeting is an important event, and it will not only chart a path for China’s economic growth and prosperity in the future, but also enhance the country’s influence on the world economy, he said in the message. \nSpeaking to Xinhua, Haworth, who is also an economics academic, observed that the Chinese development process since 1979 has been extraordinary in terms of economic growth and trading performance. He counted the number of ring roads in Beijing in his every visit to the Chinese capital. There were only three when he first visited the city in the early 1990s; now there are six functioning. \nCiting the country’s recent shift towards domestic redistribution and domestic consumption, Haworth said the Chinese economy has matured since the late 1970s, and the Chinese government is dedicated to engaging more people in the success of the economy. Although different in size, China and New Zealand are open to each other and talk to each other, and thus the two sides can learn from each other, said Haworth. \nHe added that bilateral cooperation opportunities are abundant, as China has experience in large infrastructure projects while New Zealand does well in small business innovation, as well as research and development in agriculture. New Zealand, he said, looks forward to talking to China on engaging with the Belt and Road Initiative in the long run. - Xinhua",

      "text": "Judith February | one hour ago \nFinance Minister Malusi Gigaba faces the greatest test of his short tenure as he delivers his first Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) on Wednesday. \nIn previous, more stable post-apartheid years, the MTBPS was largely an understated affair with a few tweaks made to the Budget. The entire process is aimed at ensuring maximum Budget transparency (something for which South Africa has been renowned) and provides an overview of income and expenditure over the next three years. It was a process built on painstaking number-crunching within the National Treasury and led first by Trevor Manuel at Finance, Nhlanhla Nene and Pravin Gordhan twice. Poor old Des Van Rooyen never had the chance to deliver his own MTBPS, his tenure was so short-lived. \nGigaba is President Zuma’s man. He has spent most of his time trying to fend off allegations that he has a close relationship with the Guptas and that he has facilitated state capture, specifically as Public Enterprises Minister. Leaving aside the near impossible economic conditions, Gigaba faces a crisis of confidence. After all, no compelling reasons were given as to why Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were axed. The incontrovertible conclusion to be drawn from Zuma’s unaccountable act was that Gordhan and Jonas stood as a bulwark to his state capture project. \nAdded to that, National Treasury and Sars have over the years held the line against excessive waste and corruption and have largely enjoyed the confidence of citizens and the broader business community. Theirs has been the mammoth task to provide accurate financial information and to make the trade-offs necessary to retain South Africa’s fiscal credibility. \nIf we are to meet our increasing social needs, proper economic management of finite resources is crucial to our country’s long-term stability and prosperity. \nThe raw economic facts are that Gigaba has little to work with. Projected 2017 growth figures will have to be adjusted downwards from 1.3% to somewhere around 0.5% or 0.6% as predicted by the IMF, World Bank and the South African Reserve Bank. The IMF cited ‘political uncertainty’ as one of the main reasons for this. Low growth inevitably means revenue targets will fall short. Analysts predict this might be by as much as R45 billion to R50 billion for 2017/2018. Might taxes then have to increase in February 2018? \nAnd then there is expenditure. Gordhan was committed to cutting wasteful expenditure but there has been slippage, most notably the R3 billion recent bailout of SAA. Add to that Eskom and other state-owned enterprises that are seen as ‘cash cows’ for those who would milk the state through corrupt tenders and the picture looks rather bleak. \nHow does Gigaba stop this endless cycle of expenditure, waste and corruption? After all, his predecessor was fired precisely for trying to bring about some discipline to the recklessness within SOEs. Furthermore, it is abundantly obvious from the recent logic-defying Cabinet reshuffle that Zuma is now relying on his ally, the inept David Mahlobo, to push through the nuclear deal. How will Gigaba deal with this pressure, one wonders, and the myriad other social spending pressures he will inevitably have to deal with such as #FeesMustFall and other developmental needs? \nIn 2016 Gordhan was clear about where he stood on the proposed nuclear deal. It is worth remembering Gordhan’s words during the 2016 MTBPS when he said, “further expansion of electricity generation capacity will be guided by the Integrated Resource Plan and the Integrated Energy Plan”. Eskom would take the lead in the nuclear power initiative, but work closely with National Treasury to ensure the programme was in the best interests of the country. \nGordhan then also issued a timely reminder that procurement should happen in terms of s217 of the Constitution and be “transparent”. He went on to add that, “Our approach to energy security and to meeting climate change commitments also includes a substantial renewable energy programme. Contrary to the views of some, these are sound and sensible long-term investments.” \nThe Zuma years have been extraordinary, not only for governance failures and corruption, but for the staggering mismanagement of the economy. The state has continuously and unwisely propped up failing SOEs and the debt to GDP ratio has ballooned from around 27% in 2008 to a predicted 53-55% in 2017. \nFrom Gigaba and his deputy Sifiso Buthelezi, himself also compromised, we have heard that South Africa may well consider approaching the IMF with a begging bowl to assist us in meeting our financial obligations. The duplicity of this is astounding. The same Cabinet members railing against ‘white monopoly capital’ are comfortable asking for loans from multi-national financial institutions? The irony is not lost on us. \nYet, how much lower could the Zuma government take us? We would in essence be borrowing to fund endless bailouts of SOEs choking on their own corruption and waste. It’s worth remembering that borrowing costs and creates a vicious cycle of dependency. And ultimately, the average citizen will have to pay for such folly. So this is what ‘radical economic transformation’ looks like, it would seem. \nAny Finance Minister needs credibility, a strong revenue collection service and an equally credible National Treasury. As part of his relentless assault on our democratic institutions, Zuma has made serious attempts to emasculate both Sars and National Treasury. It cannot be said that Sars commissioner Tom Moyane has not inserted himself into the previous conspiracy against Gordhan and himself has questionable links to the Guptas. \nGigaba has an uphill battle to convince us that he has the competence to steer South Africa’s economy. Is he prepared to salvage his tattered reputation by looking beyond his compromised boss who is, one way or the other, on his political deathbed, yet still desperately moving the chess pieces? \nJudith February is based at the Institute for Security Studies.

At 8:54 a.m. EDT (1254 GMT), the Canadian dollar was nearly unchanged at C$1.2643 to the greenback, or 79.10 U.S.cents. The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.2622,while it touched its weakest since Aug. 18 at C$1.2668. After back-to-back interest rate increases, the Bank ofCanada can stay on the sidelines for longer than firstanticipated, with tighter mortgage rules slowing the housingmarket and uncertainty about the North American Free TradeAgreement clouding the outlook for the economy. Chances of a rate increase this week have sunk to about 25percent from nearly 50 percent in mid-September, the overnightindex swaps market indicates. The central bank's policy rate sits at 1 percent. Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose after topexporter Saudi Arabia said it was determined to end a supplyglut. The price of U.S. crude was up 0.67 percent at $52.25a barrel. Bond yields in Europe and North America rose as data fromthe euro zone's top economies bolstered the case for theEuropean Central Bank to signal a sizeable cut this week to itsstimulus measures. Also underpinning bond yields, U.S. stock index futuresgained as investors digested earnings from a number of Dowcomponents. Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeperyield curve, with the two-year down 4 Canadian centsto yield 1.496 percent and the 10-year falling 28Canadian cents to yield 2.058 percent. The Canadian government will release its economic and fiscalupdate later in the day. After a smaller-than-expected budgetdeficit in the previous fiscal year and recent strong economicgrowth, analysts expect the government's finances to be in abetter position than it projected in its budget earlier thisyear.

One, for leaving the service without permission; he ran away from the country. And two, for the embarrassment he has brought to the government,” Adesina said, on Monday.",

To the best of my knowledge, he has not yet been arrested.” \nAnother source within the anti-graft agency was quoted as saying that Maina was moving around town in a bulletproof Range Rover Sports Utility Vehicle and other expensive vehicles. \nThe source said, “We have traced him to a hotel in Kaduna where he went to spend the weekend; we know that the DSS is protecting him and the DG DSS, deployed men to protect him. But make no mistake, we will arrest him, already we’ve frozen all his accounts.” \n“He stays in a property which is a DSS safe house. He moves around in a convoy of about two or three vehicles. I personally saw him alighting from a Range Rover SUV last week with about four DSS officials.”",

      "text": "Ernest Mabuza 0 Comment \nThe High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday hear an application by President Jacob Zuma to set aside the remedial action by former public protector Thuli Madonsela on alleged state capture. \nMadonsela released a report‚ titled State of Capture‚ in November last year concerning allegations of an improper relationship between Zuma‚ other state officials and the Gupta family. \nThe report recommended that‚ because Madonsela did not have enough funds to finalise the investigation‚ Zuma appoint a commission of inquiry to complete the investigation. \nMadonsela recommended that the commission be established by Zuma but that the presiding judge should be chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. \nZuma took issue with the remedial action and applied to court to have it reviewed and set aside. \nZuma believes the public protector has no right to tell him who should appoint a judge to head up the inquiry. \nZuma also asked for an order sending the State of Capture report back to the public protector for further investigation. \nIn his application filed in December last year‚ Zuma said the remedial action was unlawful as it went against the separation of powers doctrine. \n“The Public Protector is directing remedial action in areas in which the Constitution has left to the Executive‚” Zuma said. \nZuma said Section 84(2)(f) of the constitution provided that the president of the country was responsible for “appointing commissions of inquiry”. \nZuma said the public protector did not have the power to direct the chief justice to select a judge to head the judicial inquiry. \n“Again‚ this power can only be exercised by a President.” \nThe public protector had said Zuma could not decide who should chair the commission because he has a direct personal interest in the inquiry’s outcome. \n“The Public Protector observed on numerous grounds that the President may have violated his obligations to avoid a conflict of interest under section 2.3 of the Executive Ethics Code.” \nMadonsela’s successor‚ Busisiwe Mkhwebane‚ said her office had observed that Zuma may not have acted in line with his duty of professional ethics. \n“Section 96 of the Constitution accordingly precludes the President from retaining control over the commission‚ as he is alleged to have a direct personal or financial interest in the outcome of the commission‚” Mkhwebane said in her affidavit.

      "text": "ZUMA TAKES STATE CAPTURE REPORT TO COURT! By Sun Reporter Tuesday, October 24, 2017 08:49 ~ \nThe North Gauteng High Court is on Tuesday expected to hear President Jacob Zuma's application to review the remedial action contained in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. \nThe case has been set down for three days. \nNews24 previously reported that Zuma filed an application with the High Court to have Madonsela's report reviewed and set aside. \nHe said the former Public Protector had encroached on the role of the executive in her recommendations. \nMadonsela was looking into allegations of an improper relationship between the president and the influential Gupta family in relation to key appointments in Zuma's Cabinet and the awarding of contracts at state-owned enterprises. \nThe former Public Protector said she didn't have the necessary resources to finish her investigation into state capture and recommended a judicial inquiry, which was to be appointed by the President. \nHowever, she said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should be tasked with choosing a judge to head up the commission. \nDA federal chairperson James Selfe previously told News24 that the Nkandla judgment obliged Zuma to carry out remedial action unless it is set aside, and that was not done in this matter.",

Justice Abang was said to have signed the subpoena later on Monday. Jonathan is expected to appear before the court on Wednesday, October 25, 2017. \"I can authoritatively tell you that Metuh’s legal team filed the subpoena before the judge on Monday and the judge signed the subpoena promptly after the proceedings on Monday,\" a source told Punch. \"The judge indicated in the subpoena that the former President should appear in court on Wednesday. \"But whether or not the former President would appear in court on Wednesday would be dependent on if the court bailiff will be able to serve him at his home in Abuja between Monday and the end of Tuesday.\" Metuh is being tried over the 'shady' N400 million he received from the Office of the National Security Adviser in November 2014. ALSO READ : PDP says he’ll return N400M to show support for anti-corruption war It is believed that the money is part of the $2 billion arms deal, which the then NSA, Sambo Dasuki , alleged shared among PDP chieftains to fund Jonathan's presidential campaign in 2015. Most of Metuh's defence witnesses, including Mr. Ben Nwosu , who ended his testimony earlier on Monday, had insisted that the N400 million was directly authorised by Jonathan.

I don’t see him getting off the hook this time”, the source added. \n“The report does not favour any of those already indicted – the ministers and Maina himself. An investigation will also be carried out to ascertain level of connivance by other individuals and security agencies.” \n​A letter​ dated September 18 and signed by Mustapha L. Sulaiman for the FCSC chairman, indicated that the AGF ​directed the FCSC ​to ​re-absorb ​Maina​. \n​It read: “Kindly refer to the Attorney-General of the Federation/ Honourable Minister of Justice letter Ref. No. HAGF/FCSC/2017/ VOL. 1/3 dated 27th April 2017 requesting Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) to give consequential effect to the judgment that voided the warrant of arrest issued against A.A. Maina which formed the basis for the query and his eventual dismissal. \n“Further to the aforementioned letter, the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) at its meeting held on 14th June, 2017 deliberated on the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF’s) letter and requested the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHCSF) vide letter FC.4029/82/VOL.III/160 of 21st June 2017 to advise the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior to consider the AGF’s letter, the Officer’s case and make appropriate recommendation to the Commission. \n“The OHCSF accordingly advised the Ministry of Interior to consider the matter. The Ministry of Interior at its Senior Staff Committee (SSC)’s meeting held on 22nd June, 2017 considered the disciplinary case against the Officer and the letter by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice seeking the reinstatement of the Officer as a Director (Administration), SGL. 17 in the Federal Civil Service. \n“The Ministry of Interior’s Senior Staff Committee (SSC) deliberated on the case and recommended that Mr. Maina be reinstated into the service as Deputy Director. SGL. 16. The Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHCSF) vide letter Ref. No. HCSF/LU/ COR/ FCSC/749/III/ 135 dated 14th August 2017 forwarded the recommendations of the Senior Staff Committee (SSC) of the Ministry of Interior to the FCSC for further necessary action. \n“The FCSC at its meeting held on Wednesday, 16th August, 2017 considered the letter from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and the recommendations of the Senior Staff Committee (SSC) of the Ministry of Interior on the disciplinary case against Alhaji Abdulrasheed Abdullahi Maina, Deputy Director (Administration), Salary Grade Level 16. \n“The FCSC, thereafter, approved the reinstatement of the Officer into the Service with effect from 21st February, 2013 (being the date he was earlier dismissed from Service). \n“The FCSC also approved for the Officer to sit for the next promotion examination to the Post of Director (Administration), SGL. 17.” \nMinister of Interior, Abdulrahman Dambazzau, had in a statement by his press secretary, Ehisienmen Osaigbovo, ​confirmed that the ex-fugitive was ​”​posted few​ ​to the Ministry of Interior by the Office of the Head of Service on an Acting capacity to fill a vacancy created following the retirement of the Director heading the Human Resources Department in the Ministry”. \nThe minister said Maina’s recall was on the orders on the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation and the Federal Civil Service Commission. \nHe said the two bodies are responsible for “issues relating to Discipline, Employment, Re-engagement, Posting, Promotion and Retirements of Federal Civil Servants.” \n“It is understood that Maina’s last posting was with the Ministry of Interior, and that is probably why he was re-posted back to the Ministry,” the statement added. \nIn 2012, Maina was accused of a massive pension fraud scheme amounting to more than N100 billion. \nMaina was invited by the Senate Joint Committee on Public Service and Establishment and State and Local Government Administration, which upon completion of its investigation issued a Warrant of Arrest against him. \nMaina thereafter sued the Senate and the then Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar. \nHe went into hiding (reportedly in the United Arab Emirates) after being declared wanted by the police.",

      "text": "University of Cape Town (UCT) vice-chancellor Max Price has expressed “grave concern” that President Jacob Zuma has not yet released the fees commission report.\nA statement from UCT appealing for the release of the report came late on Monday following the shutdown of the university’s main library by a group of protesters.\nThe statement is the first direct public message to Zuma from a university that presses for the fees report to be released amid deepening fears that campuses and families are unable to sufficiently prepare their finances for the 2018 academic year.\nUCT said it would normally have finished consultations on fees with its student representative council (SRC) in September, but has been unable to do so without the instructions of the fees report.\n“However, not wanting to pre-empt the recommendations of the fees commission we have delayed decisions on fees pending the release of the report,” said Price.\nZuma established the Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training (fees commission) in January 2016. The commission was tasked with investigating the feasibility of free education in South Africa. Its report landed on Zuma’s desk on August 31, and had since been shrouded in secrecy.\nIn the past two months, many universities have been left to wait, sweating out the looming stress as many have resolved they cannot plan their 2018 budget without knowing what the report will say.\nIn Cape Town, Stellenbosch University has been unable to wait. It has announced an 8% fee increase for the 2018 year. But its SRC has rejected that increase , saying it will exclude poor black students.\nThe University of the Free State (UFS) has already been shutdown by student protesters, but resolving fees disputes may be difficult without the report or any feedback from the government on the next year. By this time last year, the higher education ministry had already told universities about the government’s higher education budget for the next academic year.\nThe University of Witwatersrand (Wits) is meanwhile trying to plan its own finances, but told the Mail & Guardian : “[It’s] not meaningful without knowledge of the recommendations of the report”.\nThe instability in the higher education ministry may now be exacerbated by Zuma’s surprise Cabinet reshuffle 7 days ago, which saw higher education minister Blade Nzimande axed. Nzimande’s removal came at a time when universities would ordinarily financially prepare for the year ahead as the academic year comes to a close.\nIn an interview with City Press , the former minister said not even he had seen Zuma’s tightly held fees commission report before he was sacked. He said his removal as higher education minister paved the way for Zuma to credit someone else for the report.\n“I thought that it would be obvious that he will call me and say: ‘Here is the report. What are your views on it before I respond?’ The president never gave me the report. I don’t know about it,” he said.\nPrice’s statement squarely puts the blame on government if university finances should go awry in the coming months or year. Already, he said, UCT is underfunded and its student body and parents will need to know what the next year will hold.\n“We will not be able to delay decisions on fees for much longer. We, therefore, appeal to the President to release the report for public scrutiny and debate,” he said.\nRa'eesa Pather Ra’eesa Pather is a general news journalist with the Mail & Guardian’s online team.

      "text": "You are here » Home » Opinion Why those prescribing ‘boardroom’ democracy for us are dead wrong By Kipchumba Murkomen | Published Mon, October 23rd 2017 at 09:52, Updated October 23rd 2017 at 09:56 GMT +3 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share on Twitter \nThere has recently been a chorus of calls by sections of the diplomatic missions in Kenya who have variously been quoted asking President Uhuru Kenya to negotiate the issue of the Kenyan presidency with the NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and reach a settlement. \nThe President would be ill-advised to succumb to such reckless calls as they would not only be contemptuous of the Supreme Court of Kenya that ruled on Presidential Election Petition Number 1 of 2017 that ordered the IEBC to conduct a fresh Presidential Election in strict conformity with the Constitution and the applicable election laws within 60 days of the determination, but it would also offend Article 136 of the constitution of Kenya 2010 that requires the President to be elected by registered voters in a national election conducted in accordance with the Constitution and any Act of Parliament regulating presidential elections. \nALSO READ: Exhortation to rise against second-rate democracy in Kenya \nSovereignty \nThe supreme law of Kenya underlines the sovereignty of the Kenyan voter to choose his leaders through a clearly defined electoral process. Neither the Constitution of Kenya 2010 nor any Acts of Parliament regulating presidential elections in Kenya have any provisions that provide for ‘negotiations’ as an alternative method to be used for choosing the holder of the office of President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya. \nThere have also not been any amendments to our statutes that have replaced the Kenyan voter, being the legally prescribed appointing authority, with ‘Foreign Diplomats’, ‘NASA Principals’ or ‘Jubilee Party Negotiators’ thereby according them powers to appoint the President through negotiations. In my considered view, it would actually require a referendum as stipulated in Article 255(1)(c) of the constitution of Kenya 2010 to remove the right of the Kenyan Voter to exercise his sovereign right to choose his leaders and confer such right to a team of negotiators. It is inconceivable that the voters would vote themselves out of such a right. \nLegally enlightened \nIt should also be noted that Kenyans have become very legally enlightened with heightened awareness of their rights and any attempts to appoint a President or Prime Minister through negotiation or any other processes outside the provisions of the constitution would be met with fast and furious litigation and wouldn’t see the light of day. The path therefore of negotiated or boardroom democracy that our foreign friends are leading us towards constitutes an illegality that is not only dangerous but does not conform to the rule of law. \nDangerous trend \nThis prescription of ‘boardroom democracy’ is not good for our country. It is giving rise to a very dangerous trend that if left unchecked and allowed to take root in Kenya will surely replace democracy or majoritarian rule as we know it today. It is a trend akin to ‘Tyranny of the Minority’ whereby a losing presidential candidate and his minority reject the election results using violence, mass action, bedlam and chaos to such a scale that threatens the very fabric of the state making it ungovernable and holding the majority ransom in a deadlock that they only purpose to unlock through negotiated democracy resulting into their accommodation in government. The country then ends up getting the leaders they did not vote into office thereby desecrating our democracy. \nHistory repeating itself? \nALSO READ: What Supreme Court ruling means for future \nThe chaos is often carefully designed, planned and choreographed to quickly degenerate into a humanitarian and economic crisis that immediately attracts the attention of the international community, civil society and even the majority to seek a short term solution to put out intentionally lit fires to enable the country to move on. \nThis is a game that the NASA Principals understand very well having been its beneficiaries in 2007 when both Raila, Kalonzo, Wetangula and Mudavadi were all beneficiaries of the 2008-2013 Nusu-Mkate government which richly gifted them with the last jobs they ever held in government. Raila became Prime Minister and enjoyed all the trappings of a co-presidency. \nKalonzo was named Vice President by then President Kibaki to shore up PNU numbers while Musalia Mudavadi was appointed to the plum position of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Local Government. Moses Wetangula was appointed Minister for Foreign affairs as a reward for his role in the PNU negotiation panel. Those were surely the nostalgic good all days that the quartet would wish to relive at the expense of our democracy. \nBut my greatest misgiving with this prescription is that; There would be no need for us to go to elections if such elections do not result in respect for the choice and decision of the electorate. \nGullible international community \nThat despite being rejected by the electorate, a losing candidate can marshal his supporters and make enough noise, barricade roads, throw tantrums and demonstrate causing a crisis designed to overturn the election result and then triggering a gullible international community to intervene and support them to overturn the sovereign will of the Kenyan people. \nThe diplomatic missions must allow the rule of law and respect for our institutions to prevail. It is for this reasons that there shall be no negotiated presidency in Kenya. The October 26th Elections must proceed as scheduled. \nMr Murkomen is the Senator, Elgeyo-Marakwet County RELATED TOPICS:",

Picture: Cindy Archillies/EWN \nJOHANNESBURG – The South African Communist Party (SACP) in KwaZulu-Natal has called on African National Congress Members of Parliament who want to stop Parliament’s probe into state capture to be recalled. \nThe communist party held a briefing in Durban on Monday afternoon to share the outcomes of a special meeting held over the weekend after the sudden axing of general secretary Blade Nzimande . Related AMA resilience team,100RC & Dalberg tour Achimota waste transfer station \nThe SACP says the latest Cabinet reshuffle was driven by personal differences between the president and Nzimande who has been critical of the influence of the Gupta family. \nKZN SACP secretary Themba Mthembu said: “We’re shocked to hear that some ANC MPs are fighting the ANC caucus on the investigation of state capture. These are the people who claim to be our representatives in the National Assembly but acting against the wishes and concern of the majority. These are the MPs who deserve to be recalled.” \nMthembu said: “The challenges that the ANC is facing right now, need the SACP – together with the members of the ANC – to confront them.” Related SA Weather Service warns of severe thunderstorms \n‘WEAPON AGAINST NZIMANDE’ \nThe SACP in KwaZulu-Natal says the failure of President Jacob Zuma to release the Fees Must Fall report to the now axed Higher Education Minister Nzimande, shows that there has been a breakdown in their relationship. \nAfter President Zuma’s announcement of a Cabinet shake-up, the SACP immediately described the removal of Nzimande as a direct attack on the Communist Party. \nThe KZN SACP’s Themba Mthembu says this does not mean there are plans to turn their back on the ANC-led alliance just yet. \nBut Mthembu says there has always been an attempt to undermine SACP aligned ministers.",

The Kogi-West lawmaker took a swipe at the attorney general of the federation, Abubakar Malami. He said, \"I want to ask this question to the executive; should we continue in sin and ask grace to abound? Time after time, the AGF and minister of justice have abuse this office. We are not talking about Maina. We should talk about the integrity of the AGF and minister of justice. \"That is the chief lawmaker. If the law officer has his hands stained, then the entire nation is one a stained. Something happened that we have not noticed, two public officers quarreled, the IGP and Senator Misau by the interpretation of what the attorney general did, he chose to pick a public officer over the other. When did IGP become synonymous to FG. \"The attorney general is only to prosecute in public interest hoe does an individual become a public interest but because we have condoled impunity. A senator as arraigned in court. If I commit an offence against the friend of the AGF I would also be arraigned. Mr president is good man and he means well but he is surrounded by cankerworms and caterpillars. \"We would continue to deliberate like this until we stand up on behalf of the people into his country. We should have the audacity to take strong decisions. \"Nigerians would understand why the office of AGF and minister of justice is separated. We must recommend to the president that the AGF has displayed gross incompetence for the office he is occupying. The man would run us into a constitutional crisis if we don't check it on time,\" he added. Tweet Do you ever witness news or have a story that should be featured on Pulse Nigeria?

      "text": "11 minutes ago General Sun News 2 From: Eniola Oyemolade, Ibadan The All Progressives Congress (APC), in Oyo State, on Tuesday, slammed a former President of the Senate, Chief Adolphous Wabara, over his recent assertion that the People Democratic Party (PDP) would reclaim the state in 2019. The APC, in a statement issued in Ibadan by its Public Relations Officer, Mr. Olawale Sadare, said the assertion would never come to reality and would remain in the realm of dream. Wabara had, in an interview with journalists at the Premier Hotel, Ibadan, during the collation of results of ward congresses of PDP held in Oyo State, on Sunday, said he did not have any doubt about PDP ‘grabbing power’ in Oyo State and at the national level, adding that the electorate would help the party to achieve the goal. Members of the party, according to him, have rebranded themselves and have changed positively, saying no one should be afraid of the same faces they had known PDP with, adding that the faces might be the same, but “We have learnt our lessons. We will show people that we have repented. The electorate want to see a changed character. But we must ensure a level playing field to make it.” But Sadare, in the statement by APC, described the remarks as ‘delusional and insensitive.’ He said: “Chief Adolphous Wabara only succeeded in fooling a few members of the PDP faction, which played host to him on Saturday during a purported party Ward Congress, which ended in a fiasco as expected. He felt a need to play the ostrich after the reality had dawned on him that his party (PDP) could not be salvaged again particularly in the pacesetter state. “However, the only way which Wabara’s statement could come to fruition is if the scandalous circumstance that produced him as the President of the Nigerian Senate in 2003, and made his two year reign to be characterized by myriads of upheavals in the Upper Chamber, could be re introduced into the polity by the same rejected PDP elements. “Which PDP was Wabara relying upon for the magic of victory in 2019 general election? Is it the one that has been killed and buried by the patriotic electorate but whose ghost some failed politicians are only trying to invite with a view to using it to further unleash their political terrorism on the populace? Or is it the same PDP under which the people of Abia State, where Wabara comes from, are currently gnashing their teeth on account of bad governance? “As a matter of fact, the little hope which the hitherto re-alignment efforts to re-launch the PDP in Oyo State had produced was completely murdered last Saturday during the purported Ward Congress as witnessed by the Wabara-led team when the party hijackers in Senator Rashidi Ladoja and his Accord Party cabal truncated the whole process and left other stakeholders in total disarray.”",
