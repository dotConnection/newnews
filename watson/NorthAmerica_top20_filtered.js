More >>  31   This   \nBy MICHAEL BIESECKERAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the   Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips",

      "text": "Marketing Can RFS biofuel and ethanol mandates help push corn prices higher? It looks like this will be the fourth consecutive year with world stocks above 200 MMTs and \"stocks-to-use\" at a very comfortable 20%. Oct 23, 2017 \nCorn bulls remain disappointed as the market teeters near contract lows, finding it difficult as of late to stay steadily above $3.50 per bushel. Insiders are saying slightly better than expected U.S. yields and the recent failed negotiations surrounding NAFTA have kept the upside limited. \nOn a positive note, many inside the ag industry were happy last week to see President Trump backing the RFS biofuel and ethanol mandates. From a traditional fundamental perspective, I continue to hear talk that U.S. ending stocks could eventually push north of +2.5 billion bushels. \nIn addition, it looks like this will be the fourth consecutive year with world stocks above 200 MMTs and \"stocks-to-use\" at a very comfortable 20%. Meaning both fundamentals domestically and globally remain burdensome and oversupplied, especially if you factor in the fact the U.S. yield might still work itself a hair higher. The past couple of weeks the USDA has shown improvements in their crop condition estimate, which now stands at 65% rated \"Good-to-Excellent\". \nThe U.S. harvest was reported at 28% complete vs. 47% on average. Like most, I suspect we start to see more harvest activity during the next three weeks. But there are still some extremely wet areas, so I have to image this harvest is going to be late and continue to stay late... I've also been hearing more talk and concerns about \"quality\" problems as the harvest progresses. Several producers I know have had to swallow some fairly sizable deductions on delivers and have even had several loads flat out rejected. \nThe moisture levels are certainly creating some problems, especially with extremely low margins, limited working capital, and producers electing to leave corn in the fields not wanting to spend the money to dry it down. \nBesides the \"quality\" of the U.S. crop, I also continue to keep a close eye on South American weather, which arguably seems to be improving a bit in the days ahead, longer-term however it's still a major uncertainty. As a producer, I'm staying extremely patient and keeping hedges in places. As a spec, I still think there is more nearby room to the downside.",

Andrea Helms said she works hard by herself, to care for her daughter and 2 month old son. But, it's hard to make ends meet. \n\"It's tight. The budget's tight,” Helms said earnestly. “I live off a fixed income, get paid once a month. The budget's tight, but I make it work.\" \nThat's why she's one of 145,000 Hoosiers who get monthly food benefits from the state's FOOD program for women and children. \n\"Basically, WIC covers almost all of our needs, especially for Jesus' milk,” Helms said as she held her infant son. \nShe said often, when she's grocery shopping, things can get a little confusing about what foods are WIC approved. \n\"Or I have to ask the lady at the checkout, or I have to stop and call my card, and enter my card number and wait to hear all the prompt,” Helms said. \nStarting Monday, the Indiana Department of Health said you can download their new smartphone app. It will allow users to scan food barcodes at the stores and instantly see what's approved. It's all part of a $1.2 Million Federal Grant, and WIC Director Eldon Whetstone says this is a first in the Midwest. \nEldon Whetstone, WIC’s Executive Director explained \"It puts the power of WIC in the clients hands. They can tell exactly what they have left on their card for that month, where they can use it, and what items they can purchase.\" \n\"That would be great!” Helms explained. “To be able to have that app and check that out before you go to the store.” \nHelms said this app will save her time and money. \nWIC’s Director, Whetstone, said you can download the app now, in the Apple and Google Play Stores. \nHe said the Department is staggering rollout across the state, a handful of counties at a time.He also said look for a text message from WIC between now and Thursday for your area. \nThe whole state should be able to use it by the end of this week. \nFor more information, or to apply for WIC services can call 1-800-522-0874, email inwic@isdh.in.gov or click here \nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

      "text": "0 \nAllen P. Osmundson, 81, of Glen Ullin, formerly of Fergus Falls, Minnesota, passed away Sunday, Oct. 15, 2017 at Sanford Health in Bismarck, North Dakota. \nA memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday, Oct., 29, 2017 at Faith Lutheran Church in Dwight, North Dakota. \nAllen Paul Osmundson was born June 24, 1936 in Breckenridge, Minnesota, to Art and Palma Osmundson of Dwight. He graduated from Wahpeton High School and then went to the North Dakota State College of Science. He served in the military. Allen was in the Army National Guard for two years and the U.S. Army for three years. While in the Army he drove truck until he received his sharpshooter medal. He was then employed as a shooting instructor. From there he became Military Police and was stationed in Honolulu, Hawaii. \nWhile in Hawaii, he met Patricia Maile Sylva. He received an honorable discharge and came home to North Dakota where they were married Oct. 31, 1958 in Dwight. Their son, Curtis, was born Sept. 7, 1959. \nFor several years, Al had his own apiary, where he produced honey and other bee products. He lived in North Dakota for many years and was known as “the bee man.” He also lived in South Dakota, Minnesota, Louisiana,and Texas. During these years he drove truck for other beekeepers. Later in life he lived in Fergus Falls where he could be closer to his son Curtis and his wife Milly, and his granddaughter, Ellie. \nOne thing Al may be remembered for is he didn’t know a stranger. He was friendly and liked to visit with everyone. He also enjoyed hunting and fishing. He liked to watch the Minnesota Twins baseball or boxing on TV. \nHe is preceded in death by his parents, Art and Palma; a special aunt, Olga Paulson; his brother, Lyle Osmundson; and his nephew Corey. \nHe is survived by his son, Curtis (Milly); granddaughter, Ellie (Jesse) Tomford; great-grandson, Liam, sister-in-law, Carol Osmundson; nephew Jeff (Pam) Osmundson and family; and niece Kimbra (Dave) Amerman and family. \nBlessed be the memory of Allen Osmundson. \nStevenson Funeral Home & Crematory in Dickinson is in charge of the arrangements.

      "text": "US, California approve fix for 38,000 Volkswagen diesels Dee-ann Durbin, Ap Auto Writer Updated 5:17 pm, Monday, October 23, 2017 \nDETROIT (AP) — Federal and state officials said Monday they have approved a fix for 38,000 Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche sport utility vehicles with diesel engines that were cheating on emissions tests. \nThe approval brings German automaker Volkswagen AG closer to resolving a costly and embarrassing scandal that began two years ago, when the company admitted that more than 550,000 vehicles in the U.S. — and 11 million worldwide — were designed to cheat on emissions tests. The vehicles have software that turns on emissions controls during testing but turns them off in everyday driving. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board had to approve the fix under a $1.2 billion settlement approved by a federal judge this spring. The most recent fix applies to 3-liter diesels in 2013-2016 models of the Volkswagen Touareg and Porsche Cayenne and the 2015 Audi Q7. \nVolkswagen will contact owners about the fix. Dealers will update the software in all of the vehicles and modify hardware in some of them for free. Owners also will receive compensation of between $7,039 and $16,114. \nOnce complete, Volkswagen will have repaired or bought back most of the U.S. diesels involved in the scandal. \nHere what you need to know about the Volkswagen fix: \n— The 3-liter diesels are among the last of the vehicles Volkswagen must repair in the U.S. \n— Last year, the company agreed to a nearly $15 billion settlement that required it to buy back or fix 475,000 2-liter diesel cars in the U.S. \n— Volkswagen must still get approval for a 3-liter diesel fix in some versions of the Audi A6, A7 and A8 sedans and the Q5 SUV. \n— It has already paid out more than $23 billion in U.S. fines and settlement costs and last month, it announced a $3 billion charge for buying back and retrofitting the 2-liter diesels. \n— Volkswagen could have been on the hook for as much as $4 billion in vehicle buyback costs if the most recent fix hadn't been approved by the EPA and California. \n— Not all of the 3-liter diesels Volkswagen sold in the U.S. can be fixed. The automaker was required to buy back around 20,000 older vehicles with 3-liter diesels from the 2009-2012 model years because they couldn't be repaired to meet pollution standards. Those owners also received compensation ranging from $7,755 to $13,880. \n— The scandal has caused Volkswagen to rethink its diesel strategy and invest more in electric vehicles. It now plans to introduce more than 30 electric-powered vehicles by 2025 and sell 2 to 3 million of them per year. It's also spending $2 billion to build electric charging stations in the U.S. as part of its settlements with the U.S. and California.",

      "text": "HONG KONG – Hong Kong’s highest court freed pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law on bail Tuesday pending an appeal of their prison sentences after they were convicted of sparking massive protests in 2014.\nThe two were granted bail by the Court of Final Appeal, according to a post on their political party’s Facebook page and local media reports.\nIn August, the two were given prison sentences for their involvement in an unlawful assembly that kicked off the “Umbrella Movement” protests.\nThe two had been originally been given more lenient sentences that allowed them to avoid prison but the justice secretary requested that the courts review those punishments.\nThe move sparked fears that authorities were undermining the semiautonomous Chinese city’s independent judiciary, underlining concerns among residents that Beijing is clamping down on dissent.\nFollowing the review, Wong, 21, was given six months and Law, 24, received eight months. They were among student leaders who spearheaded the protests against Beijing’s decision to restrict elections, which brought major thoroughfares in Hong Kong to a standstill for 79 days.\nLocal broadcaster RTHK reported that Judge Geoffrey Ma required each to post 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,400) for their bail, surrender their travel documents and report to police once a week. Their appeals will be heard Nov. 7.\nDozens of supporters and a large press pack waited outside the courthouse for the pair to appear.\nWong gained fame for his prominent role in the Hong Kong protests while still a teenager. Law was elected last year to the legislature, becoming the city’s youngest-ever lawmaker, and then was disqualified from office after a government legal challenge over irregularities in his oath.\nA third student leader, Alex Chow, who was also convicted and imprisoned in the same case is not appealing.",

      "text": "Posted Oct 23, 2017 10:30 pm EDT Last Updated Oct 23, 2017 at 11:00 pm EDT \nWASHINGTON – White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says chief of staff John Kelly doesn’t need to apologize to Florida congresswoman Frederica Wilson. \nWilson had accused President Donald Trump of being insensitive during a telephone conversation last week with the widow of a U.S. service member killed in Niger. \nKelly defended Trump and criticized Wilson, accusing the Democrat of taking credit during a 2015 speech for getting federal funding for an FBI field office in Florida. \nVideo of the speech contradicts Kelly’s recollection. Female members of the Congressional Black Caucus called on Kelly to apologize to Wilson. \nSanders — questioned about the matter at a forum Monday with White House reporters — says she didn’t think Kelly was wrong “and therefore I don’t think he should offer an apology.”",

Fallin says she left once the area was given the all clear from the storm. \nThe casino reportedly suffered damage from water and debris, but there are no reports of injuries.

Cardwell says when the children were sent to art class with their mouths taped shut, the staff took immediate action.\"The art teacher did an awesome job of going to the principle and involving him\"\"When a personnel issue is involved, we can't discuss specifics. but I do know we take things very seriously regarding any staff member, whether it's a custodian, teacher, principle or substitute teacher. and we will investigate if any issues arise\" says Dr. Mark Baker, the school's superintendentSince the mother of one of the children involved decided that her daughter was not really harmed by this and that the school did a great job handling the situation, her and her family have decided to not press charges.Although she is relieved her child wont have to be under this substitute teacher's care again, there is still some concern.\"I am just wanting to ensure that this gentleman doesn't substitute for any of our children in any of our local areas I was told by Carthage R9 that he was removed as a substitute option. But we also have Joplin and we also have Webb City, Carl Junction, Sarcoxie. this gentleman, I don't think he is a violent man. but I think he made one of the most horrible decisions he possible could\" says Cardwell. \nThe substitute teacher was removed before the day was even over.",

      "text": "Father of son accused of stabbing siblings to death calls attack 'complete shock' Krystyna Biassou, KUSA 10:10   Malik Vincent Murphy, 19 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nKUSA - The father of the 19-year-old charged in the stabbing deaths of his 5-year-old sister and 7-year-old brother released a statement to the media on Monday calling the teen \"loving\" and \"accommodating.\" \nMalik Murphy is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the Colorado Springs killings. He was arrested on Oct. 17 at 912 Carlisle St. after the attacks on sister Sophia and brother Noah. \nMalik Murphy’s 5-year-old sister Sophia and 7-year-old brother Noah died at the hospital, according to Colorado Springs Police. (Photo: Family) \n\"Prior to this event, Malik never demonstrated any suspicious or threatening behavior towards his siblings,\" the statement from the Murphy family read in part. \"We are a very close knit family that did everything together, which is why this has been a complete shock.\" \nMalik is also accused of stabbing his dad, Jefferson Murphy, in the neck during a scuffle. Jefferson Murphy has since been released from the hospital. \n“[Malik] never raises his voice,” Marcus Mason previously told 9NEWS. Mason is Malik's uncle. “He was caring to his siblings, he wasn't a mean brother to them. He really wasn't. He helped out and even that evening they were playing together in the yard, with a football, throwing the football around. He's playing with his siblings.” \nRELATED: Uncle remembers 'sweet kids' allegedly killed by their older brother \nSophia and Noah were laid to rest on Monday. \nMurphy is being held without bond at the El Paso County jail. His next court date is October 27. \nRead the family's entire statement below: \nWe would first like to thank God for his love and strength during this horrific time for our family. No family is ever prepared to handle the death of a child; let alone two children, in such a manner. We wish to thank all of our family, friends, church, and the entire community for their outpouring of support, sympathy, and love following the terrible tragedy that took the lives of our precious Noah and Sophia. The senseless attack that took place early Tuesday morning was completely unprovoked and took place when the entire family was sleeping. Prior to this event, Malik never demonstrated any suspicious or threatening behavior towards his siblings. Malik was a loving, also accommodating, and supportive brother and son. We are a very close knit family that did everything together, which is why this has been a complete shock. \nAs we search for answers and peace, we ask for your patience, love, and prayers as we delicately navigate our way forward in our new reality. It is all of the phone calls, texts messages and social media posts that bring us comfort and help us to get through each day. Please know that we have received them and are responding to them as quickly as we can. We sincerely appreciate all the help we have received thus far and all of the offers we have received to help. It has filled our heart with such love and appreciation from all the outpouring of love and prayers from a community we have only lived in, as a family, for three years. God bless you and we will be putting out a formal statement in the coming weeks. \nThe family wants to thank the community for their support. Here’s a place you can still help them. \n© 2017 KUSA-TV",

Carlile also contributed to “When War Comes Home,” a documentary about how war affects families. \nThe organization will hold two similar events in Indianapolis next week as well: one Wednesday at the Lincoln Square Pancake House and one Thursday at the Fort Harrison Veterans Center. Each event will have a different guest speaker. \nSince the Tuesday event is in Anderson, the focus will be on resources available in Madison County, said Buzz Smith, veteran resource navigator at Easterseals Crossroads. Making sure the veterans are in the Veterans Affairs system and receiving proper benefits will be part of the event as well. \nSmith said the organization holds what it calls rally point events that are essentially veterans resource fairs. However, he said it’s important to have an event specifically focused on women veterans. \n“We feel that female veterans really don’t get enough press or glory,” he said. “We just don’t think they are recognized as much as the male veteran counterparts. Basically that’s what this is — a recognition and thank you.” \nIf you go \nWhat: Event for women veterans \nWhen: 8:30 to 11 a.m. Tuesday \nWhere: Salvation Army, 1615 Meridian St., Anderson. \nCost: Free and includes breakfast Tags",

      "text": "Our friends at Rotoworld were pretty quick to bury Peters saying, ” It’s almost surely a season-ending injury for the 35-year-old.” Thanks for the positive vibes, guys! October 23, 2017 at 11:53 pm \nEagles fans, REDSKINS players showed a lot of class during this unfortunate play. \nNo ESPN you can leave the lame snowballs at Santa alone tonight. We (league) lost a good one……respect. October 23, 2017 at 11:56 pm \nSince the question came up… the Bills received three draft picks in the Peters trade, a 1st & 4th in 2009 & a 6th in 2010, which they used on Eric Wood, Shawn Nelson & Danny Batten, respectively. Nelson and Batten didn’t pan out, but Wood has been a starter on the OL for his entire career and was a Pro Bowl center in 2015. Given that Peters wanted out of Buffalo at the time, the trade was probably a win for both teams. bird2urmother says: \nBoysroll, skins-cowboys should be a good one next week. Dont get ahead of yourself, there. Youre not playing the 9ers again next week. Leave a Reply",

Some of those have ended up in my books, like Indigo and Anjali 's stories. 'Time', the story below, by 11-year-old Viddy Boon is one of those extraordinary pieces. He manages to capture a lifetime and say something profound in so few words, while leaving much for discussion. I think it's an articulate and eloquent story that a writer of any age could be proud of. I hope you enjoy it. Time He had been given the watch on his tenth birthday. It was an ordinary grey plastic wristwatch in every respect except for the fact that it was counting down. 'That is all the time you have in the world son, use it wisely.'And indeed he did. As the watch ticked away, the boy, now a man, lived life to the fullest. He climbed mountains and swam oceans. He talked and laughed and lived and loved. The man was never afraid for he knew exactly how much time he had left. Eventually the watch began its final countdown. The old man looked over everything he had done, everything he had built. 5. He shook hands with his old business partner. 4. His dog came and licked his hand earning a pat on the head for his companionship. 3. He hugged his son, knowing he had been a good father. 2. He hugged his wife. 1. The old man smiled and closed his eyes.Then, nothing happened. The watch beeped once and turned off. The man stood there very much alive. You would think that in that moment he would have been overjoyed. Instead, for the first time in his life, the man was scared. By Vidwaan Boon, age 11. SHARE:",

      "text": "You are at: Home »   » Archbishop Gomez Issues a Challenge to Youth Archbishop Gomez Issues a Challenge to Youth   , Faith Resources Pixabay (2016), CC0 Public Domain \nWith the new school year beginning, in recent weeks I have had the blessing to celebrate Mass at some of our Catholic high schools. \nHigh school is such a great time in life. It is a time when young people start really thinking about how they are going to live. What am I going to do for a job? Who will I marry? Will I find the right person? Where am I going to live? This is the time when some begin to wonder if God is calling them to be a priest or to be consecrated in religious life. \nSometimes I think we get stuck because we ask the wrong questions. We ask: What do I want out of my life? But we need to remember that life is not about us. The better question is always: What does God want out of my life? Why did he make me ? \nAnd the answer that I talk to young people about is that we are all born to be saints. We are all born to find Jesus and to follow him. And when we follow him, we discover the meaning of our lives. \nOf course, this takes some convincing — with young people as well as with adults. Many of us still have the wrong ideas about holiness and what it means to be a saint. \nBut the truth is that saints are not “extraordinary” people — they are not like “extraterrestrials” who come down to earth. Too many people think like that — and it gets in the way of helping them to see what God wants with our lives. \nSaints are regular people like you and me. What makes the difference is that saints really believe that they are children of God. They really believe that God made them for a reason, for a relationship. \nGod did not just create us — and then leave us alone. That is not who God is. That is not how he works. God is our Father. He wants to help us grow. He loves every one of us like his own daughters, like his own son. \nThat is why God sent Jesus into the world. He is meant to be our older brother. God sent him to show us the way. That is why it is so important for us to have a relationship — a personal relationship — with Jesus. Because only when we know Jesus can we find true happiness, true love. \nIt seems to me that one of the challenges we have today is to really help people believe that we can have a relationship with God. \nSo, in my conversations with young people, I have been challenging them to spend this school year really trying to grow in their relationship with Jesus. \nFor me, growing in that relationship means a kind of two-step daily program. \nFirst, we need to spend just a few minutes a day praying. We need to turn off our phones and just try to be alone and be quiet with God. Just talk to Jesus in your heart. Ask him questions, tell him what you are thinking, what is going on in your life. \nWe do not need to do this for a long time. Just a few minutes is all we need. What is important is to just get into this habit of talking to Jesus. \nFor the second step, I tell our young people they can use their phones! I prefer to read the Gospels in a book, but I suggest that they may want to download a Bible app. \nThe important thing is to make time every day to try to read a passage from the Gospels. Reflect a little on the words of Jesus — and on his example. Think about what he is saying, what he is doing. Think about how he responds to different people and situations. \nI have been telling young people that I have been following a simple program like this since I was their age. And I promise: It works! These habits start to change your life. The more we pray, the more we reflect on the Gospels, the more we begin to see that Jesus is with us, that he is working in our lives and in the world. \nAnd as we keep going in following Jesus, we start to think and act more like Jesus, more like a “saint.” It is a beautiful thing. You realize you are joyful, you are happy. \nClick To Tweet \nPray for me this week and I will be praying for you. And let us pray for our young people. \nMay our Blessed Mother Mary help them — and all of us — to grow in our relationship with Jesus so that we can become saints and make being saints the way for our lives. \nCopyright 2017 Archbishop José H.

      "text": "Tuesday, October 24, 2017 Halloween Movie Madness '17: The Dungeonmaster October is finally here! This year, it brings the long awaited return of Halloween Movie Madness! I decided I needed to try and make this year special, so most of the movies on this year's list are films that I haven't seen before(and I will probably wish I never sat through half of them). The Dungeonmaster/Ragewar (1984) I've watched this movie countless times over the years thanks to a VHS copy I scored from a closing video store. Now, I actually own this movie on DVD! It's part of a four pack from Scream Factory. I've never even heard of the other three movies, but they seem right up my alley. When I put the movie in, I noticed something weird. All my life, I remember the credits starting first thing. On the DVD, however, we get a cold open. I was confused, and was telling my wife that I didn't remember any of what we were seeing. Paul (our hero), was chasing a woman through a bunch of corridors. When he finally catches up to her, she immediately disrobes. Completely naked. I really think I would remember full frontal nudity like that. Once the credits start up, I noticed the title card was Ragewar, and not Dungeonmaster. I fired up the VHS version, and sure enough, that scene was not there. The movie itself tells the story of a computer genius who can use his glasses and a remote connection to his computer X-CALBR8 to do things like change traffic lights so he doesn't have to slow down on his daily run. After his girlfriend Gwen comes over for dinner (and is proposed to, but doesn't give an answer), they go to sleep. Paul has a weird dream, and when he wakes up, she is gone! He goes into the living room, only to be magicked away by Bull from Night Court, also known as Mestema (or the Debil) Mestema sets Paul up against seven challenges, and if he survives, he and Gwen are free to go. If not, the Devil gets their souls. Simple enough concept. Each of these challenges were written and directed by different people, making this an anthology of sorts. Paul has to defeat frozen people, like Jack the Ripper. He has to fight five undead creatures. He has to save Gwen from a serial killer and the band WASP. Seriously. He even defeats them through the power of sound (Mestema gave Paul a wrist mounted version of X-CALBR8. Oh, he also calls Paul by the name Excalibrate.) He has to defeat a giant Harryhausen-esque giant statue. And then there's the Mad Max ripoff with plywood cars. There is also the final showdown with Mestema, but that is probably the most boring part of this thing. I have much love for this movie. I know how terrible it is, and that's why I said on a previous occasion that it would be perfect for RiffTrax . I know this movie isn't great, but I am blinded by my love for it. By",

Female members of the Congressional Black Caucus called on Kelly to apologize to Wilson. \nSanders — questioned about the matter at a forum Monday with White House reporters — says she didn’t think Kelly was wrong “and therefore I don’t think he should offer an apology.”",

      "text": "October 23, 2017 / no comments \nThis week we are crushing on Andrew Shier from Ten Minute Detour . \nHailing from Calgary, Ten Minute detour has been making good old rock and roll since 2013. Andrew and his bandmates have shared the stage with the likes of One Bad Son and Royal Tusk, playing hundreds of shows accross Canada. In 2015 TMD put out their debut album Lay it Down. Now the boys are back with a new record and the same great old sound. \nCommon Pleasure was produced by Lincoln Parish (Cage The Elephant) in Nashville. Together he and the band recorded seven tracks in just seven days. One of those tracks is “Betty”, a song that may have one of the sweetest backstories of all time. “Betty” was inspired by our crush’s grandmother, who is the song’s namesake. Says Andrew, “the song was written about the last time I saw her before she passed. I had hooked up her 8-track player, and put on one of her dad’s cassettes from the 1940’s. Not having heard him in decades, she was moved to tears and couldn’t stop dancing around the kitchen – this was in her mid-90’s. It was a surreal experience seeing how music can ignite the soul, present us with pure emotion and joy.“ \nWatch the video for “Betty” below: \nI don’t know about you guys, but I’m definitely swooning over here. Learn more about Andrew below! What is the first thing that you notice about a potential love interest? \nTheir attitude. I’m pretty quick to judge, but I’d say I’m always right half the time. \n\nWhat is your definition of romance? \nOysters and Chablis. Grungy rock bars and PBR. The Hip and cottage country. I guess it’s pretty circumstantial. \nWhat is your ideal first date? \nUsually going to a show makes for a good first date. Nott too much time to talk, and you can find out if your musical tastes align, that’s important. \nWhat’s your instant deal breaker? \nIf they want to live in the same city for the rest of their lives. Can’t do it. \nWhat is the best piece of romance advice you have ever received? \nMy mom was always very vocal on how women should be treated. Be a gentleman, be respectful, don’t be an asshole. \nIf there was one piece of advice you could give to other men/women out there, what would it be? \nArguing is a waste of time. Life is about compromise and if you can’t do that step away and wait, don’t look for something to come your way. You can spend too much time worrying about stuff you can’t control, rather than taking care of your own needs and desires. \n\nHow do you keep the romance alive in your relationship? \nDon’t take things too seriously, and don’t get too comfortable. Try and be spontaneous to avoid a stale relationship. The only thing stale relationships are good for are stuffing your sorrows.",

PDT October 23, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nRepublican lawmakers say the results of a state Senate investigation into Sound Transit found that the agency misled lawmakers and the public while trying to pass a $54 billion transit package. But Democratic Senators who serve on the Law and Justice Committee that conducted the investigation say they don't agree with the findings released on Monday. \n“Sound Transit played fast and loose with the truth,” Sen. Mike Padden, Republican chair of the Senate Law and Justice Committee, said in a release. “It kept key facts from the Legislature and the voters. It displayed disregard for laws designed to ensure full disclosure and prevent public resources from being used for campaigns.” \nThe probe , led by Republican lawmakers, investigated whether Sound Transit deliberately hid the cost of the tax package known as Sound Transit 3, or ST3. \nRelated: Lawmakers hold second investigatory hearing into Sound Transit, ST3 \nThe ST3 measure approved by voters last November will pay to expand mass transit in King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties. \nThe state Senate Law and Justice Committee found that the agency concealed the true cost of the ST3 measure, by going to the public with a larger tax package than originally pitched to the legislature. In 2015, Sound Transit proposed a tax package that would generate $15 billion over 15 years. However, the ST3 measure called for a much larger package that covered 25 years of new revenue. \nThe investigation also found Sound Transit improperly used public resources to promote a third-party campaign for a ballot measure. \nThe committee asked lawmakers to consider legislation to give taxpayers substantial tax relief and restrict agency campaign activities, such as advertising budget and lobbying. It also advised potential campaign violations be referred to a prosecutor’s office. \nSound Transit called the investigation a “highly partisan endeavor” that “perpetuates fictions” about ST3. \n“The committee’s final report is a sham that the minority members did not even have a chance to review before its release,” Sound Transit spokesperson Geoff Patrick said in a statement. \nRelated: Memo to Sound Transit Board on Senate work sessions \nSens. Jamie Pedersen and David Frockt, both Seattle Democrats who serve on the committee, said they did not know the Republican-led committee would be releasing the investigation findings on Monday. \n\"Absolutely not. And these aren't even the findings of the committee, because for it to be a committee report, we'd have to have had hearings where we had a draft report to consider and an opportunity for minority members to make comments or draft a minority report, and we haven't had any of that process,\" said Pedersen. \"This is purely a political effort by the Senate Republicans.\" \nPedersen said that after sitting through hours of testimony during the Law and Justice Committee's investigation, he does not believe that Sound Transit misled lawmakers or the public. \n\"Frankly, I think there was not a lot of evidence to support the allegations,\" he said. \"I think this investigation was a waste of taxpayer money. \n© 2017 KING-TV",

      "text": "Coyotes Embrace Long Trip, Chance to Bond Arizona begins a five-game journey on Tuesday at the Islanders by Dave Vest @davest4yotes / Coyotes Sr. Director of News Content \nNEW YORK - The Coyotes are starting a challenging five-game road trip on Tuesday still seeking their first win of the season after eight tries. \nMorale at the team's practice on Monday at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., was good because the consensus around the team is that the current won-loss record is not indicative of the team they are or, more importantly, the team they feel they can still become. \nCenter Brad Richardson likened the team's funk to a few he experienced as a member of the Los Angeles Kings in 2011-12. That team endured two five-game losing streaks within the first 30 games of the season and eventually won the Stanley Cup as the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference. \n\"Things can get turned around, you just can't let it go on for too long,\" Richardson said. \"We've had some good games. We were right there and then at the end they score with just a few minutes left. That's happened a few times, but one win could change everything around and get some bounces going our way. Obviously you want to get off to a good start and that didn't happen. We have to try to figure out a way to turn it around and just get one (win) and hopefully that can spur us and turn us the other way.\" \nArizona will begin its trip vs. the New York Islanders, who have earned five out of a possible six points at home. Games vs. the New York Rangers, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Detroit will follow, in that order, every other night, except for the games at Philadelphia and Detroit, which will be played on back-to-back nights next week. The five teams are a combined 10-8-4 at home this season. \n\"Everybody knows road trips are tough, especially when they are so long,\" forward Tobias Rieder said. \"I think it's a good thing. We have time to grow together as a team more and start winning.\" \nForward Jordan Martinook agreed. \n\"Whenever a team gets on the road it feels like you can kind of come together that way,\" Martinook said. \"There's more of a real team-like feel on the road. Hopefully we can continue that good building of a team, and hopefully it will translate into wins.\" \nThe Coyotes flew to New York on Sunday, an off day, and practiced later in the day on Monday in an effort to get the players better acclimated to the time change. Travel for the first three games of the trip, all in the New York City area, will be minimal, and being anchored in the same hotel in Lower Manhattan for five nights is a plus. \n\"It's always fun being in the big city and playing the teams here,\" Rieder said. \"It should be exciting. I don't think there's any distractions here. Everyone is a professional and we know what we're here for, so it's pretty easy to focus on hockey.\" \n\nHead Coach Rick Tocchet, a former player who skated in 1,144 NHL games, is hoping the players will use the time together to speak openly to each other about the 0-7-1 start to the season. \n\"It's big because you're together a lot, whether it's dinners, practices, hotel lobbies,\" Tocchet said. \"...You're with the guys a lot. Some things might come up. You might say to a player, 'Hey man, we need you to do this' or 'You haven't been playing hard enough.' Things come up when you're around a person a lot. So I think that's why people say this bonding stuff, it does work.\"",

More >>  31   This   \nBy MICHAEL BIESECKERAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the   Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips",

Female members of the Congressional Black Caucus called on Kelly to apologize to Wilson. \nSanders — questioned about the matter at a forum Monday with White House reporters — says she didn’t think Kelly was wrong “and therefore I don’t think he should offer an apology.”",

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court... \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Philadelphia's former top prosecutor is scheduled to be sentenced after pleading guilty in a corruption scandal. \nCourt records show that Seth Williams is set to appear in federal court on Tuesday afternoon. He faces up to five years in prison for a single count of accepting a bribe from a businessman. \nThe ex-district attorney was disbarred by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last week. \nThe two-term Democrat pleaded guilty in June, two weeks into a trial that included damaging testimony about a stream of money and gifts showered on him. A federal judge said he \"sold\" his office and ordered him immediately jailed. \nWilliams was Philadelphia's first black district attorney. \nHe spent years as an assistant prosecutor and was previously tasked with rooting out corruption as the city's inspector general.",

      "text": "After Las Vegas shooting, government grants Texas State officer training program over $5M A large grant could help law enforcement with mass shooting situations Michael Perchick, KVUE 11:17   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nIn light of recent mass shooting attacks across the country, the focus on responding to active shooter situations has gained further interest. \nMuch of that interest is focused on ALERRT – Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training – at Texas State in San Marcos. \n“We always have a waiting list,” explained Executive Director Dr. Peter Blair. \nThis week, the federal government granted nearly $5.4 million in new funding to the program – money which will go directly towards training. \n“[We work with] anywhere from very small departments that maybe only have a couple police officers up to NYPD. We've provided training for them,” Blair said. \nAbout 95 percent of their training is done remotely, with the rest taking place at a training center nearby. \nThe program was first established in 2002, but it began to receive widespread attention after the Newtown attacks. \n“Certainly when Sandy Hook Elementary School happened, and all those kids that were killed - that was a major outcry that happened at that point in time. The federal government started to look at what programs they had that they could fund up more to provide more training to law enforcement officers around the country. Fortunately, at that point in time, we had been funded by the Bureau of Justice System for several years at that point, so there was already a federally established program. At that point in time, the FBI vetted our program, sent several of their officers through our training, and decided that they’re going to adopt our program and declare us as the national standard,” said Dr. Blair. \nMuch of their efforts focus on law enforcement integration and making sure all units are working together. \n“When you look at Vegas, that many people who were hurt or injured, it's going to take a lot of careful effort to get those people the help that they need. Any event we see - there's always multiple phases,” said Dr. Blair. \nThe grant money, which was secured in part by efforts led by Rep. John Carter and Sen. John Cornyn, will help them work with more departments across the country. \n“We find with these things that it's not so much an equipment program - we have the basic equipment that we need in most cases to respond to these events, though more is always better. But it's the idea of the human capital, the human people. Teaching them what to do because they need to make the decisions about how to utilize that equipment in order to save lives,” explained Dr. Blair. \nCurrently, their waiting list includes 100 departments. About 95 percent of their teaching is done remotely, though they do have their own training course. \nALERRT also has an active research program that works with Texas State University, where Dr. Blair is a tenured professor. \n© 2017 KVUE-TV",

      "text": "A A \nSouth Park airs on Comedy Central \nLast year, just days after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone told a reporter that the next season of their show wouldn’t take aim at Trump, because “satire has become reality.” After 20 years of skewering public figures from Steve Jobs to Donald Rumsfeld to Britney Spears, Parker and Stone seemed stumped. What happens when you flip off the principal, Stone mused in an interview in May, and he flips you off right back? “The comedian pushes the button,” Parker asserted. “That’s the natural order of things.” \nHe knows button pushing. Since 1997, Parker and Stone (but, let’s be honest, mostly Parker) have riled the world as proudly flippant “equal-opportunity offenders.’ ’ Last season, their 20th, tracked the real-life events of the presidential election (the show produces new installments week by week), casting its two presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton and a Trump-like Mr. Garrison — as a choice between a “Turd Sandwich” and a “Giant Douche.” South Park ’s early seasons, which premiered in the dawn of the internet and long before the existence of social media, worked political material around the cartoon’s main conceit of four potty-mouthed boys (Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, voiced by Parker and Stone) growing up in small-town Colorado. Before algorithms gave TV writers the incentive to rip highly clickable stories from the headlines, and long before Trump triggered a never-ending global crisis that begs constant attention, South Park was largely a show about — and that reflected the sensibility of — white American boyhood. \nThat’s not to say it hasn’t been jubilantly controversial from the get-go. South Park is notorious for reveling in its naughtiness — Isaac Hayes, who voiced the character of Chef, quit in protest of a 2005 episode that lampooned his religion, Scientology. But the series oozed a fatuous resistance to soapbox statements, a pubescent reflex that reduced every vaguely political plot to jokes about shit and dicks. In the first episode to air after 9/11, titled “Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,” the takedown of America’s public enemy No. 1 starts with bin Laden’s pants coming down — and it takes half a dozen magnifying glasses to make out his penis. \nThere were political overtones before 9/11, of course; an episode from 2000, in which the town clashes over its racist flag — it depicts four white people hanging a black man, then it’s redesigned so that the four figures are multi-ethnic, with all five holding hands while, still, the black man hangs — is, per Parker, uncomfortably close to reality today. By the mid-2000s, the show had sharpened its focus on current events. In 2007, Cartman eyed the new Muslim kid in town suspiciously, convinced he’s a terrorist; because this is South Park and not 24 — whose countdown clock the episode parodies — Cartman tortures his new classmate’s parents by farting in their faces. \nIn that episode, which aired a couple of months after Hillary Clinton announced her intention to run in the 2008 presidential race, Cartman worries about a potential terrorist attack at a Hillary rally in South Park . Turns out Cartman is right: Terrorists have hidden a tiny nuclear device … in Hillary Clinton’s “snatch.” When one of her aides suggests they probe inside Senator Clinton — who’s drawn with exaggeratedly large hips — to see if they can defuse the nuke, a bomb expert declares, “I'm not sending any of my men in there.” \nSouth Park ’s laddish libertarian ethos shields it from complaints about insensitivity, of course; as many an alt-right acolyte could tell you, criticism slides off like milk on Teflon when you’re only in it for the lulz. And lest viewers worry that South Park had become too didactic, that episode ended with the revelation that it’s not the Muslim family that’s behind the attack; it’s America’s foundational enemy, the British, who are sailing toward the colonies in old-timey ships, clad in red coats and armed with muskets. It’s a textbook South Park twist, an expression of the show’s perennial anxiety about articulating, or appearing to articulate, a serious political critique. In the end, for better or worse, the show always pivots to fart in your face. \nThe fart in our face this season is the creators’ reluctance, at the halfway point at least, to take on Trump and his supporters. The season premiere, which aired a month after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, seemed poised to parody the specter of white nationalism, a topic the show has not shied away from in the past. But the episode dodges the issue of race almost entirely; angry white men screaming, “They terk er jerbs” march through the town carrying tiki torches and confederate flags, but even when they chant “You will not replace us,” they’re let off the hook — their target is corporate-backed automation. \nThe second episode, in which a panicked Tweek finds himself caught between North Korea’s nuclear arms program and the president’s tweets, is better; South Park has always been good at evoking the immediate aftermath of national tragedy, the slack-jawed, stunned stupor of people who have just realized something terrible has happened. In “Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,” Kyle’s mom is comatose on the couch, where she’s been watching CNN for eight weeks straight; in 2016, Parker and Stone rewrote in a single day the post-election episode they’d been working on; it opened with a familiar scene: an election-night party steeped in sorrow and disbelief. \nThe relative absence of Trump is disappointing for a show that loves to shit on power — and especially questionable considering South Park has never had a problem shitting on Hillary Clinton, a woman who has never been in as comparably powerful a position as Trump’s. The nuke bit wasn’t the first time Hillary appeared on the show: In a 2002 episode, a newscaster shows a picture of her and announces, “Her ass just keeps getting bigger and bigger.” She makes a brief cameo in 2009’s “Eat, Pray, Queef,” in which the men and boys of South Park record a charity single advocating a woman’s right to queef. \nAnd there she was in the episode that aired the day after the 2016 presidential election, “Oh, Jeez,” in which she schemes to stop the show’s Trump surrogate, Giant Douche, from taking office. “Oh, Jeez” also features a wizened Bill Clinton, who declares, “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch.” Even on Nov. 9, 2016, South Park was harsher on Hillary Clinton than it was on Donald Trump. (Trump, incidentally, has appeared as himself only once, in 2001, as one of several celebrity investors brought in to view a machine invented by Mr. Garrison.)

      "text": "Baker, O’Donnell undeserving of Gold Star attention By tweet Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker speaks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing to discuses ways to stabilize health insurance markets​, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) \nGov. Charlie Baker loves words that start with the letter “d”, and not just the one that he should have already embraced, which is “Democrat.” \nIn case you missed it, the Republican In Name Only (RINO) governor took yet another swipe at Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he found the president’s telephone conversation with a Florida Gold Star widow “incredibly disgraceful and discouraging and depressing.” \nNaturally, Tall Deval has no idea what was actually said in the conversation, or the context, but he’s… distressed, you might say. It used to be that Baker was merely “disappointed” in the president, but as the 2018 election nears, he’s upped the decibel level, to dust off another “d” word. \nA year ago, before the presidential election, he smugly announced that he would be blanking the top line on the ballot. This, Faker Baker declared to various reporters, was either “hugely disappointing” or “extremely disappointing.” \nSince the inauguration, the House’s vote to repeal Obamacare has “disappointed” him, while Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord left the governor “very disappointed.” \nTo be fair, for Tall Deval, disappointment comes from every political direction. Obama’s decision last year on the offshore “national-monuments” designation “deeply disappointed” him. At the State House, he has found both declining state tax revenues and hack state-college presidents walking away with $335,000 cash payouts to be “disappointing.” A decision to let corrupt pols keep their ill-gotten state pensions left Tall Deval “extremely disappointed.” \nIn June I wrote about Charlie’s string of disappointing disappointments, and he subsequently dialed back his use of his favorite “d” word, although the president’s statements about Charlottesville in August “deeply disappointed” the depressed demi-Democrat. \nBut I think this latest denunciation of the president is a harbinger of things to come in Tall Deval’s upcoming campaign. And may I suggest another “d” word for the Baker reelection effort – “disgust.” It’s already in his dictionary for dummies—a year ago he found the president “not only inappropriate but outrageous and disgusting.” \nRemember that word, disgusting. You read it here first. \nTall Deval, of course, went to Harvard, and you know that ancient axiom: “You can always tell a Harvard man, but you can’t tell him much.” \nHarvard’s motto used to start with a “V” – Veritas – and it still does, only now the phrase is “Virtue Signaling.” \nCharlie’s not the only Harvard man in public life living up to the V phrase. How about Lawrence O’Donnell, ’74, five years ahead of Tall Deval? \nIn case you missed it, and I’m guessing you did, the tough street kid from St. Seb’s went off on a rant this week on MSNBC, and this time he wasn’t slurring Mormons or screaming, “Stop the hammering!” at a blue-collar studio work crew. \nThis time O’Donnell was trying to class-shame Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, for his defense of the president. Sounding like a busing-era bow-tied swell from Brookline or Lincoln, O’Donnell sniffed that he “knows” Oak Square, Brighton, which Kelly came out of, because he comes from an “identical” neighborhood. \nReally? Kelly’s father was a mailman, O’Donnell’s a lawyer. In the early 70’s, as O’Donnell was adjusting his cravat, sipping brandies Alexander and tossing off precious bon mots in the Harvard Lampoon, Kelly was serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. Yeah, they have identical backgrounds all right. \nO’Donnell also said that Kelly went to “segregated schools.” The future general graduated the now-closed St. Mary’s High School in Waltham – if O’Donnell is accusing the Christian Brothers of being racists, that’s an even more scurrilous attack than he made against the Mormons a few years back. \nAnd for that matter, how many blacks were in the St. Sebastian’s Class of ’70? \nBy the way, I’m sure that when Trump was going after the Gold Star father Khizr Khan last year, O’Donnell was slamming the future president as the worst person in the world. But now O’Donnell casually dismisses a different Gold Star father as a racist, even though he knows absolutely nothing about Kelly, let alone what’s in his heart. \nBut lifelong pampered puke O’Donnell isn’t engaging in hate speech, he’s speaking truth to power. Just ask him. The PC hypocrisy here – not to mention the classism – is so thick you could cut it with a knife. \nI’ll bet Lawrence O’Donnell loves Charlie Baker. They have so much in common. Dim dismal Democrat demagogues.

The behind-the-scenes research and high-level meetings convened by Dr. Steven Greer will expose the degree of illegal, covert operations at the core of UFO secrecy. From briefings with the CIA Director, top Pentagon Generals and Admirals, to the briefing of President Obama via senior advisor John Podesta, chairman of the Hillary Clinton Campaign, we take the viewer behind the veil of secrecy and into the corridors of real power where the UFO secrets reside.

      "text": "Top US general reveals new info on Niger ambush Posted: Updated: \nBy Zachary Cohen CNN \nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- The US troops attacked in Niger were on their way back to their operating base when they were ambushed by 50 ISIS fighters, according to Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, who provided a timeline of the attack on Monday. \nFour US and five Nigerien soldiers were killed and two Americans were wounded in the attack that occurred on October 4, but details of what happened remain murky more than two weeks after the incident as investigators work to determine precisely what happened, a US official has told CNN. \nDuring the Pentagon briefing Monday, Dunford clarified that the US troops requested additional support about an hour after the firefight began. \nRemotely piloted aircraft arrived overhead within minutes of the request for help. French Mirage jets arrived on the scene approximately one hour later -- two hours after the troops made initial contact with enemy forces. \n\"It's important to note when they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgment would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support,\" Dunford said. \"And so well we'll find out in the investigation exactly why it took an hour for them to call.\" \nDunford said there is no indication that the US troops were operating outside their orders at the time of the ambush. \n\"I don't have any indication right now to believe or to know that they did anything other than operate within the orders that they were given,\" Dunford said. \"That's what the investigation's all about. So I think anyone that speculates about what special operations forces did or didn't do is doing exactly that, they're speculating.\" \nStill, Dunford said the military will be investigating if the planned reconnaissance mission changed. \n\"It was planned as a reconnaissance mission. What happened after they began to execute, in other words, did the mission change? That is one of the questions that's being asked. It's a fair question but I can't tell you definitively the answer to that question. But, yes, we've seen the reports, we've seen the speculation,\" he said. \nOne US soldier, Sgt. La David Johnson, was separated from his 12-member team as it was ambushed by 50 ISIS fighters, and his body was recovered 48 hours later nearly a mile away from the central scene of the ambush in Niger, four administration officials familiar with the early assessment of what happened had told CNN on Friday. \nDunford said Monday that he could not definitely confirm reports that Johnson was found nearly a mile away but that those details would come to light as part of the investigation. \n\"I think we owe the families and American people transparency,\" Dunford said. \nUnanswered questions \nThat commitment to providing more information to the families of fallen soldiers -- and the American people -- comes as lawmakers continue to raise questions over exactly what transpired in Niger and the extent of US military involvement in Africa. \nSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain has criticized the Pentagon and Trump administration for not being forthcoming about the attack -- threatening a subpoena last week -- and Defense Secretary James Mattis went to Capitol Hill on Friday to meet with both McCain and South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. \n\"One of the fights I'm having with the administration is the armed services committee is not getting enough information,\" McCain said Monday on ABC's \"The View.\"\"We deserve it.\" \nIn the aftermath of the ambush, several key lawmakers have said they didn't know the US had troops in Niger. \n\"I didn't know there was 1,000 troops in Niger,\" Graham said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday. \nBut the Pentagon and White House have previously notified Congress about the US mission in Niger several times this year. \nThe Pentagon is still looking at the exact circumstances of how and when Johnson became separated, but is emphasizing that the search for Johnson began immediately and dozens of US forces were quickly moved to Niger's capital Niamey to be ready to go into the field, which some did. \nJoint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie told reporters last week that US, French and Nigerien forces \"never left the battlefield\" until Johnson was found. \nExperts working for US Africa Command are trying to establish an hour-by-hour timeline of what happened as part of a comprehensive investigation that includes all the military branches and elements of US intelligence agencies that were involved in the mission. \nCNN previously reported that the French Mirage jets that arrived overhead within 30 minutes of the firefight to fly low passes in an attempt to disperse the attackers did not have permission to drop bombs. \nBut on Friday, US officials said that French jets did have authority to bomb but did not because pilots could not readily identify enemy forces in this firefight and did not want to risk hitting US and Nigerien troops. \nChange in tone? \nMonday's Pentagon briefing with Dunford offers a particularly striking change of tone from the public response of the Trump administration in the wake of the Niger attack. \nPresident Donald Trump's response to the attack has drawn some criticism, particularly his public feud with a Democratic congresswoman over a condolence call he made to Johnson's widow. \nOn Monday, Trump tweeted shortly after Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, discussed her disappointment with the call on \"Good Morning America\" Monday morning, saying the President stumbled on her husband's name and suggesting the only reason he knew it was because the report was right in front of him. \n\"I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!\" Trump tweeted. \nJohnson said she was distraught over Trump's alleged oversights during the call, which came as the Johnson family and Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, who is a friend of the family, rode in a limo to receive Johnson's body from Dover Air Force Base. \n\"(The call) made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice,\" she said. \nA White House official described Monday's briefing as an intentional effort to move beyond the heated rhetoric from all sides on this -- including from the West Wing. \nAn official said White House chief of staff John Kelly and people throughout the West Wing would be watching the briefing. \nKelly became embroiled in the controversy after taking to the White House podium last week to say that he was \"stunned\" by Wilson's decision to take to the press to criticize Trump for his call with a Gold Star widow, though he did not dispute Wilson's claim that Trump told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that he \"knew what he signed up for.\" \nKelly also claimed that Wilson took credit for securing \"$20 million\" in federal funding to build a new FBI field office in Miami in 2015, a claim that was proven erroneous by a video of the dedication ceremony posted Friday by the Sun Sentinel. \nAccusing her of being an \"empty barrel,\" Kelly said Wilson focused more on her own actions than the heroism of the two FBI agents for whom the new building had been named. \nKelly and Dunford maintain a close personal relationship and Kelly described Dunford as his best friend during the White House briefing last week. \nCNN's Jeff Zeleny, Barbara Starr and Ryan Brown contributed reporting \nTM &© 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Study: Climate change costs taxpayers billions By MICHAEL BIESECKER Associated Press 11:13 pm \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips Related Links",

      "text": "Trump shoots down cuts to retirement limit By MARCY GORDON Associated Press 11:15 pm Caption Donald Trump \nWASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump shot down a possible approach for raising revenue to finance tax cuts in politically must-do legislation for the Republicans, promising Monday the popular 401(k) retirement program will be untouched. \nStill, the head of the House’s tax-writing committee indicated that changes to the 401(k) structure may still be on the table as Republicans push an ambitious timetable to get tax legislation written. Asked about the issue, Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Kevin Brady said: “I don’t want to get ahead of the committee. That will all be part of the tax reform bill.” \nAnd in response to whether Trump’s tweet changes in any way what the panel was planning to do, Brady replied only, “no.” \nRepublicans are scrambling to find new revenue sources to pay for anticipated tax cuts exceeding $1 trillion. A proposal to eliminate the widely used federal deduction for state and local taxes has run into heavy opposition from GOP House members from high-tax states, threatening the enactment of tax legislation that Republicans deem essential to retaining their majority in next year’s elections. \nTrump pledged in a tweet there will be “no change” to tax incentives for the 401(k) retirement programs. \nThe plan crafted by Trump and Republican leaders calls for steep tax cuts for corporations and potentially individuals, a doubling of the standard deduction used by most Americans, shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, and the repeal of inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. The child tax credit would be increased and the tax system would be simplified; most Americans would be able to file their income taxes on a postcard, according to the plan. \nCrucial details of the plan have yet to be worked out, notably what income levels would fit with each tax bracket. \nWith the possibility of the state and local deduction being at least partly preserved, some Republican lawmakers were considering limiting the amount workers could save in 401(k) retirement accounts. \n“It was a trial balloon and it crashed,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. “They’re struggling to find legitimate offsets” for tax cuts. \n“Everyone has been promised they are going to be better off with tax reform and that’s really hard to do in a fiscally responsible way,” Riedl said. \nEmployees’ earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren’t taxed until retirement; pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-preferred status. That cost the government $82.7 billion in lost revenue in the recent budget year ending Sept. 30, 2016 – a potentially juicy target for Republican tax-cutters. \nWith 55 million U.S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class. \n“This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!” Trump tweeted. “There will be NO change to your 401(k).” \nAppearing with Ivanka Trump in Pennsylvania, U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza echoed the president, telling the audience the retirement plans “will not be touched.” \nRep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the Trump-rejected proposal on retirement plans: “There are still some dials that do have to be turned. This is a major effort and when you dial one thing you have to look at another.” \nHouse Republicans will be working to pass a budget this week so they can turn their attention to the tax overhaul. Trump warned Sunday that action on tax reform is crucial to avoiding political failure in 2018. He’ll work to rally support for the plan at the Capitol today. \nTrump personally implored House GOP members on a conference call to swiftly adopt the budget that was passed last week by the Senate, with the hope of clearing the way for what he described as historic tax cuts. \nTrump told the lawmakers they were on the verge of doing something historic, according to one Republican official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what was intended as a private update for members. \nAnother GOP aide familiar with the conversation said Trump told the members again and again that the party would pay a steep price in next year’s midterm elections if it failed to pass his plan. \nThe Senate last week passed a budget plan that includes rules that will allow Republicans to get tax legislation through the Senate without Democratic votes or fear of a Democratic filibuster. House Republicans signaled Friday they would simply accept the Senate plan to avoid any potential delay on the tax measure. \nRepublicans are desperate to rack up a legislative win after a series of embarrassing failures despite the party controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. Topping the list: their stalled attempts to pass legislation repealing and replacing “Obamacare.” If tax overhaul legislation doesn’t pass, many in the party fear a complete rout in 2018. \n___ \nAP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and AP writers Jill Colvin, Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.

      "text": "Trump is attending the weekly Senate Republican lunch Tuesday in an attempt to gather support for a tax reform bill that has yet to be released. He’ll be in a closed-door lunch where many in the room are those he’s publicly attacked, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump has also feuded with, called the visit “a photo op.”\n“Tomorrow’s a photo op, nothing more nothing less. To read anything more into it would be spending a lot of time on something that shouldn’t be spent a lot of time on,” Corker said. “It’s going to be up and down for the next three years and that’s just the way it’s going to be. I don’t read anything into tomorrow other than a photo op.”\nSome Republicans on the Hill are skeptical of Trump’s party loyalty after instances where he openly attacked elected Republicans and members of the party's congressional leadership. His former top adviser, Steve Bannon, has declared an all-out “war” with the GOP establishment, vowing to run a primary candidate against nearly every sitting Senate Republican up for re-election in 2018.\nRepublicans are entering into a critical phase in their effort to pass tax reform. Some conservative members are going out on a limb, breaking their campaign promise and their principled stance of opposing any legislation that would add to the deficit in order to advance tax reform.\n“Am I feeling the pressure to get this done? Yes. Have I been willing to negotiate a little more generously because of that pressure? Yeah. That’s just shooting straight with you,” said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\nThe Senate passed their budget last week, a critical step in moving forward on tax legislation. The House is taking up the Senate’s budget this week, even though it adds to the deficit.\nHouse Republicans plan to move quickly on tax reform. They expect to unveil legislation within the next two weeks with a goal of passing it before Thanksgiving. But the Senate is likely to move more slowly, hoping to pass their bill before Christmas.\nTrump told House Republicans that the Senate needs to move more quickly because the longer they wait the more time people have to change their minds.\nWhile Trump urges party unity, he and his team have yet to reach out to two critical members of the Senate on the issue. Both Sens. McCain and Susan Collins, R-Maine, say that they have yet to speak with Trump or White House aides about tax reform.\nPlay\nFacebook Twitter Embed Bannon Explains Trump's America First Approach as 'Jacksonian' 2:51 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog “I had early on (had a meeting) with members of the president’s economic council but mainly I’ve been talking about my colleagues about it,” Collins said.\nWhile Trump impressed his Republican credentials in the call to House Republicans, he also knocked McCain, without naming him, for not voting for health care. And he told them that he’ll work to get the support of four Democrats from states that he won by 20 or 30 points.\nWhite House aides and the president have been heavily courting Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, all Democrats who are from states that Trump won and are up for reelection in 2018.\nAll three joined Trump at rallies in their respective states in recent months and attended meetings at the White House. Heitkamp and Manchin attended a bipartisan dinner at Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s house with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n“You keep asking us if we’re going to support it. I don’t know what ‘it’ is,” Heitkamp said of the unreleased bill.\nTrump warned Republicans that the 2018 elections will be a “bloodbath” if they don’t pass tax reform.",

      "text": "RICHBORO, Pa. -- At the end of Monday's town hall meeting on her father's tax reform plan at a senior center in Richboro, Ivanka Trump flashed a grin at the audience. \"Is there anything more invigorating,\" she asked, \"than getting out of Washington?\"\nIt was the most Trumpian thing she'd said all day, after a session spent soberly discussing the merits -- but not too many of the details -- of the Republican plan to overhaul the tax code.\nIvanka Trump, a senior White House adviser as well as presidential progeny, characterized the plan as an improvement for working-class families -- in particular a proposed expansion of the child tax credit, which she advocated on the campaign trail.\nTrump said she was pushing to have that tax credit made refundable -- which analysts have said could go a long way toward helping low- and middle-income families defray the costs of raising a child. But the administration has not outlined some key elements of that plan, including how much it plans to expand the credit. On Monday, Ivanka Trump didn't get that far, either.\nWith moderator Nan Hayworth, a former House member from New York, and U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza, Trump spent about an hour conversing with a crowd of around 200 at the James Kinney Senior Center. The women on stage talked about fiscal issues facing ordinary Americans: how complicated it can be to file taxes, how many Americans don't have more than a few hundred dollars saved in case of an emergency, and how important it is to prepare students for jobs in a technology-driven economy.\nBut, Trump said, the administration is also banking on cutting the corporate tax rate, which it believes will spur growth and trickle down to workers. The administration wants to keep new businesses in the country, she said. \"Younger entrepreneurs, as they're assessing the global dynamics around where they should start and headquarter their businesses, it's not this city vs. that city,\" Trump said. \"It's this country vs. that country, and as a young person is starting their entrepreneurial endeavor, there's a lot more latitude to pick up and move.\"\nCarranza nodded, then noted how many recent college graduates have defaulted on their student loans.\n\"A rising tide,\" Trump said, \"lifts all boats.\"\nShe said the administration's focus on deregulation works in tandem with its tax plan, designed to boost the economy by rescinding industry regulations that people were \"losing sleep over.\"\nLegislatively, though, her father's administration was \"laser-focused\" on tax reform, she said. No tax bill has yet been written, and the provisions under discussion are subject to change. For instance, on Monday, President Donald Trump promised on Twitter to leave 401(k) plans alone. Republican lawmakers had been considering placing limits on the popular retirement benefit's tax breaks as a way of helping to pay for tax cuts.\n After a week in which her father had pumped his tax plan in between sparring with critics over his handling of a bereavement call to a Gold Star widow and tweeting about football players kneeling during the national anthem, the furthest Ivanka Trump strayed from taxes was a series of comments about the importance of women in science and technology fields, telling a pair of seventh-graders in the audience that it was an issue she was particularly passionate about.\nShe left a question about whether the tax plan could actually get passed in an increasingly divided Congress -- met with knowing laughter from the audience -- to Carranza: \"We're here to make sure it does get passed,\" the treasurer said, to applause.\nBucks County is represented by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a first-term Republican who has at times defied GOP leaders, including on President Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The president narrowly won Fitzpatrick's 8th District, 48.2 percent to 48 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to calculations by the political website Daily Kos.\nA small group of protesters waved signs outside the senior center before Ivanka Trump's arrival; Lois Pflueger, 67, who voted for President Trump in the primaries but switched to the Democratic Party last year, said she had heard about the event on Facebook and made a sign for her first protest. She was worried about a number of the administration's policies, but is \"infuriated\" about the tax plan's proposal to cut the estate tax, which didn't get a mention at the town hall. High-income estates \"are the ones that should have to be paying,\" she said.\nInside, attendees said they had enjoyed the event and the chance to get close to Ivanka Trump: \"She's always poised and perfect,\" said Joan Cullen, a school board member from the Pennridge School District. She said she was particularly struck by the need to simplify the tax code: \"It needs to be something we can all navigate,\" she said. As for the rest of the news that's surrounded Ivanka's father this week? \"Trump is Trump,\" she said. \"We have to start looking at separating his missteps on a personal level from the work he's doing.\"\n(c)2017 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

Nance , Desertion , life in prison , Military , Politics , President Donald Trump , Sentencing , Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \nFORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) — President Donald Trump’s criticism of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has become a factor in the soldier’s sentencing as a military judge weighs the president’s impact on public perception of military justice. \nThe judge deciding Bergdahl’s punishment for walking off his post in Afghanistan in 2009 heard defense arguments Monday that Trump recently reaffirmed his scathing criticism and is preventing a fair sentencing hearing. Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. \nThe judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, allowed the attorneys to question him about whether he was swayed by Trump’s comments, and responded that he would be fair. \n“I don’t have any doubt whatsoever that I can be fair and impartial in the sentencing in this matter,” Nance said. \nBut he had stern words for prosecutors about what effect Trump’s comments would have on public perception of the case. He indicated he would issue a ruling later on the defense request to dismiss the case because of Trump. \nWhile campaigning, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a “traitor” who deserved harsh punishment such as being shot. Nance previously ruled those comments were “disturbing” but didn’t amount to unlawful command influence and noted the statements were made before Trump became commander in chief. \nBut last week Trump addressed his past comments when asked about them at a news conference. He replied that he couldn’t say anything more about the case, “but I think people have heard my comments in the past.” That, the defense said, shows he harbors the same views now that he commands the military. \nProsecutors argued Trump’s comments didn’t reaffirm his campaign-trail criticism and were narrowly focused on answering a reporter. But Nance said he was having a “hard time” with prosecutors’ interpretation, noting public confidence in military courts was something he had to consider. \nNance said his interpretation was that Trump was essentially saying: “I shouldn’t comment on that, but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.” \nFormer Army lawyer Eric Carpenter said the judge has to worry not only about whether Trump has directly influenced the case, but also what the public thinks under a military justice concept called apparent unlawful command influence. Nance’s remarks Monday should resolve the question of whether Trump directly swayed the court, but the judge could still make concessions to the defense to address these concerns, Carpenter said. \n“It gives you a clue that he’s concerned about public appearance, and he can grant pretty significant remedies just to preserve the public’s faith in the system,” said Carpenter, who teaches law at Florida International University. \nCarpenter doubts the judge would dismiss the case outright, but said Nance could limit Bergdahl’s punishment because of Trump. \nThe White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be “resolved on its own facts.” White House representatives didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Monday. \nBergahl’s sentencing, set to begin Monday, has been delayed until Wednesday because one of the defense attorneys wasn’t available until then, the judge said. \nBergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected. \nNance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl’s willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him. \nBergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Barack Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.——– \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be \"resolved on its own facts.\" White House representatives didn't respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Bergahl's sentencing, set to begin Monday, has been delayed until Wednesday because one of the defense attorneys wasn't available until then, the judge said. Bergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected. Nance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl's willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him. Bergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured soon after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Barack Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. ____",

More >> Police are escorting children to school and a city bus has changed its usual route as a neighborhood near downtown Tampa fears a serial killer may be on the loose. More >> This   More >> \nMOSCOW (AP) - A 35-year-old Russian celebrity TV host who wants to become a presidential candidate opened her first news conference on Tuesday by demanding the release of all political prisoners. \nKsenia Sobchak announced her presidential bid last week, arguing that Russia has grown tired of its current political elite. Critics said Sobchak's run would further fragment the opposition while lending the March election a veneer of legitimacy. \nSobchak is the daughter of President Vladimir Putin's mentor, former St. Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak. Her mother is a lawmaker at the Federation Council, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. She first became known as a fashionable socialite before launching a successful TV career. \nSobchak has joined anti-Kremlin protests and has been often critical of the government, but she has largely avoided criticizing Putin. \nPutin hasn't yet said whether he will seek re-election but he's widely expected to run. \nSpeaking in a packed room, Sobchak told reporters that at least 30 percent of Russians remain without representation and voting for her should change that. \nSobchak has named Igor Malashenko, one of the pioneers of the post-Soviet television and the man behind the 1996 re-election of President Boris Yeltsin, as her campaign chief. Sobchak would not say how much she expects the campaign to cost, saying only that she planned to receive funding help from anonymous businessmen.",

More >>  31   This   \nBy MICHAEL BIESECKERAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the   Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips",

      "text": "President Trump jumped ahead of Republicans' long-planned tax reform maneuvering Monday with a morning tweet that ruled out a proposal under consideration to change the tax treatment of retirement savings.\nAt the moment, Republicans on the House and Senate committees responsible for taxes are supposed to be working out the tax reform details, after their leadership negotiated for months with the Trump administration over a broad framework. The White House has promised that it will be flexible regarding those details.\n\"Things that aren't agreed to in advance, they go into committee, and that's the process that starts\" this week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday on CBS.\nYet Trump dismissed the possibility of a major provision that Republicans might have used to raise revenues for the tax rate reductions he has called for.\nThe specific measure in question is regarded by some experts as a budgetary gimmick, rather than a serious policy change.\nRepublicans were considering lowering the limits on pre-tax contributions to 401(k)s, which are funds that are taxed when they are withdrawn in retirement. Instead, savers would be directed toward Roth IRA-style savings vehicles, in which funds are contributed on an after-tax basis, but then can be withdrawn tax-free upon retirement. Such a switch would make it appear that the government was raising more money in the 10-year timeframe Congress uses to assess the cost of legislation, even though over a long period time it might not make a difference.\nTrump's tweet aimed at cutting off the debate came just days after several reports that the switch was under serious consideration.\nThere will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017 \nJill Hoffman, a tax lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group, suggested that Trump's tweet was driven simply by a \"pretty organic response\" to the negative reaction to those reports.\n\"It sends a strong signal that anything that they do in the context of tax reform that could cut or change retirement savings ... is going to be problematic politically,\" said Hoffman, whose group represents financial firms that manage tax-privileged accounts.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer took advantage of the surprise comment from Trump to criticize the GOP tax reform effort. \"[T]he fact that Republicans were even considering raiding America's retirement savings to pay for a giant tax cut for corporations, states, shows just how backward their plan is,\" the New Yorker said in a statement.\nSchumer's Republican counterparts were more reserved about the impact of Trump's tweet.\n\"At least for right now, it's in everybody's best interest to keep their gunpowder dry and talk about kind of the high-level stuff and then let the committees get in and start working the details,\" said South Dakota's John Thune, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.\nThune noted that to assess the effect of ending any particular tax break, it's necessary to also see the corresponding benefits, such as lower rates, and assess the plan as a whole.\nNevertheless, he acknowledged, \"If that's something that's a non-negotiable for him, that'll probably shape the thinking of people up here.\"\nIn the early going, congressional Republicans have encountered predictable concerns from within their party about plans to eliminate popular breaks. Blue-state Republicans in the House, for instance, have raised the possibility of voting against a plan that cuts the state and local tax deduction, which disproportionately benefits their constituents.\nSome of the party's fiscal hawks are concerned that too many such revenue-raisers — or to regular people, the elimination of a tax break — might prove too politically difficult.\n\"I just don't hear anybody talking about that,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., talking about the need to raise trillions of dollars in eliminated tax breaks to pay for the tax reform package. \"I hear about tax cuts. But it doesn't work without the base-broadeners.\"\nNevertheless, at least one lawmaker stated that the plans for the tax package wouldn't be determined by Trump's Twitter intervention.\nRep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, declined to say whether he planned to lower maximum contributions to 401(k)s in the legislative text. But, asked by a reporter whether Trump's tweet would change what the committee will do, Brady simply responded, \"No.\"",

(AP) - \nThe military judge deciding Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's punishment says comments by President Donald Trump haven't swayed him but he's worried about public perception of the military justice system. Sentencing for Bergdahl on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy was set to begin Monday, but the judge instead heard arguments about a last-minute Trump-related motion. The sentencing case is scheduled to resume on Wednesday. The defense filed a last-minute motion saying that comments Trump made after Bergdahl pleaded guilty show that he can't get a fair sentence with the Republican as commander in chief. Trump harshly criticized Bergdahl on the campaign trail, and recently told reporters that he thinks the public is aware of what he said. Prosecutors argue the most recent comments didn't reaffirm what he said before. But the judge, Army Col. Jeffery Nance, said members of the public could have concerns about fairness in light of Trump's comments. \nPrevious story: Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl will appear before a military judge Monday to learn his punishment for endangering comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan.Bergdahl could get life in prison after pleading guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence.The judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl's willingness to admit guilt, his five years as an enemy captive and serious wounds to the service members who searched for him in 2009.Prosecutors are expected to put on evidence or testimony about soldiers and a Navy SEAL who were seriously wounded by gunfire during separate search missions.

Female members of the Congressional Black Caucus called on Kelly to apologize to Wilson. \nSanders — questioned about the matter at a forum Monday with White House reporters — says she didn’t think Kelly was wrong “and therefore I don’t think he should offer an apology.”",

His response: \"Of course there is!\" pic.twitter.com/PWjpVU0xyp — The View (@TheView) October 23, 2017 \nMcCain also mentioned the \"skinny repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act was \"crazy\" and even asked those in the audience to raise their hands if they knew what a skinny repeal was. \nThe Arizona senior senator voted \"no\" on both the GOP's \"skinny repeal\" in July and, more recently, on the bill sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.). President Donald Trump has expressed his frustrations with McCain for his \"no\" votes. \nWhen McCain voted \"no\" on the Graham-Cassidy bill last month, he said he did so because it was presented on a party-line basis. \n\"As I have repeatedly stressed, health care reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate,\" he said in a statement. \"Committees of jurisdiction should mark up legislation with input from all committee members, and send their bill to the floor for debate and amendment.\" \nREAD: Full statement from Sen. John McCain on voting no on Graham-Cassidy \nMcCain was a guest on the daytime talk show Monday to celebrate his daughter, and now \"The View\" co-host, Meghan's birthday.

      "text": "A A \nSouth Park airs on Comedy Central \nLast year, just days after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone told a reporter that the next season of their show wouldn’t take aim at Trump, because “satire has become reality.” After 20 years of skewering public figures from Steve Jobs to Donald Rumsfeld to Britney Spears, Parker and Stone seemed stumped. What happens when you flip off the principal, Stone mused in an interview in May, and he flips you off right back? “The comedian pushes the button,” Parker asserted. “That’s the natural order of things.” \nHe knows button pushing. Since 1997, Parker and Stone (but, let’s be honest, mostly Parker) have riled the world as proudly flippant “equal-opportunity offenders.’ ’ Last season, their 20th, tracked the real-life events of the presidential election (the show produces new installments week by week), casting its two presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton and a Trump-like Mr. Garrison — as a choice between a “Turd Sandwich” and a “Giant Douche.” South Park ’s early seasons, which premiered in the dawn of the internet and long before the existence of social media, worked political material around the cartoon’s main conceit of four potty-mouthed boys (Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, voiced by Parker and Stone) growing up in small-town Colorado. Before algorithms gave TV writers the incentive to rip highly clickable stories from the headlines, and long before Trump triggered a never-ending global crisis that begs constant attention, South Park was largely a show about — and that reflected the sensibility of — white American boyhood. \nThat’s not to say it hasn’t been jubilantly controversial from the get-go. South Park is notorious for reveling in its naughtiness — Isaac Hayes, who voiced the character of Chef, quit in protest of a 2005 episode that lampooned his religion, Scientology. But the series oozed a fatuous resistance to soapbox statements, a pubescent reflex that reduced every vaguely political plot to jokes about shit and dicks. In the first episode to air after 9/11, titled “Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,” the takedown of America’s public enemy No. 1 starts with bin Laden’s pants coming down — and it takes half a dozen magnifying glasses to make out his penis. \nThere were political overtones before 9/11, of course; an episode from 2000, in which the town clashes over its racist flag — it depicts four white people hanging a black man, then it’s redesigned so that the four figures are multi-ethnic, with all five holding hands while, still, the black man hangs — is, per Parker, uncomfortably close to reality today. By the mid-2000s, the show had sharpened its focus on current events. In 2007, Cartman eyed the new Muslim kid in town suspiciously, convinced he’s a terrorist; because this is South Park and not 24 — whose countdown clock the episode parodies — Cartman tortures his new classmate’s parents by farting in their faces. \nIn that episode, which aired a couple of months after Hillary Clinton announced her intention to run in the 2008 presidential race, Cartman worries about a potential terrorist attack at a Hillary rally in South Park . Turns out Cartman is right: Terrorists have hidden a tiny nuclear device … in Hillary Clinton’s “snatch.” When one of her aides suggests they probe inside Senator Clinton — who’s drawn with exaggeratedly large hips — to see if they can defuse the nuke, a bomb expert declares, “I'm not sending any of my men in there.” \nSouth Park ’s laddish libertarian ethos shields it from complaints about insensitivity, of course; as many an alt-right acolyte could tell you, criticism slides off like milk on Teflon when you’re only in it for the lulz. And lest viewers worry that South Park had become too didactic, that episode ended with the revelation that it’s not the Muslim family that’s behind the attack; it’s America’s foundational enemy, the British, who are sailing toward the colonies in old-timey ships, clad in red coats and armed with muskets. It’s a textbook South Park twist, an expression of the show’s perennial anxiety about articulating, or appearing to articulate, a serious political critique. In the end, for better or worse, the show always pivots to fart in your face. \nThe fart in our face this season is the creators’ reluctance, at the halfway point at least, to take on Trump and his supporters. The season premiere, which aired a month after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, seemed poised to parody the specter of white nationalism, a topic the show has not shied away from in the past. But the episode dodges the issue of race almost entirely; angry white men screaming, “They terk er jerbs” march through the town carrying tiki torches and confederate flags, but even when they chant “You will not replace us,” they’re let off the hook — their target is corporate-backed automation. \nThe second episode, in which a panicked Tweek finds himself caught between North Korea’s nuclear arms program and the president’s tweets, is better; South Park has always been good at evoking the immediate aftermath of national tragedy, the slack-jawed, stunned stupor of people who have just realized something terrible has happened. In “Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,” Kyle’s mom is comatose on the couch, where she’s been watching CNN for eight weeks straight; in 2016, Parker and Stone rewrote in a single day the post-election episode they’d been working on; it opened with a familiar scene: an election-night party steeped in sorrow and disbelief. \nThe relative absence of Trump is disappointing for a show that loves to shit on power — and especially questionable considering South Park has never had a problem shitting on Hillary Clinton, a woman who has never been in as comparably powerful a position as Trump’s. The nuke bit wasn’t the first time Hillary appeared on the show: In a 2002 episode, a newscaster shows a picture of her and announces, “Her ass just keeps getting bigger and bigger.” She makes a brief cameo in 2009’s “Eat, Pray, Queef,” in which the men and boys of South Park record a charity single advocating a woman’s right to queef. \nAnd there she was in the episode that aired the day after the 2016 presidential election, “Oh, Jeez,” in which she schemes to stop the show’s Trump surrogate, Giant Douche, from taking office. “Oh, Jeez” also features a wizened Bill Clinton, who declares, “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch.” Even on Nov. 9, 2016, South Park was harsher on Hillary Clinton than it was on Donald Trump. (Trump, incidentally, has appeared as himself only once, in 2001, as one of several celebrity investors brought in to view a machine invented by Mr. Garrison.)

      "text": "Baker, O’Donnell undeserving of Gold Star attention By tweet Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker speaks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing to discuses ways to stabilize health insurance markets​, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) \nGov. Charlie Baker loves words that start with the letter “d”, and not just the one that he should have already embraced, which is “Democrat.” \nIn case you missed it, the Republican In Name Only (RINO) governor took yet another swipe at Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he found the president’s telephone conversation with a Florida Gold Star widow “incredibly disgraceful and discouraging and depressing.” \nNaturally, Tall Deval has no idea what was actually said in the conversation, or the context, but he’s… distressed, you might say. It used to be that Baker was merely “disappointed” in the president, but as the 2018 election nears, he’s upped the decibel level, to dust off another “d” word. \nA year ago, before the presidential election, he smugly announced that he would be blanking the top line on the ballot. This, Faker Baker declared to various reporters, was either “hugely disappointing” or “extremely disappointing.” \nSince the inauguration, the House’s vote to repeal Obamacare has “disappointed” him, while Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord left the governor “very disappointed.” \nTo be fair, for Tall Deval, disappointment comes from every political direction. Obama’s decision last year on the offshore “national-monuments” designation “deeply disappointed” him. At the State House, he has found both declining state tax revenues and hack state-college presidents walking away with $335,000 cash payouts to be “disappointing.” A decision to let corrupt pols keep their ill-gotten state pensions left Tall Deval “extremely disappointed.” \nIn June I wrote about Charlie’s string of disappointing disappointments, and he subsequently dialed back his use of his favorite “d” word, although the president’s statements about Charlottesville in August “deeply disappointed” the depressed demi-Democrat. \nBut I think this latest denunciation of the president is a harbinger of things to come in Tall Deval’s upcoming campaign. And may I suggest another “d” word for the Baker reelection effort – “disgust.” It’s already in his dictionary for dummies—a year ago he found the president “not only inappropriate but outrageous and disgusting.” \nRemember that word, disgusting. You read it here first. \nTall Deval, of course, went to Harvard, and you know that ancient axiom: “You can always tell a Harvard man, but you can’t tell him much.” \nHarvard’s motto used to start with a “V” – Veritas – and it still does, only now the phrase is “Virtue Signaling.” \nCharlie’s not the only Harvard man in public life living up to the V phrase. How about Lawrence O’Donnell, ’74, five years ahead of Tall Deval? \nIn case you missed it, and I’m guessing you did, the tough street kid from St. Seb’s went off on a rant this week on MSNBC, and this time he wasn’t slurring Mormons or screaming, “Stop the hammering!” at a blue-collar studio work crew. \nThis time O’Donnell was trying to class-shame Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, for his defense of the president. Sounding like a busing-era bow-tied swell from Brookline or Lincoln, O’Donnell sniffed that he “knows” Oak Square, Brighton, which Kelly came out of, because he comes from an “identical” neighborhood. \nReally? Kelly’s father was a mailman, O’Donnell’s a lawyer. In the early 70’s, as O’Donnell was adjusting his cravat, sipping brandies Alexander and tossing off precious bon mots in the Harvard Lampoon, Kelly was serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. Yeah, they have identical backgrounds all right. \nO’Donnell also said that Kelly went to “segregated schools.” The future general graduated the now-closed St. Mary’s High School in Waltham – if O’Donnell is accusing the Christian Brothers of being racists, that’s an even more scurrilous attack than he made against the Mormons a few years back. \nAnd for that matter, how many blacks were in the St. Sebastian’s Class of ’70? \nBy the way, I’m sure that when Trump was going after the Gold Star father Khizr Khan last year, O’Donnell was slamming the future president as the worst person in the world. But now O’Donnell casually dismisses a different Gold Star father as a racist, even though he knows absolutely nothing about Kelly, let alone what’s in his heart. \nBut lifelong pampered puke O’Donnell isn’t engaging in hate speech, he’s speaking truth to power. Just ask him. The PC hypocrisy here – not to mention the classism – is so thick you could cut it with a knife. \nI’ll bet Lawrence O’Donnell loves Charlie Baker. They have so much in common. Dim dismal Democrat demagogues.

(ABC News via AP) \nWASHINGTON (AP/Meredith) — The widow of a fallen soldier criticized President Donald Trump Monday over his condolence call last week, saying she was angered by his tone and that he couldn't remember her husband's name. Trump quickly responded on Twitter that he'd been \"very respectful\" and spoke the name \"without hesitation.\" \nMonday's harsh exchange was the latest in an ongoing dispute over how Trump responded to the deaths of four service members in the African nation of Niger. I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017 \nMyeshia Johnson, La David Johnson's widow, spoke on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" It was her first interview after a Democratic congresswoman accused Trump of being callous in the call by telling the widow that her husband \"knew what he signed up for.\" \nJohnson confirmed Wilson's account, saying the congresswoman was a longtime friend who was with the family in the car when Trump called Tuesday and listened on speakerphone. She said she had asked for the call to be put on speakerphone so relatives with her could hear. \n\"The president said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyway,\" Johnson said. She added: \"The only way he could remember my husband's name was he told me he had my husband's report in front of him and that's when he actually said La David.\" \"Whatever [ @RepWilson ] said was not fabricated. What she said was 100% correct.\" - widow of Sgt. La David Johnson on Pres. Trump's call pic.twitter.com/fOAmT7c0Bk — Good Morning America (@GMA) October 23, 2017 \nTrump, who had accused Rep. Frederica Wilson of fabricating the statement, fired back on Twitter, saying: \"I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!\" \nBut Johnson offered a different version. \n\"I heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husband's name and that's what hurt me the most, because if my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risked his life for our country why can't you remember his name,\" she said. \"And that's what made me upset and cry even more because my husband was an awesome soldier.\" \"[Pres. Trump] couldn't remember my husband's name. ... That's what hurt me the most.\" - Myeshia Johnson, widow of Sgt. La David Johnson pic.twitter.com/px5io2RbJB — Good Morning America (@GMA) October 23, 2017 \nThe conflict drew criticism from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who said on \"The View\" Monday: \"we should not be fighting about a brave American who lost his life.\" \nJohnson also said she has received little information about her husband's death and complained she has not been able to see his body. \n\"I need to see him so I will know that that is my husband. I don't know nothing they won't show me a finger, a hand,\" she said. \"I know my husband's body from head to toe.\" \nThe four U.S. soldiers were killed Oct. 4 in Niger when they were attacked by militants tied to the Islamic State. Confusion over what happened has dogged Trump, who was silent about the deaths for more than a week. \nAsked last Monday about his silence, Trump credited himself with doing more to honor the dead and console their families than any of his predecessors. His subsequent boast that he reaches out personally to all families of the fallen was contradicted by interviews with family members, some of whom had not heard from Trump at all. \nThe conflict continued Tuesday with Wilson criticizing the condolence call to Johnson. It escalated as she continued to attack the administration and Trump fired off insulting tweets, calling her \"wacky\" and accusing her of \"SECRETLY\" listening to the phone call. The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2017 \nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly entered the fray Thursday. The retired Marine general asserted that the congresswoman had delivered a 2015 speech at an FBI field office dedication in which she \"talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building,\" rather than keeping the focus on the fallen agents for which it was named. \nVideo of the speech contradicted his recollection, however. And on Sunday Wilson asked Kelly to apologize. Speaking on MSNBC's \"AM Joy,\" she called Kelly a \"puppet of the president\" and accused him of character assassination. \nJohnson said Monday that Wilson's account was accurate. \n\"Whatever Ms. Wilson said was not fabricated,\" she said. \"What she said was 100 percent correct. It was Master Sgt. Neil, me, my aunt, my uncle and the driver and Ms. Wilson in the car, the phone was on speaker phone. Why would we fabricate something like that?\" \nAsked if she had a message for the president, Johnson replied: \"No. I don't have nothing to say to him.\" Popular Stories",

      "text": "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2017 Snoop Dogg has again used his music in order to attack President Donald Trump, with the release of a new song entitled “Make America Crip Again.”The rapper — real name is Calvin Broadus Jr. — says in the opening lines of the song that “the president said he wants to make America great again.” F*ck - Sh*t - America - Crip “F*ck that sh*t, we’re going to make America crip again,” it continues.The song then takes aim at Trump’s comments on the scandal currently engulfing the NFL, in which he called for football players who decide to take a knee during the National Anthem to be fired, and also defends former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who popularized the form of Anthem protest during the 2016-17 season.

      "text": "Top US general reveals new info on Niger ambush Posted: Updated: \nBy Zachary Cohen CNN \nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- The US troops attacked in Niger were on their way back to their operating base when they were ambushed by 50 ISIS fighters, according to Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, who provided a timeline of the attack on Monday. \nFour US and five Nigerien soldiers were killed and two Americans were wounded in the attack that occurred on October 4, but details of what happened remain murky more than two weeks after the incident as investigators work to determine precisely what happened, a US official has told CNN. \nDuring the Pentagon briefing Monday, Dunford clarified that the US troops requested additional support about an hour after the firefight began. \nRemotely piloted aircraft arrived overhead within minutes of the request for help. French Mirage jets arrived on the scene approximately one hour later -- two hours after the troops made initial contact with enemy forces. \n\"It's important to note when they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgment would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support,\" Dunford said. \"And so well we'll find out in the investigation exactly why it took an hour for them to call.\" \nDunford said there is no indication that the US troops were operating outside their orders at the time of the ambush. \n\"I don't have any indication right now to believe or to know that they did anything other than operate within the orders that they were given,\" Dunford said. \"That's what the investigation's all about. So I think anyone that speculates about what special operations forces did or didn't do is doing exactly that, they're speculating.\" \nStill, Dunford said the military will be investigating if the planned reconnaissance mission changed. \n\"It was planned as a reconnaissance mission. What happened after they began to execute, in other words, did the mission change? That is one of the questions that's being asked. It's a fair question but I can't tell you definitively the answer to that question. But, yes, we've seen the reports, we've seen the speculation,\" he said. \nOne US soldier, Sgt. La David Johnson, was separated from his 12-member team as it was ambushed by 50 ISIS fighters, and his body was recovered 48 hours later nearly a mile away from the central scene of the ambush in Niger, four administration officials familiar with the early assessment of what happened had told CNN on Friday. \nDunford said Monday that he could not definitely confirm reports that Johnson was found nearly a mile away but that those details would come to light as part of the investigation. \n\"I think we owe the families and American people transparency,\" Dunford said. \nUnanswered questions \nThat commitment to providing more information to the families of fallen soldiers -- and the American people -- comes as lawmakers continue to raise questions over exactly what transpired in Niger and the extent of US military involvement in Africa. \nSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain has criticized the Pentagon and Trump administration for not being forthcoming about the attack -- threatening a subpoena last week -- and Defense Secretary James Mattis went to Capitol Hill on Friday to meet with both McCain and South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. \n\"One of the fights I'm having with the administration is the armed services committee is not getting enough information,\" McCain said Monday on ABC's \"The View.\"\"We deserve it.\" \nIn the aftermath of the ambush, several key lawmakers have said they didn't know the US had troops in Niger. \n\"I didn't know there was 1,000 troops in Niger,\" Graham said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday. \nBut the Pentagon and White House have previously notified Congress about the US mission in Niger several times this year. \nThe Pentagon is still looking at the exact circumstances of how and when Johnson became separated, but is emphasizing that the search for Johnson began immediately and dozens of US forces were quickly moved to Niger's capital Niamey to be ready to go into the field, which some did. \nJoint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie told reporters last week that US, French and Nigerien forces \"never left the battlefield\" until Johnson was found. \nExperts working for US Africa Command are trying to establish an hour-by-hour timeline of what happened as part of a comprehensive investigation that includes all the military branches and elements of US intelligence agencies that were involved in the mission. \nCNN previously reported that the French Mirage jets that arrived overhead within 30 minutes of the firefight to fly low passes in an attempt to disperse the attackers did not have permission to drop bombs. \nBut on Friday, US officials said that French jets did have authority to bomb but did not because pilots could not readily identify enemy forces in this firefight and did not want to risk hitting US and Nigerien troops. \nChange in tone? \nMonday's Pentagon briefing with Dunford offers a particularly striking change of tone from the public response of the Trump administration in the wake of the Niger attack. \nPresident Donald Trump's response to the attack has drawn some criticism, particularly his public feud with a Democratic congresswoman over a condolence call he made to Johnson's widow. \nOn Monday, Trump tweeted shortly after Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, discussed her disappointment with the call on \"Good Morning America\" Monday morning, saying the President stumbled on her husband's name and suggesting the only reason he knew it was because the report was right in front of him. \n\"I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!\" Trump tweeted. \nJohnson said she was distraught over Trump's alleged oversights during the call, which came as the Johnson family and Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, who is a friend of the family, rode in a limo to receive Johnson's body from Dover Air Force Base. \n\"(The call) made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice,\" she said. \nA White House official described Monday's briefing as an intentional effort to move beyond the heated rhetoric from all sides on this -- including from the West Wing. \nAn official said White House chief of staff John Kelly and people throughout the West Wing would be watching the briefing. \nKelly became embroiled in the controversy after taking to the White House podium last week to say that he was \"stunned\" by Wilson's decision to take to the press to criticize Trump for his call with a Gold Star widow, though he did not dispute Wilson's claim that Trump told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that he \"knew what he signed up for.\" \nKelly also claimed that Wilson took credit for securing \"$20 million\" in federal funding to build a new FBI field office in Miami in 2015, a claim that was proven erroneous by a video of the dedication ceremony posted Friday by the Sun Sentinel. \nAccusing her of being an \"empty barrel,\" Kelly said Wilson focused more on her own actions than the heroism of the two FBI agents for whom the new building had been named. \nKelly and Dunford maintain a close personal relationship and Kelly described Dunford as his best friend during the White House briefing last week. \nCNN's Jeff Zeleny, Barbara Starr and Ryan Brown contributed reporting \nTM &© 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "See all 8 prototypes for Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ border wall Posted: Updated: This combination of pictures shows the eight prototypes, slated for completion on Thursday. Guillermo Arias / AFP - Getty Images \nby JACOB SOBOROFF and ADAM EDELMAN \nThe future of President Donald Trump’s promised border wall lies in massive pieces in the California desert. \nNBC News got an early look at the eight nearly-finished prototypes, assembled near the existing fence along the U.S.-Mexico border miles outside San Diego, ahead of Thursday's deadline for the sections to be completed. \nFour of the prototypes are made from concrete and are competing for the chance to be used for the concrete portions of the wall. \nThe other four prototypes are made from non-concrete materials that are competing to be used for the stretches of barrier that can be seen through. \nAll are between 18 and 30 feet high. \nAfter the Thursday deadline passes, each sample will be tested on several criteria, officials said. \n“We're going to test it for breachability. For the subterranean aspect,” Roy Villareal, the Deputy Chief Patrol Agent of the San Diego Sector of CBP, told NBC News. “Can we dig under it? Can we cut through it? Can we scale over it?” \nAccording to a rendering released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, Trump’s wall has been envisioned as a multi-faceted barrier that features a concrete stretch facing the U.S. and a non-concrete stretch facing Mexico that would allow officials to see through it. \nThis image shows the concrete portion of the wall (E) would sit on the U.S.-facing side of an electronically monitored zone and another barrier (B) — which can be seen through — faces toward the Mexico. The monitoring zone would be about 150 feet wide and alert patrol agents if someone breached the initial border barrier. \nBut even with the prototypes nearing completion, the question over how the U.S. would fund the entire wall remains unanswered. Trump has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay for the wall; Mexico has said just as many times that it will not. \nThe White House’s proposed 2018 budget seeks $1.8 billion to begin building new sections of the wall and replace existing ones, which would include money to build 28 miles of levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley and 14 miles of new wall to replace fences south of San Diego. White House officials have suggested that the entire wall project could cost between $8 and $12 billion, but internal DHS assessments suggest the cost could be higher — as much as $21 billion. \nEven bigger questions, however, surround whether a massive wall would be effective. \nVillareal acknowledged “It's hard to gauge” whether a massive wall would cut historically-low apprehensions along the border. \n“There's always going to be some form or crime, or in this case, illegal migration,” he said. \nResidents of Mexico put it more bluntly. \n“I don't know why Donald Trump is so obsessed with this unnecessary waste of money,” Pedro Murillo, a man who tried to cross the border as young man, told NBC News from the Mexican side of the border. “Because, there will always be a way to cross.” WEEKLY CIRCULARS",

      "text": "Study: Climate change costs taxpayers billions By MICHAEL BIESECKER Associated Press 11:13 pm \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips Related Links",

Asked about the issue, Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Kevin Brady said: “I don’t want to get ahead of the committee. That will all be part of the tax reform bill.” \nAnd in response to whether Trump’s tweet changes in any way what the panel was planning to do, Brady replied only, “no.” \nRepublicans are scrambling to find new revenue sources to pay for anticipated tax cuts exceeding $1 trillion. A proposal to eliminate the widely used federal deduction for state and local taxes has run into heavy opposition from GOP House members from high-tax states, threatening the enactment of tax legislation that Republicans deem essential to retaining their majority in next year’s elections. \nTrump pledged in a tweet there will be “no change” to tax incentives for the 401(k) retirement programs. \nThe plan crafted by Trump and Republican leaders calls for steep tax cuts for corporations and potentially individuals, a doubling of the standard deduction used by most Americans, shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, and the repeal of inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. The child tax credit would be increased and the tax system would be simplified; most Americans would be able to file their income taxes on a postcard, according to the plan. \nCrucial details of the plan have yet to be worked out, notably what income levels would fit with each tax bracket. \nWith the possibility of the state and local deduction being at least partly preserved, some Republican lawmakers were considering limiting the amount workers could save in 401(k) retirement accounts. \n“It was a trial balloon and it crashed,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. “They’re struggling to find legitimate offsets” for tax cuts. \n“Everyone has been promised they are going to be better off with tax reform and that’s really hard to do in a fiscally responsible way,” Riedl said. \nEmployees’ earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren’t taxed until retirement; pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-preferred status. That cost the government $82.7 billion in lost revenue in the recent budget year ending Sept. 30, 2016 – a potentially juicy target for Republican tax-cutters. \nWith 55 million U.S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class. \n“This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!” Trump tweeted. “There will be NO change to your 401(k).” \nAppearing with Ivanka Trump in Pennsylvania, U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza echoed the president, telling the audience the retirement plans “will not be touched.” \nRep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the Trump-rejected proposal on retirement plans: “There are still some dials that do have to be turned. This is a major effort and when you dial one thing you have to look at another.” \nHouse Republicans will be working to pass a budget this week so they can turn their attention to the tax overhaul. Trump warned Sunday that action on tax reform is crucial to avoiding political failure in 2018. He’ll work to rally support for the plan at the Capitol today. \nTrump personally implored House GOP members on a conference call to swiftly adopt the budget that was passed last week by the Senate, with the hope of clearing the way for what he described as historic tax cuts. \nTrump told the lawmakers they were on the verge of doing something historic, according to one Republican official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what was intended as a private update for members. \nAnother GOP aide familiar with the conversation said Trump told the members again and again that the party would pay a steep price in next year’s midterm elections if it failed to pass his plan. \nThe Senate last week passed a budget plan that includes rules that will allow Republicans to get tax legislation through the Senate without Democratic votes or fear of a Democratic filibuster. House Republicans signaled Friday they would simply accept the Senate plan to avoid any potential delay on the tax measure. \nRepublicans are desperate to rack up a legislative win after a series of embarrassing failures despite the party controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. Topping the list: their stalled attempts to pass legislation repealing and replacing “Obamacare.” If tax overhaul legislation doesn’t pass, many in the party fear a complete rout in 2018. \n___ \nAP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and AP writers Jill Colvin, Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.

      "text": "RICHBORO, Pa. -- At the end of Monday's town hall meeting on her father's tax reform plan at a senior center in Richboro, Ivanka Trump flashed a grin at the audience. \"Is there anything more invigorating,\" she asked, \"than getting out of Washington?\"\nIt was the most Trumpian thing she'd said all day, after a session spent soberly discussing the merits -- but not too many of the details -- of the Republican plan to overhaul the tax code.\nIvanka Trump, a senior White House adviser as well as presidential progeny, characterized the plan as an improvement for working-class families -- in particular a proposed expansion of the child tax credit, which she advocated on the campaign trail.\nTrump said she was pushing to have that tax credit made refundable -- which analysts have said could go a long way toward helping low- and middle-income families defray the costs of raising a child. But the administration has not outlined some key elements of that plan, including how much it plans to expand the credit. On Monday, Ivanka Trump didn't get that far, either.\nWith moderator Nan Hayworth, a former House member from New York, and U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza, Trump spent about an hour conversing with a crowd of around 200 at the James Kinney Senior Center. The women on stage talked about fiscal issues facing ordinary Americans: how complicated it can be to file taxes, how many Americans don't have more than a few hundred dollars saved in case of an emergency, and how important it is to prepare students for jobs in a technology-driven economy.\nBut, Trump said, the administration is also banking on cutting the corporate tax rate, which it believes will spur growth and trickle down to workers. The administration wants to keep new businesses in the country, she said. \"Younger entrepreneurs, as they're assessing the global dynamics around where they should start and headquarter their businesses, it's not this city vs. that city,\" Trump said. \"It's this country vs. that country, and as a young person is starting their entrepreneurial endeavor, there's a lot more latitude to pick up and move.\"\nCarranza nodded, then noted how many recent college graduates have defaulted on their student loans.\n\"A rising tide,\" Trump said, \"lifts all boats.\"\nShe said the administration's focus on deregulation works in tandem with its tax plan, designed to boost the economy by rescinding industry regulations that people were \"losing sleep over.\"\nLegislatively, though, her father's administration was \"laser-focused\" on tax reform, she said. No tax bill has yet been written, and the provisions under discussion are subject to change. For instance, on Monday, President Donald Trump promised on Twitter to leave 401(k) plans alone. Republican lawmakers had been considering placing limits on the popular retirement benefit's tax breaks as a way of helping to pay for tax cuts.\n After a week in which her father had pumped his tax plan in between sparring with critics over his handling of a bereavement call to a Gold Star widow and tweeting about football players kneeling during the national anthem, the furthest Ivanka Trump strayed from taxes was a series of comments about the importance of women in science and technology fields, telling a pair of seventh-graders in the audience that it was an issue she was particularly passionate about.\nShe left a question about whether the tax plan could actually get passed in an increasingly divided Congress -- met with knowing laughter from the audience -- to Carranza: \"We're here to make sure it does get passed,\" the treasurer said, to applause.\nBucks County is represented by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a first-term Republican who has at times defied GOP leaders, including on President Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The president narrowly won Fitzpatrick's 8th District, 48.2 percent to 48 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to calculations by the political website Daily Kos.\nA small group of protesters waved signs outside the senior center before Ivanka Trump's arrival; Lois Pflueger, 67, who voted for President Trump in the primaries but switched to the Democratic Party last year, said she had heard about the event on Facebook and made a sign for her first protest. She was worried about a number of the administration's policies, but is \"infuriated\" about the tax plan's proposal to cut the estate tax, which didn't get a mention at the town hall. High-income estates \"are the ones that should have to be paying,\" she said.\nInside, attendees said they had enjoyed the event and the chance to get close to Ivanka Trump: \"She's always poised and perfect,\" said Joan Cullen, a school board member from the Pennridge School District. She said she was particularly struck by the need to simplify the tax code: \"It needs to be something we can all navigate,\" she said. As for the rest of the news that's surrounded Ivanka's father this week? \"Trump is Trump,\" she said. \"We have to start looking at separating his missteps on a personal level from the work he's doing.\"\n(c)2017 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "Trump Comments Concern Judge, Loom Over Bergdahl Sentencing October 24, 2017 5:15 AM Filed Under: Afghanistan , Col. Jeffery R. Nance , Desertion , life in prison , Military , Politics , President Donald Trump , Sentencing , Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \nFORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) — President Donald Trump’s criticism of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has become a factor in the soldier’s sentencing as a military judge weighs the president’s impact on public perception of military justice. \nThe judge deciding Bergdahl’s punishment for walking off his post in Afghanistan in 2009 heard defense arguments Monday that Trump recently reaffirmed his scathing criticism and is preventing a fair sentencing hearing. Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. \nThe judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, allowed the attorneys to question him about whether he was swayed by Trump’s comments, and responded that he would be fair. \n“I don’t have any doubt whatsoever that I can be fair and impartial in the sentencing in this matter,” Nance said. \nBut he had stern words for prosecutors about what effect Trump’s comments would have on public perception of the case. He indicated he would issue a ruling later on the defense request to dismiss the case because of Trump. \nWhile campaigning, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a “traitor” who deserved harsh punishment such as being shot. Nance previously ruled those comments were “disturbing” but didn’t amount to unlawful command influence and noted the statements were made before Trump became commander in chief. \nBut last week Trump addressed his past comments when asked about them at a news conference. He replied that he couldn’t say anything more about the case, “but I think people have heard my comments in the past.” That, the defense said, shows he harbors the same views now that he commands the military. \nProsecutors argued Trump’s comments didn’t reaffirm his campaign-trail criticism and were narrowly focused on answering a reporter. But Nance said he was having a “hard time” with prosecutors’ interpretation, noting public confidence in military courts was something he had to consider. \nNance said his interpretation was that Trump was essentially saying: “I shouldn’t comment on that, but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.” \nFormer Army lawyer Eric Carpenter said the judge has to worry not only about whether Trump has directly influenced the case, but also what the public thinks under a military justice concept called apparent unlawful command influence. Nance’s remarks Monday should resolve the question of whether Trump directly swayed the court, but the judge could still make concessions to the defense to address these concerns, Carpenter said. \n“It gives you a clue that he’s concerned about public appearance, and he can grant pretty significant remedies just to preserve the public’s faith in the system,” said Carpenter, who teaches law at Florida International University. \nCarpenter doubts the judge would dismiss the case outright, but said Nance could limit Bergdahl’s punishment because of Trump. \nThe White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be “resolved on its own facts.” White House representatives didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Monday. \nBergahl’s sentencing, set to begin Monday, has been delayed until Wednesday because one of the defense attorneys wasn’t available until then, the judge said. \nBergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected. \nNance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl’s willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him. \nBergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Barack Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.——– \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Why does it matter in the Robert Mueller investigation? What is money-laundering? \nPut simply: money-laundering turns \"dirty\" money \"clean\" — making proceeds from criminal activity usable without drawing the attention of law enforcement. \nJohn Cassara, a money-laundering expert who worked for the State Department and the Department of Treasury for more than 25 years, says money launderers work through a three-step system. \n1. Placement: This is the first time that money acquired through a crime — stolen, say, or through drug or human trafficking — enters the financial system. The cash can be blended into a legitimate business' cash flow and receipts, or deposited in small amounts to banks for later transfer. This is where launderers are most vulnerable to being caught, says Cassara, as banks and financial institutions have a number of tools to try to catch suspicious activity. \nIntel, for instance, just announced new artificial intelligence software that monitors \"transactions and suggestive personality behaviors\" to catch would-be launderers, according to Axios . \n2. Layering: The second step is where a money launderer covers his or her tracks. By transferring the money between companies and accounts in different places, the goal here is to make it difficult for law enforcement to follow the trail because of jurisdictional issues and transparency laws. \nMany countries and even some states require very little personal information to start a company, leading bad actors to start what are called \"shell companies\" — companies without any purpose other than to be a disguising vehicle for money to change hands. \nBy the time someone is spending money in the United States, for example, it might have been transferred from Cyprus, having been transferred from Ukraine, having been transferred from, say, Russia, where it might have been stolen or received as payment in the drug or human trafficking trade. \n\"You can also layer it by switching it from cash, to gold, to cyber, to commodities,\" Cassarra said. \n3. Integration: Once the money has been moved, moved and moved again, it's time to legitimize it. Cassara says luxury items, property or stock investments are all options for a criminal to park the rewards of the ill-gotten gains. \nFor example, there are whole sections of the richest sections of London owned by wealthy foreigners that mostly sit empty, leading locals to wonder whether they're at the end of a pipeline of illicit money. Real estate in hot markets such as London or New York is a good investment for anyone because it seldom loses value and can often be quickly resold in legitimate transactions, freeing up cash. In the U.K., people call this phenomenon \" Lights Out London .\" \n\"Outside of crimes of passion, for example — murder committed in a jealous rage — why do criminals and criminal organizations commit crime?\" Cassara asks rhetorically. \"Greed.\" How big a deal is money-laundering? \n\"Essentially, with any crime that generates money, the criminal needs to launder the money in order to use it,\" says Stefanie Ostfeld, the deputy head of the U.S. office for Global Witness , a nonprofit focused on exposing economic networks that breed corruption. \n\"The issue with money-laundering is it tends to take two to money launder: You have the criminal who committed the original crime, but then you also have the bank, the lawyer, the accountant that actually moved the money into the financial system.\" \nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between 2-5 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) is laundered each year. Even if you take the lowest end of that guess, it's around $800 billion. \nOstfeld says the root of the problem is lax laws that make it easy to create businesses, or shell companies, with anonymous or hard-to-trace owners as part of the layering process. \n\"Time and time again, our investigations highlight the same problem,\" Ostfeld said. \"That's sham companies that allow those who steal state funds to move it undetected through the international financial system.\" \nPlaces like Jersey and the Cayman Islands have reputations as shell company havens, but an article published earlier this year in The Atlantic , found the U.S. to be \"perhaps the foremost shell-company provider globally.\" \nDelaware, for instance, is famous around the world for being an easy place to set up a shell company. In 2012, the state had more corporate entities than people, according to The New York Times . And as NPR reported , at least one entity linked with Russian advocates who want the U.S. to roll back sanctions on Moscow is chartered in Delaware. Are governments trying to crack down? \nOver the past 50 years, the U.S. has made policy changes toward curbing money-laundering. Notably, Congress passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, which requires banks to report cash transactions over $10,000. \nIn 1986, the Money Laundering Control Act made money-laundering a federal crime, and laws in the 1990s pushed financial institutions to begin filing reports on suspicious activity. \nStill, Cassara says despite the 18 million-or-so pieces of \"financial intelligence\" that will be filed in 2017, less than 1 percent of the money that's laundered will be recovered. \n\"To be a money launderer today, you'd have to be either very stupid or very unlucky to get caught,\" Cassara said. \"The magnitude is really high but the sobering part is that our success rate is staggeringly low.\" \nOstfeld said that's because despite having tools at their disposal to quell the money's movement, law enforcement and banks have not made it a priority to do so. \n\"Bankers are doing the minimum they can get away with,\" Ostfeld said. \"What people don't really understand is that corruption doesn't just hurt people 'over there'... It actually impacts so many aspects of life, we just don't see it because it's one piece of the puzzle. \n\"But then you take a step back and you realize it's actually what joins all these crimes together.\" Why does it matter in the Robert Mueller investigation? \nIt's not a secret that Trump and those close to his campaign have had some financial ties to Russia. \n\"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,\" as Donald Trump Jr. said at a real estate conference in 2008 . \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\" \nAnd it's also no secret that corruption in Russia means oligarchs there can't always keep money in Russian banks. They move it overseas, to Europe or the United Kingdom or the U.S., for use in buying real estate or other purposes. Often, they have help: One of the Russians who met with Trump Jr. in June 2016 in Trump Tower, Irakly Kaveladze, was said to have set up some 2,000 shell companies in the United States . \n\"Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in, and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties,\" wrote Craig Unger, in a long feature for The New Republic . \n\"Whatever his knowledge about the source of his wealth, the public record makes clear that Trump built his business empire in no small part with a lot of dirty money from a lot of dirty Russians.\" \nRodgers, of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity, says it may not be Trump who should necessarily worry about money-laundering charges at this point. The president may have good reason to fear, according to some reports, but the person in the most pressing legal jeopardy could be Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. \nMcClatchy reported in August that Mueller was \"zeroing in\" on Manafort's finances. \n\"I personally think they're looking at money-laundering for Manafort,\" Rodgers said. \"It looks like they may get something there, given the sheer number of accounts he has, and the number of transactions involved.\" \nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment for this story. No one has been charged with any crime so far in the Russia imbroglio, and Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Russia. \nAll the same, observers including Rodgers say Mueller may try to use the threat of financial charges to flip Manafort into being a witness against others in the campaign. \n\"Anyone facing serious charges for money-laundering and tax offenses involving undisclosed foreign bank accounts would have huge incentives to trade cooperation for prison time,\" Jonathan Winer, the State Department's top money-laundering expert during the Clinton administration, told McClatchy. \nDetails about how deep Manafort's ties go continue to emerge. \nNBC reported recently on a $26 million loan between Manafort and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, making the pair's total financial relationship about $60 million over the past decade. \n\"Money launderers frequently will disguise payments as loans,\" Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor, told NBC. \"You can call it a loan, you can call it 'Mary Jane.' If there's no intent to repay it, then it's not really a loan. It's just a payment.\" \nWhile there aren't any charges yet, Mueller's prosecutors reportedly told Manafort in September that they plan at some point to indict him. Copyright 2017 NPR.

      "text": "President Trump jumped ahead of Republicans' long-planned tax reform maneuvering Monday with a morning tweet that ruled out a proposal under consideration to change the tax treatment of retirement savings.\nAt the moment, Republicans on the House and Senate committees responsible for taxes are supposed to be working out the tax reform details, after their leadership negotiated for months with the Trump administration over a broad framework. The White House has promised that it will be flexible regarding those details.\n\"Things that aren't agreed to in advance, they go into committee, and that's the process that starts\" this week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday on CBS.\nYet Trump dismissed the possibility of a major provision that Republicans might have used to raise revenues for the tax rate reductions he has called for.\nThe specific measure in question is regarded by some experts as a budgetary gimmick, rather than a serious policy change.\nRepublicans were considering lowering the limits on pre-tax contributions to 401(k)s, which are funds that are taxed when they are withdrawn in retirement. Instead, savers would be directed toward Roth IRA-style savings vehicles, in which funds are contributed on an after-tax basis, but then can be withdrawn tax-free upon retirement. Such a switch would make it appear that the government was raising more money in the 10-year timeframe Congress uses to assess the cost of legislation, even though over a long period time it might not make a difference.\nTrump's tweet aimed at cutting off the debate came just days after several reports that the switch was under serious consideration.\nThere will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017 \nJill Hoffman, a tax lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group, suggested that Trump's tweet was driven simply by a \"pretty organic response\" to the negative reaction to those reports.\n\"It sends a strong signal that anything that they do in the context of tax reform that could cut or change retirement savings ... is going to be problematic politically,\" said Hoffman, whose group represents financial firms that manage tax-privileged accounts.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer took advantage of the surprise comment from Trump to criticize the GOP tax reform effort. \"[T]he fact that Republicans were even considering raiding America's retirement savings to pay for a giant tax cut for corporations, states, shows just how backward their plan is,\" the New Yorker said in a statement.\nSchumer's Republican counterparts were more reserved about the impact of Trump's tweet.\n\"At least for right now, it's in everybody's best interest to keep their gunpowder dry and talk about kind of the high-level stuff and then let the committees get in and start working the details,\" said South Dakota's John Thune, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.\nThune noted that to assess the effect of ending any particular tax break, it's necessary to also see the corresponding benefits, such as lower rates, and assess the plan as a whole.\nNevertheless, he acknowledged, \"If that's something that's a non-negotiable for him, that'll probably shape the thinking of people up here.\"\nIn the early going, congressional Republicans have encountered predictable concerns from within their party about plans to eliminate popular breaks. Blue-state Republicans in the House, for instance, have raised the possibility of voting against a plan that cuts the state and local tax deduction, which disproportionately benefits their constituents.\nSome of the party's fiscal hawks are concerned that too many such revenue-raisers — or to regular people, the elimination of a tax break — might prove too politically difficult.\n\"I just don't hear anybody talking about that,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., talking about the need to raise trillions of dollars in eliminated tax breaks to pay for the tax reform package. \"I hear about tax cuts. But it doesn't work without the base-broadeners.\"\nNevertheless, at least one lawmaker stated that the plans for the tax package wouldn't be determined by Trump's Twitter intervention.\nRep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, declined to say whether he planned to lower maximum contributions to 401(k)s in the legislative text. But, asked by a reporter whether Trump's tweet would change what the committee will do, Brady simply responded, \"No.\"",

Female members of the Congressional Black Caucus called on Kelly to apologize to Wilson. \nSanders — questioned about the matter at a forum Monday with White House reporters — says she didn’t think Kelly was wrong “and therefore I don’t think he should offer an apology.”",

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court... \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Philadelphia's former top prosecutor is scheduled to be sentenced after pleading guilty in a corruption scandal. \nCourt records show that Seth Williams is set to appear in federal court on Tuesday afternoon. He faces up to five years in prison for a single count of accepting a bribe from a businessman. \nThe ex-district attorney was disbarred by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last week. \nThe two-term Democrat pleaded guilty in June, two weeks into a trial that included damaging testimony about a stream of money and gifts showered on him. A federal judge said he \"sold\" his office and ordered him immediately jailed. \nWilliams was Philadelphia's first black district attorney. \nHe spent years as an assistant prosecutor and was previously tasked with rooting out corruption as the city's inspector general.",

      "text": "A A \nSouth Park airs on Comedy Central \nLast year, just days after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone told a reporter that the next season of their show wouldn’t take aim at Trump, because “satire has become reality.” After 20 years of skewering public figures from Steve Jobs to Donald Rumsfeld to Britney Spears, Parker and Stone seemed stumped. What happens when you flip off the principal, Stone mused in an interview in May, and he flips you off right back? “The comedian pushes the button,” Parker asserted. “That’s the natural order of things.” \nHe knows button pushing. Since 1997, Parker and Stone (but, let’s be honest, mostly Parker) have riled the world as proudly flippant “equal-opportunity offenders.’ ’ Last season, their 20th, tracked the real-life events of the presidential election (the show produces new installments week by week), casting its two presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton and a Trump-like Mr. Garrison — as a choice between a “Turd Sandwich” and a “Giant Douche.” South Park ’s early seasons, which premiered in the dawn of the internet and long before the existence of social media, worked political material around the cartoon’s main conceit of four potty-mouthed boys (Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, voiced by Parker and Stone) growing up in small-town Colorado. Before algorithms gave TV writers the incentive to rip highly clickable stories from the headlines, and long before Trump triggered a never-ending global crisis that begs constant attention, South Park was largely a show about — and that reflected the sensibility of — white American boyhood. \nThat’s not to say it hasn’t been jubilantly controversial from the get-go. South Park is notorious for reveling in its naughtiness — Isaac Hayes, who voiced the character of Chef, quit in protest of a 2005 episode that lampooned his religion, Scientology. But the series oozed a fatuous resistance to soapbox statements, a pubescent reflex that reduced every vaguely political plot to jokes about shit and dicks. In the first episode to air after 9/11, titled “Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,” the takedown of America’s public enemy No. 1 starts with bin Laden’s pants coming down — and it takes half a dozen magnifying glasses to make out his penis. \nThere were political overtones before 9/11, of course; an episode from 2000, in which the town clashes over its racist flag — it depicts four white people hanging a black man, then it’s redesigned so that the four figures are multi-ethnic, with all five holding hands while, still, the black man hangs — is, per Parker, uncomfortably close to reality today. By the mid-2000s, the show had sharpened its focus on current events. In 2007, Cartman eyed the new Muslim kid in town suspiciously, convinced he’s a terrorist; because this is South Park and not 24 — whose countdown clock the episode parodies — Cartman tortures his new classmate’s parents by farting in their faces. \nIn that episode, which aired a couple of months after Hillary Clinton announced her intention to run in the 2008 presidential race, Cartman worries about a potential terrorist attack at a Hillary rally in South Park . Turns out Cartman is right: Terrorists have hidden a tiny nuclear device … in Hillary Clinton’s “snatch.” When one of her aides suggests they probe inside Senator Clinton — who’s drawn with exaggeratedly large hips — to see if they can defuse the nuke, a bomb expert declares, “I'm not sending any of my men in there.” \nSouth Park ’s laddish libertarian ethos shields it from complaints about insensitivity, of course; as many an alt-right acolyte could tell you, criticism slides off like milk on Teflon when you’re only in it for the lulz. And lest viewers worry that South Park had become too didactic, that episode ended with the revelation that it’s not the Muslim family that’s behind the attack; it’s America’s foundational enemy, the British, who are sailing toward the colonies in old-timey ships, clad in red coats and armed with muskets. It’s a textbook South Park twist, an expression of the show’s perennial anxiety about articulating, or appearing to articulate, a serious political critique. In the end, for better or worse, the show always pivots to fart in your face. \nThe fart in our face this season is the creators’ reluctance, at the halfway point at least, to take on Trump and his supporters. The season premiere, which aired a month after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, seemed poised to parody the specter of white nationalism, a topic the show has not shied away from in the past. But the episode dodges the issue of race almost entirely; angry white men screaming, “They terk er jerbs” march through the town carrying tiki torches and confederate flags, but even when they chant “You will not replace us,” they’re let off the hook — their target is corporate-backed automation. \nThe second episode, in which a panicked Tweek finds himself caught between North Korea’s nuclear arms program and the president’s tweets, is better; South Park has always been good at evoking the immediate aftermath of national tragedy, the slack-jawed, stunned stupor of people who have just realized something terrible has happened. In “Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,” Kyle’s mom is comatose on the couch, where she’s been watching CNN for eight weeks straight; in 2016, Parker and Stone rewrote in a single day the post-election episode they’d been working on; it opened with a familiar scene: an election-night party steeped in sorrow and disbelief. \nThe relative absence of Trump is disappointing for a show that loves to shit on power — and especially questionable considering South Park has never had a problem shitting on Hillary Clinton, a woman who has never been in as comparably powerful a position as Trump’s. The nuke bit wasn’t the first time Hillary appeared on the show: In a 2002 episode, a newscaster shows a picture of her and announces, “Her ass just keeps getting bigger and bigger.” She makes a brief cameo in 2009’s “Eat, Pray, Queef,” in which the men and boys of South Park record a charity single advocating a woman’s right to queef. \nAnd there she was in the episode that aired the day after the 2016 presidential election, “Oh, Jeez,” in which she schemes to stop the show’s Trump surrogate, Giant Douche, from taking office. “Oh, Jeez” also features a wizened Bill Clinton, who declares, “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch.” Even on Nov. 9, 2016, South Park was harsher on Hillary Clinton than it was on Donald Trump. (Trump, incidentally, has appeared as himself only once, in 2001, as one of several celebrity investors brought in to view a machine invented by Mr. Garrison.)

      "text": "Trump shoots down cuts to retirement limit By MARCY GORDON Associated Press 11:15 pm Caption Donald Trump \nWASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump shot down a possible approach for raising revenue to finance tax cuts in politically must-do legislation for the Republicans, promising Monday the popular 401(k) retirement program will be untouched. \nStill, the head of the House’s tax-writing committee indicated that changes to the 401(k) structure may still be on the table as Republicans push an ambitious timetable to get tax legislation written. Asked about the issue, Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Kevin Brady said: “I don’t want to get ahead of the committee. That will all be part of the tax reform bill.” \nAnd in response to whether Trump’s tweet changes in any way what the panel was planning to do, Brady replied only, “no.” \nRepublicans are scrambling to find new revenue sources to pay for anticipated tax cuts exceeding $1 trillion. A proposal to eliminate the widely used federal deduction for state and local taxes has run into heavy opposition from GOP House members from high-tax states, threatening the enactment of tax legislation that Republicans deem essential to retaining their majority in next year’s elections. \nTrump pledged in a tweet there will be “no change” to tax incentives for the 401(k) retirement programs. \nThe plan crafted by Trump and Republican leaders calls for steep tax cuts for corporations and potentially individuals, a doubling of the standard deduction used by most Americans, shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, and the repeal of inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. The child tax credit would be increased and the tax system would be simplified; most Americans would be able to file their income taxes on a postcard, according to the plan. \nCrucial details of the plan have yet to be worked out, notably what income levels would fit with each tax bracket. \nWith the possibility of the state and local deduction being at least partly preserved, some Republican lawmakers were considering limiting the amount workers could save in 401(k) retirement accounts. \n“It was a trial balloon and it crashed,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. “They’re struggling to find legitimate offsets” for tax cuts. \n“Everyone has been promised they are going to be better off with tax reform and that’s really hard to do in a fiscally responsible way,” Riedl said. \nEmployees’ earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren’t taxed until retirement; pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-preferred status. That cost the government $82.7 billion in lost revenue in the recent budget year ending Sept. 30, 2016 – a potentially juicy target for Republican tax-cutters. \nWith 55 million U.S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class. \n“This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!” Trump tweeted. “There will be NO change to your 401(k).” \nAppearing with Ivanka Trump in Pennsylvania, U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza echoed the president, telling the audience the retirement plans “will not be touched.” \nRep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the Trump-rejected proposal on retirement plans: “There are still some dials that do have to be turned. This is a major effort and when you dial one thing you have to look at another.” \nHouse Republicans will be working to pass a budget this week so they can turn their attention to the tax overhaul. Trump warned Sunday that action on tax reform is crucial to avoiding political failure in 2018. He’ll work to rally support for the plan at the Capitol today. \nTrump personally implored House GOP members on a conference call to swiftly adopt the budget that was passed last week by the Senate, with the hope of clearing the way for what he described as historic tax cuts. \nTrump told the lawmakers they were on the verge of doing something historic, according to one Republican official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what was intended as a private update for members. \nAnother GOP aide familiar with the conversation said Trump told the members again and again that the party would pay a steep price in next year’s midterm elections if it failed to pass his plan. \nThe Senate last week passed a budget plan that includes rules that will allow Republicans to get tax legislation through the Senate without Democratic votes or fear of a Democratic filibuster. House Republicans signaled Friday they would simply accept the Senate plan to avoid any potential delay on the tax measure. \nRepublicans are desperate to rack up a legislative win after a series of embarrassing failures despite the party controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. Topping the list: their stalled attempts to pass legislation repealing and replacing “Obamacare.” If tax overhaul legislation doesn’t pass, many in the party fear a complete rout in 2018. \n___ \nAP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and AP writers Jill Colvin, Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.

      "text": "Trump is attending the weekly Senate Republican lunch Tuesday in an attempt to gather support for a tax reform bill that has yet to be released. He’ll be in a closed-door lunch where many in the room are those he’s publicly attacked, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump has also feuded with, called the visit “a photo op.”\n“Tomorrow’s a photo op, nothing more nothing less. To read anything more into it would be spending a lot of time on something that shouldn’t be spent a lot of time on,” Corker said. “It’s going to be up and down for the next three years and that’s just the way it’s going to be. I don’t read anything into tomorrow other than a photo op.”\nSome Republicans on the Hill are skeptical of Trump’s party loyalty after instances where he openly attacked elected Republicans and members of the party's congressional leadership. His former top adviser, Steve Bannon, has declared an all-out “war” with the GOP establishment, vowing to run a primary candidate against nearly every sitting Senate Republican up for re-election in 2018.\nRepublicans are entering into a critical phase in their effort to pass tax reform. Some conservative members are going out on a limb, breaking their campaign promise and their principled stance of opposing any legislation that would add to the deficit in order to advance tax reform.\n“Am I feeling the pressure to get this done? Yes. Have I been willing to negotiate a little more generously because of that pressure? Yeah. That’s just shooting straight with you,” said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\nThe Senate passed their budget last week, a critical step in moving forward on tax legislation. The House is taking up the Senate’s budget this week, even though it adds to the deficit.\nHouse Republicans plan to move quickly on tax reform. They expect to unveil legislation within the next two weeks with a goal of passing it before Thanksgiving. But the Senate is likely to move more slowly, hoping to pass their bill before Christmas.\nTrump told House Republicans that the Senate needs to move more quickly because the longer they wait the more time people have to change their minds.\nWhile Trump urges party unity, he and his team have yet to reach out to two critical members of the Senate on the issue. Both Sens. McCain and Susan Collins, R-Maine, say that they have yet to speak with Trump or White House aides about tax reform.\nPlay\nFacebook Twitter Embed Bannon Explains Trump's America First Approach as 'Jacksonian' 2:51 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog “I had early on (had a meeting) with members of the president’s economic council but mainly I’ve been talking about my colleagues about it,” Collins said.\nWhile Trump impressed his Republican credentials in the call to House Republicans, he also knocked McCain, without naming him, for not voting for health care. And he told them that he’ll work to get the support of four Democrats from states that he won by 20 or 30 points.\nWhite House aides and the president have been heavily courting Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, all Democrats who are from states that Trump won and are up for reelection in 2018.\nAll three joined Trump at rallies in their respective states in recent months and attended meetings at the White House. Heitkamp and Manchin attended a bipartisan dinner at Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s house with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n“You keep asking us if we’re going to support it. I don’t know what ‘it’ is,” Heitkamp said of the unreleased bill.\nTrump warned Republicans that the 2018 elections will be a “bloodbath” if they don’t pass tax reform.",

      "text": "RICHBORO, Pa. -- At the end of Monday's town hall meeting on her father's tax reform plan at a senior center in Richboro, Ivanka Trump flashed a grin at the audience. \"Is there anything more invigorating,\" she asked, \"than getting out of Washington?\"\nIt was the most Trumpian thing she'd said all day, after a session spent soberly discussing the merits -- but not too many of the details -- of the Republican plan to overhaul the tax code.\nIvanka Trump, a senior White House adviser as well as presidential progeny, characterized the plan as an improvement for working-class families -- in particular a proposed expansion of the child tax credit, which she advocated on the campaign trail.\nTrump said she was pushing to have that tax credit made refundable -- which analysts have said could go a long way toward helping low- and middle-income families defray the costs of raising a child. But the administration has not outlined some key elements of that plan, including how much it plans to expand the credit. On Monday, Ivanka Trump didn't get that far, either.\nWith moderator Nan Hayworth, a former House member from New York, and U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza, Trump spent about an hour conversing with a crowd of around 200 at the James Kinney Senior Center. The women on stage talked about fiscal issues facing ordinary Americans: how complicated it can be to file taxes, how many Americans don't have more than a few hundred dollars saved in case of an emergency, and how important it is to prepare students for jobs in a technology-driven economy.\nBut, Trump said, the administration is also banking on cutting the corporate tax rate, which it believes will spur growth and trickle down to workers. The administration wants to keep new businesses in the country, she said. \"Younger entrepreneurs, as they're assessing the global dynamics around where they should start and headquarter their businesses, it's not this city vs. that city,\" Trump said. \"It's this country vs. that country, and as a young person is starting their entrepreneurial endeavor, there's a lot more latitude to pick up and move.\"\nCarranza nodded, then noted how many recent college graduates have defaulted on their student loans.\n\"A rising tide,\" Trump said, \"lifts all boats.\"\nShe said the administration's focus on deregulation works in tandem with its tax plan, designed to boost the economy by rescinding industry regulations that people were \"losing sleep over.\"\nLegislatively, though, her father's administration was \"laser-focused\" on tax reform, she said. No tax bill has yet been written, and the provisions under discussion are subject to change. For instance, on Monday, President Donald Trump promised on Twitter to leave 401(k) plans alone. Republican lawmakers had been considering placing limits on the popular retirement benefit's tax breaks as a way of helping to pay for tax cuts.\n After a week in which her father had pumped his tax plan in between sparring with critics over his handling of a bereavement call to a Gold Star widow and tweeting about football players kneeling during the national anthem, the furthest Ivanka Trump strayed from taxes was a series of comments about the importance of women in science and technology fields, telling a pair of seventh-graders in the audience that it was an issue she was particularly passionate about.\nShe left a question about whether the tax plan could actually get passed in an increasingly divided Congress -- met with knowing laughter from the audience -- to Carranza: \"We're here to make sure it does get passed,\" the treasurer said, to applause.\nBucks County is represented by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a first-term Republican who has at times defied GOP leaders, including on President Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The president narrowly won Fitzpatrick's 8th District, 48.2 percent to 48 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to calculations by the political website Daily Kos.\nA small group of protesters waved signs outside the senior center before Ivanka Trump's arrival; Lois Pflueger, 67, who voted for President Trump in the primaries but switched to the Democratic Party last year, said she had heard about the event on Facebook and made a sign for her first protest. She was worried about a number of the administration's policies, but is \"infuriated\" about the tax plan's proposal to cut the estate tax, which didn't get a mention at the town hall. High-income estates \"are the ones that should have to be paying,\" she said.\nInside, attendees said they had enjoyed the event and the chance to get close to Ivanka Trump: \"She's always poised and perfect,\" said Joan Cullen, a school board member from the Pennridge School District. She said she was particularly struck by the need to simplify the tax code: \"It needs to be something we can all navigate,\" she said. As for the rest of the news that's surrounded Ivanka's father this week? \"Trump is Trump,\" she said. \"We have to start looking at separating his missteps on a personal level from the work he's doing.\"\n(c)2017 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "Trump Comments Concern Judge, Loom Over Bergdahl Sentencing October 24, 2017 5:15 AM Filed Under: Afghanistan , Col. Jeffery R. Nance , Desertion , life in prison , Military , Politics , President Donald Trump , Sentencing , Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \nFORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) — President Donald Trump’s criticism of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has become a factor in the soldier’s sentencing as a military judge weighs the president’s impact on public perception of military justice. \nThe judge deciding Bergdahl’s punishment for walking off his post in Afghanistan in 2009 heard defense arguments Monday that Trump recently reaffirmed his scathing criticism and is preventing a fair sentencing hearing. Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. \nThe judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, allowed the attorneys to question him about whether he was swayed by Trump’s comments, and responded that he would be fair. \n“I don’t have any doubt whatsoever that I can be fair and impartial in the sentencing in this matter,” Nance said. \nBut he had stern words for prosecutors about what effect Trump’s comments would have on public perception of the case. He indicated he would issue a ruling later on the defense request to dismiss the case because of Trump. \nWhile campaigning, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a “traitor” who deserved harsh punishment such as being shot. Nance previously ruled those comments were “disturbing” but didn’t amount to unlawful command influence and noted the statements were made before Trump became commander in chief. \nBut last week Trump addressed his past comments when asked about them at a news conference. He replied that he couldn’t say anything more about the case, “but I think people have heard my comments in the past.” That, the defense said, shows he harbors the same views now that he commands the military. \nProsecutors argued Trump’s comments didn’t reaffirm his campaign-trail criticism and were narrowly focused on answering a reporter. But Nance said he was having a “hard time” with prosecutors’ interpretation, noting public confidence in military courts was something he had to consider. \nNance said his interpretation was that Trump was essentially saying: “I shouldn’t comment on that, but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.” \nFormer Army lawyer Eric Carpenter said the judge has to worry not only about whether Trump has directly influenced the case, but also what the public thinks under a military justice concept called apparent unlawful command influence. Nance’s remarks Monday should resolve the question of whether Trump directly swayed the court, but the judge could still make concessions to the defense to address these concerns, Carpenter said. \n“It gives you a clue that he’s concerned about public appearance, and he can grant pretty significant remedies just to preserve the public’s faith in the system,” said Carpenter, who teaches law at Florida International University. \nCarpenter doubts the judge would dismiss the case outright, but said Nance could limit Bergdahl’s punishment because of Trump. \nThe White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be “resolved on its own facts.” White House representatives didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Monday. \nBergahl’s sentencing, set to begin Monday, has been delayed until Wednesday because one of the defense attorneys wasn’t available until then, the judge said. \nBergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected. \nNance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl’s willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him. \nBergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Barack Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.——– \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

      "text": "FORT BRAGG, N.C. -- President Donald Trump's criticism of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has become a factor in the soldier's sentencing as a military judge weighs the president's impact on public perception of military justice. The judge deciding Bergdahl's punishment for walking off his post in Afghanistan in 2009 heard defense arguments Monday that Trump recently reaffirmed his scathing criticism and is preventing a fair sentencing hearing. Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, allowed the attorneys to question him about whether he was swayed by Trump's comments, and responded that he would be fair. \"I don't have any doubt whatsoever that I can be fair and impartial in the sentencing in this matter,\" Nance said. But he had stern words for prosecutors about what effect Trump's comments would have on public perception of the case. He indicated he would issue a ruling later on the defense request to dismiss the case because of Trump. While campaigning, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a \"traitor\" who deserved harsh punishment such as being shot. Nance previously ruled those comments were \"disturbing\" but didn't amount to unlawful command influence and noted the statements were made before Trump became commander in chief. But last week Trump addressed his past comments when asked about them at a news conference. He replied that he couldn't say anything more about the case, \"but I think people have heard my comments in the past.\" That, the defense said, shows he harbors the same views now that he commands the military. Prosecutors argued Trump's comments didn't reaffirm his campaign-trail criticism and were narrowly focused on answering a reporter. But Nance said he was having a \"hard time\" with prosecutors' interpretation, noting public confidence in military courts was something he had to consider. Nance said his interpretation was that Trump was essentially saying: \"I shouldn't comment on that, but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.\" Former Army lawyer Eric Carpenter said the judge has to worry not only about whether Trump has directly influenced the case, but also what the public thinks under a military justice concept called apparent unlawful command influence. Nance's remarks Monday should resolve the question of whether Trump directly swayed the court, but the judge could still make concessions to the defense to address these concerns, Carpenter said. \"It gives you a clue that he's concerned about public appearance, and he can grant pretty significant remedies just to preserve the public's faith in the system,\" said Carpenter, who teaches law at Florida International University. Carpenter doubts the judge would dismiss the case outright, but said Nance could limit Bergdahl's punishment because of Trump. The White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be \"resolved on its own facts.\" White House representatives didn't respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Bergahl's sentencing, set to begin Monday, has been delayed until Wednesday because one of the defense attorneys wasn't available until then, the judge said. Bergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected. Nance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl's willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him. Bergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured soon after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Barack Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. ____",

But economic development officials there say they plan to be aggressive in pursuing the project. “We will work with CEG and others to develop a proposal for Amazon,” says Marty Vanags, president of… more Amazon is still building out… more Anthony Bolante | PSBJ – Dallas Business Journal Oct 23, 2017, 2:25pm CDT Amazon.com said its call for second headquarters proposals received 238 bids from cities and regions in 54 states and provinces across North America. The Seattle-based internet retailer and cloud computing giant launched its contest for a $5 billion, 50,000-employee \"HQ2\" in September. Amazon asked North American governments to submit bids for the campus including infrastructure data, demographics and potential subsidies. The window to submit proposals closed Thursday. Amazon said the bids include 43 U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The only U.S. states not represented in the bids were Arkansas, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. Dallas-Fort Worth submitted a unified bid that included at least 35 sites in a dozen North Texas cities . The proposal highlighted the region's business-friendly climate, cost of living and an undisclosed amount of economic incentives. “Our goal is not to win the project with this RFP and this response,” said Brandom Gengelbach, executive vice president of economic development for the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce. “Our goal is to get into the ‘yes’ pile, and know that there will probably another one, two or three rounds, and to let Amazon know we stand willing and ready and able to make that next step.” Other HQ2 hopefuls used gimmicks to try to lure Amazon. A city council in Georgia voted to de-annex 345 acres of land and ask the state to rename it \"the city of Amazon\" if the company chooses the site for HQ2. Tuscon, Arizona sent a 21-foot saguaro cactus to Seattle as a gift. Calgary, Alberta covered the company's Seattle campus with sidewalk chalk. Amazon's HQ2 seems to promise economic development for the winning city in the form of high-paying jobs, real estate deals and a vibrant technology ecosystem. It's also likely to raise rents and increase traffic. The company said it plans to announce a second headquarters next year. Through hundreds of interviews and public records requests , The Business Journal recently detailed Amazon's playbook for expanding the distribution network that's key to the internet retailer's continued growth.

The Thurgood Marshall College Fund is the nation's largest organization exclusively representing the Black College Community. \nAs President & CEO, Williams will lead the nonprofit's 47 member-schools. These schools represent nearly 300,000 students from America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominantly Black Institutions, and enroll nearly 80 percent of all students attending HBCUs, according to a press release. He will be charged with building new strategic partnerships to secure millions of dollars creating scholarships, enhancing capacity, expanding HBCU research initiatives, and stimulating innovative programming. Williams replaces Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., who served as TMCF's President & CEO for seven years before accepting the position as President & CEO of the Society of Human Resource Management. \nCalling his time at Delaware State University \"the most defining decade of my professional life,\" Williams recalled the pride he has taken in leading the institution through its greatest period of growth and opportunity. \"My family and I are deeply indebted to the State of Delaware and to Delaware State University. This University and its community – students, staff, faculty, alumni, trustees – have given us more than we could ever have imagined,\" said Dr. Williams. \nWilliams began his DSU career in 2007 with an appointment as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. He's served as the university's president since January 2010. \nDelaware Governor John Carney led a chorus of praise for the departing President, saying, \"Dr. Williams has led Delaware State University during a critical time - when higher education has been more important than ever to the success of young Delawareans, and to our collective success as a state,\" said Governor Carney. \"DSU has long been one of Delaware's most important and historic institutions, and its contributions to our state, our ability to attract talented young people, and prepare the next generation, have only grown under Dr. Williams' guidance. We'll miss his leadership in Delaware. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund is lucky to have him and we wish him well.\" Delaware's entire Congressional Delegation – Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons; and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt-Rochester – joined the well-wishers, lauding Williams for his accomplishments and predicting great things for him at TMCF. \nDSU Board of Trustees Chair Dr. Wilma Mishoe said the university will now look to the future. Our task is to find the next great, transformative leader for DSU. The Executive Committee will meet this week, followed very shortly by the full Board of Trustees, to discuss our path forward through a transition plan and a national search process. Stakeholders from the entire DSU family will be apprised of our progress and involved in our process,\" Mishoe said. Delmarvawide News Delmarvawide News More>>",

      "text": "Tweet Share \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Election Day is just a hair over two weeks away in St. Petersburg, and polls suggest the race between former Mayor Rick Baker and current Mayor Rick Baker is still about as close as it gets . \nAnd though it's ostensibly a nonpartisan affair, party involvement has been big for both candidates — Baker has had financial assistance from many a fellow Republican, while before the primary Kriseman landed an endorsement from none other than Barack Obama (and plenty of other high-profile Dems). \nObservers on both sides see this election as something of a litmus on Trumpism; whether a categorically unpopular president may motivate people to turn out in an election in which they may normally not — or if enough of the city's Democrats will overlook party affiliation and support Baker. \nOn Friday, a Dem that's somewhat high-profile at the national level is coming to town to help drive home Kriseman's Democratic cred. \nJulian Castro, who served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Obama from 2014 through the end of the president's second term, will participate in a roundtable with Kriseman and others at the Station House in downtown St. Petersburg. The public is invited but space is limited and, presuming you go with the suggested donation and don't apply decimals in the quantity field, tickets aren't cheap. \nA former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Castro was on the short list of potential running mates for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Of course, it was Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine who won that honor, ultimately, but the inclusion of his name underscores his status as a rising star in national politics. \nCastro's visit, meanwhile, underscores how close the race is despite St. Petersburg's large Democratic and progressive presence. This may be attributed to Baker's longtime alliances with some key members of St. Petersburg's African American community, which date back to his first administration, a time when party involvement in nonpartisan political races was less of a thing — and there was less outside money funding attack ads that work to steer the narrative in one direction or another (namely, spinning of St. Pete's decades-in-the-making infrastructure woes vs. whether Baker is in line with Donald Trump's agenda, something even the Tampa Bay Times , a key media ally of his, has pointed out ). \nBaker has said repeatedly that party affiliation is not relevant in municipal governance, where playgrounds and potholes see neither red nor blue. Kriseman heartily begs to differ. \nKriseman insists that one belongs to a political party because its values align with his or her own values; that belonging to a party that prioritizes tackling climate change and having a more compassionate approach to immigration or healthcare signals one's character — as does belonging to one that elects someone who jokes or brags about assaulting women solely because said braggart wants to lower taxes, abolish regulations and reduce access to healthcare. \nIt's unclear what kind of a dent Kriseman's Democratic espousal will make in the general election (he unexpectedly bested Baker by 70 votes in the primary). Mail ballots are out and early voting begins this weekend. \nCastro and Kriseman, meanwhile, will be at Station House Friday, Oct. 27 at 10:30 a.m.",

Walker to force a vote on legislation that would raise taxes. The bill would increase the tax burden on working Alaskans by $300 million. \nLast week, AFP-Alaska began a media campaign advocating against any tax increases , especially any tax increase that would target working Alaskans and small business. \n“Working Alaskans and small businesses have made it abundantly clear that new taxes are not the solution to our state’s fiscal woes,” said Jeremy Price, AFP-Alaska State Director . “Implementing this tax is not a serious attempt to address the growing state budget, which can only be solved by cutting government spending. AFP-AK encourages all legislators to be leaders and vote against any new tax increase during this special session.” \nSubmitted by John Rich",

EDT October 23, 2017 Amazon says it plans to hire 30,000 part-time workers in then next year. Getty photo CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nNEW YORK (AP) — Amazon said Monday that it received 238 proposals from cities and regions in the United States, Canada and Mexico hoping to be the home of the company’s second headquarters. \nThe online retailer kicked off its hunt for a second home base in September, promising to bring 50,000 new jobs and spend more than $5 billion on construction. Proposals were due last week, and Amazon made clear that tax breaks and grants would be a big deciding factor on where it chooses to land. \nAmazon.com Inc. did not list which cities or metro areas applied, but said the proposals came from 43 U.S. states, as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, three Mexican states and six Canadian provinces. In a tweet, the company said it was “excited to review each of them.” \nBesides looking for financial incentives, Amazon had stipulated that it was seeking to be near a metropolitan area with more than a million people; be able to attract top technical talent; be within 45 minutes of an international airport; have direct access to mass transit; and be able to expand that headquarters to as much as 8 million square feet in the next decade. \nGenerous tax breaks and other incentives can erode a city’s tax base. For the winner, it could be worth it, since an Amazon headquarters could draw other tech businesses and their well-educated, highly paid employees. \nIn New Jersey, Republican Gov. Chris Christie has endorsed Newark’s bid, saying the state and the city are planning nearly $7 billion in tax breaks. Detroit bid organizers have said its proposal offers Amazon the unique chance to set up shop in both the U.S. and Canada. Missouri officials proposed an innovation corridor between Kansas City and St. Louis rather than a single location. \nThe seven U.S. states that Amazon said did not apply were: Arkansas, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. \nAhead of the deadline, some cities turned to stunts to try and stand out: Representatives from Tucson, Arizona, sent a 21-foot tall cactus to Amazon’s Seattle headquarters; New York lit the Empire State Building orange to match Amazon’s smile logo. \nThe company plans to remain in its sprawling Seattle headquarters, and the second one will be “a full equal” to it, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said in September. Amazon has said that it will announce a decision sometime next year. \n© 2017 Associated Press",

(AP) — A top Republican political consultant and several current and former state representatives are expected in court on charges related to a corruption scheme in South Carolina’s Legislature. \nProsecutor David Pascoe says a bond hearing is scheduled Tuesday afternoon for Richard Quinn on charges of criminal conspiracy and failure to register as a lobbyist. Former Reps. Tracy Edge of North Myrtle Beach and Jim Harrison of Columbia face several charges, including criminal conspiracy and misconduct. \nRep. Rick Quinn, the elder Quinn’s son, was charged with criminal conspiracy. Sen. John Courson of Columbia was charged with statutory misconduct in office. Both men already faced other misconduct charges. \nRichard Quinn is a longtime political consultant who has advised some of South Carolina’s top Republicans.

Asian stocks were mostly higher Monday, with Japan's benchmark rising on the back of an election victory by the prime minister's ruling party, which had promised stability and growth. Shizuo Kambayashi AP Photo Asian stock markets slightly higher after Wall Street loss \nAP Business Writer October 23, 2017 8:49 PM BEIJING \nAsian stock markets edged up Tuesday after Wall Street slid overnight as investors sought new drivers for trading activity. \nKEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.2 percent to 21,733.10 points and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.1 percent to 5,901.10. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 3 points to 3,382.33 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 6 points to 28,309.44. Seoul's Kospi added 2 points to 2,492.28 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur also rose. Singapore and Manila retreated. \nWALL STREET: Industrial and technology companies and retailers all stumbled. General Electric suffered its worst one-day loss in six years following downgrades from analysts. Analysts said markets showed an unusual combination of near-record prices and investor calm. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.4 percent to 2,564.98. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2 percent to 23,273.96. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6 percent to 6,586.83. \nANALYST'S QUOTE: \"It's was all quiet on the Western Front in European and U.S. trade and a pause after what has been such a strong run for global equity and credit markets,\" said Chris Weston of IG in a report. \"Whether the gains can continue this week is obviously yet to be seen, but I remain a bull, but of the view that these markets are tired, fatigued and need new information to fuel the beast.\" \nCHINA POLITICS: China's ruling Communist Party is preparing to appoint President Xi Jinping this week to a second five-year term as leader and unveil a new ruling inner circle around him. After spending his first term cementing his status as China's most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, Xi is widely expected to shift focus to economic policy. In a speech last week, Xi promised to promote entrepreneurial activity but also affirmed party ambitions to build up state-owned companies that dominate banking, energy and other industries. Five of the seven members of the party's Standing Committee are due to retire under informal age limits, clearing the way for Xi to promote allies. \nJAPAN MANUFACTURING: A survey of manufacturers showed activity weakened this month but still grew relatively strongly. The preliminary version of the purchasing managers' index declined to 52.5 from 52.9 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity accelerating. The output component of the survey declined to 52.6 from 53.2 but still showed activity growing. Other components showed export volume rising. \nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 4 cents to $51.94 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 6 cents on Monday to close at $51.90. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 5 cents to $57.42 in London. It fell 38 cents the previous session to $57.37. \nCURRENCY: The dollar declined to 113.35 yen from Monday's 113.43 yen. The euro gained to $1.1764 from $1.1749. Never miss a local story.

Without countries like Italy, it is simply impossible for Europe to boast with firm stability and strong influence all over the world. The Stock Exchange \nFormed by Eugène Beauharnais, Viceroy of Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, in February 1808 to serve as the main stock exchange in Italy, the Borsa Italiana or Italia Borsa or Piazza Affari is one of the first stock exchanges in Europe. Based in Milan, it had been operated by the government until 1998. \nNearly a decade after the privatization of the Borsa Italiana, the London Stock Exchange Group had acquired it in 2007 in an all-stock deal. As a result, it had consolidated with the London Stock Exchange. \nThe pre-market trading on the Borsa Italiana opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 9:00 a.m. It is immediately followed by the regular trading, which opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 5:30 p.m. Lastly, the post-market trading opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 8:30 p.m. Needless to say, Italy is home to one of the world’s longest trading hours. This is in consideration of investors around the world with different time zones, providing them with convenient windows to trade on the Borsa Italiana. \nWith more than 340 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana today, it has an overall market capitalization of nearly $650 billion. Stocks of Cembre SpA are listed inside Borsa Italiana. The Index \nThe FTSE Milano Italia Borsa (MIB) is the benchmark Italian index that tracks the top 40 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana. It had always been known as the S&P/MIB because the S&P oversaw its operation. However, in June 2009, the FTSE had taken over it. \nThe FTSE MIB accounts for about 80% of the overall market capitalization on the Borsa Italiana, which is why it plays an important role in the Italian economy. Its components are classified into various sectors such as Energy, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, among others. \nIn March 2000, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time high of 50,108.56 points. This is also its best intraday high ever. \nWith the sudden increase in borrowing rates in Europe, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time low of 12,362.50 in July 2012. \nInvestors are strongly urged to bet on the growing European economy today; and the best way to do so is to invest on competitive stocks listed on European stock exchanges such as the Borsa Italiana. Investors can pick companies like Cembre SpA right from the market. It goes without saying that investing in Italy will yield valuable returns in the long run. \nCembre SpA is an Italy-based manufacturer of electrical compression connectors and cable accessories for panel building and installation, medium voltage cables and other applications.

      "text": "MG Med Inc (180400) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By marketbeat \nShares of MG Med Inc (KOSDAQ:180400) closed at 16350 yesterday. MG Med Inc currently has a total float of 6.04M shares and on average sees 175,555 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 11550 and high of 22300. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help MG Med Inc to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to MG Med Inc and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. MG Med Inc is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with MG Med Inc hope to find the best quality there. \nMore notable recent MG Med Inc (KOSDAQ:180400) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “FDA tentatively approves Mylan’s HIV med TLE400” on March 20, 2017, also Seekingalpha.com with their article: “Merck’s once-daily HIV med Isentress HD on par with twice-daily formulation” published on July 24, 2017, Prnewswire.com published: “Real-World Evidence Shows Oral INVOKANA® 300 mg Demonstrates Comparable A1C …” on May 05, 2017.

      "text": "Marfrig Global Foods SA (MRFG3) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Marguerite Chambers \nShares of Marfrig Global Foods SA (BVMF:MRFG3) closed at 6.39 yesterday. Marfrig Global Foods SA currently has a total float of 620.51 million shares and on average sees 1.61 million shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 5.08 and high of 7.98. Ibovespa: A Witness to Brazilian Economy’s Success \nUnknown to the knowledge of many, Brazil is one of today’s fastest-growing economies and the reason behind it is a successfully emerging trade and commerce industry. Needless to say, it is a true pride of the South American economy. Brazil gives chances to a lot of big companies as Marfrig Global Foods SA to receive new clients. Brazilian Mercantile and Futures (BM&F) Bovespa \nThe BM&F Bovespa is the main stock exchange in Brazil. Founded on August 23, 1890 as a public entity, it had long been under the strict supervision of the government. By the late 1960s, the government had loosened its grip on the BM&F Bovespa. \nIn 1972, electronic trading had finally been implemented to make things easier for brokers and investors alike. By the end of the decade, the Sistema Privado de Operacões por Telefone (SPOT) or the Private System of Telephone Trading, a telephone trading system, had been introduced. \nThe Mega Bolsa, an electronic trading system, had replaced the old one in 1997. Two years later, the Home Broker, an internet-based trading system that enabled individual investors to trade from home online, had been launched. \nThe BM&F Bovespa had finally been privatized as a profit entity in 2007. It officially became the BM&F Bovespa when the BM&F Exchange and the Bovespa had merged on May 8, 2008 to create a bigger and consolidated stock exchange in Brazil. Marfrig Global Foods SA became one of the active participants of the trading system. \nOn August 17, 2011, the BM&F Bovespa had recorded its largest daily trading volume of $14.80 billion. On June 18, 2012, it had become one of the founding members of the Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative of the United Nations (UN). As of December 2015, more than 450 companies are listed on the BM&F Bovespa. Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index \nThe Ibovespa is the benchmark index in Brazil that weighs the top 50 companies listed on the BM&F Bovespa as a market-capitalization-weighted index. \nConsequently, it represents roughly 70% of the total market capitalization on the BM&F Bovespa. Founded in 1968, it is also the oldest index measuring BM&F Bovespa companies. \nRebalancing of the Ibovespa happens quarterly to ensure its efficient representation of the trade and commerce environment in Brazil. In order for a company to become eligible for inclusion as an Ibovespa component, it must have been listed and traded on the BM&F Bovespa for not less than a calendar year prior to a particular rebalancing period. Also, more than 80% of its shares must be traded on the BM&F Bovespa to guarantee compelling activity. \nThe Ibovespa uses a base value of 100 points, which has a base date of January 2, 1968. \nThe Ibovespa had hit its all-time low of 0 in January 1972. On May 20, 2008, it had hit its all-time high of 73,516 points, which was primarily driven by a positive inflation outlook that caused major industries to surge. Nine days later, the Ibovespa had an intraday high of 73,920 points. \nInvestors must take advantage of the growth of the South American economy by investing on BM&F Bovespa stocks, especially if they are looking for meaningful long-term returns. Investors turn their attention to the Marfrig Global Foods SA equities. \nMore notable recent Marfrig Global Foods SA (BVMF:MRFG3) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “Marfrig Global Foods’ (MRRTY) CEO Frank Ravndal on Q1 2017 Results – Earnings …” on May 12, 2017, also Seekingalpha.com with their article: “Marfrig Global Foods’ (MRRTY) CEO Martin Secco Arias on Q2 2017 Results …” published on August 16, 2017, Seekingalpha.com published: “Marfrig Global Foods’ (MRRTY) CEO Martin Secco on Q4 2016 Results – Earnings …” on February 25, 2017.

The company has market cap of $3.97 billion. The Company’s activities are divided into two operating divisions: Marfrig Beef and Keystone. It currently has negative earnings.

      "text": "Humedix Co Ltd (200670) Declines -0.3% on Oct 24 \nOctober 24, 2017 - By Linda Rogers \nShares of Humedix Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:200670) last traded at 33700, representing a move of -0.3%, or -100 per share, on volume of 3,695 shares. After opening the trading day at 33600, shares of Humedix Co Ltd traded in a close range. Humedix Co Ltd currently has a total float of 8.61 million shares and on average sees 85,961 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 27000 and high of 38950. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help Humedix Co Ltd to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to Humedix Co Ltd and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. Humedix Co Ltd is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with Humedix Co Ltd hope to find the best quality there. \nMore notable recent Humedix Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:200670) news were published by: Reuters.com which released: “Humedix says change of CEO to Jung Gu Wan” on March 17, 2017, also Reuters.com with their article: “Humedix receives patent” published on January 26, 2017, Reuters.com published: “Humedix says annual dividend for 2016” on December 19, 2016.

      "text": "Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd (187270) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By marketbeat \nShares of Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:187270) closed at 5290 yesterday. Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd currently has a total float of 9.95M shares and on average sees 95,158 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 5000 and high of 9531.64. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd hope to find the best quality there. \nMore news for Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:187270) were recently published by: Reuters.com, which released: “Shin Hwa Contech raises 9.75 bln won via rights issue” on June 29, 2017. Reuters.com‘s article titled: “Shin Hwa Contech receives patent” and published on February 23, 2017 is yet another important article. \nShin Hwa Contech Co., Ltd. is a Korea firm engaged in the manufacture of electronic connectors. The company has market cap of $52.63 billion.

      "text": "William Hill plc (WMH) Declines -0.6% on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Vivian Park \nShares of William Hill plc (LON:WMH) last traded at 248, representing a move of -0.6%, or -1.5 per share, on volume of 2.34 million shares. After opening the trading day at 249.1, shares of William Hill plc traded in a close range. William Hill plc currently has a total float of 857.97 million shares and on average sees 2.56M shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 239.1 and high of 312.8. The Evolution Of The LSE In 200 Years \nTrade and commerce in the UK can be traced back to hundreds of years ago. Today, it plays an important role in global trade and commerce as one of the biggest and most significant contributors. \nIt is undeniable that the UK is one of the most developed countries in the world as well. Because of this and its constant strive for progress, the global economy is continuously shaping up to become bigger and better through the years. London Stock Exchange (LSE) \nThe LSE is the main stock exchange in the UK. It had been founded in 1801, making it one of the oldest stock exchanges in the world. \nToday, the LSE is considered as the biggest stock exchange in Europe and the third biggest one in the world. As of the end of the third quarter, more than 2,290 companies are listed on the LSE, bringing its total market capitalization to more than ‘6 trillion. \nPresently, the LSE Group (LSEG), which had been founded in October 2007 following the merger of the LSE and the Borsa Italiana, operates the LSE. Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index \nThe FTSE 100 is the benchmark blue-chip index in the UK. It measures the top 100 companies listed on the LSE as a free-float, market-capitalization-weighted index. As of September, the FTSE 100 has a total market capitalization of ‘1.70 trillion. \nThe FTSE 100 had been founded on January 3, 1984 with a base value of 1,000 points. It is currently operated by the FTSE Group, a subsidiary of LSEG. William Hill plc is a stock traded on the U.K’s stock exchange. \nMost of the components of the FTSE 100 are international companies, which is why it is not a strong indicator of the UK economy. Nonetheless, it is a strong indicator of the LSE, representing more than 80% of the total market capitalization on the LSE. The FTSE 250, which measures the top 250 companies listed on the LSE, is a stronger indicator of the UK economy than the FTSE 100 because of its broad nature and most of its components being domestic companies. William Hill plc has relatively good liquidity. \nThe FTSE 100 is rebalanced quarterly’ specifically every Wednesday immediately following the first Friday of March, June, September, and December. Components that have fallen short of the inclusion requirements are dropped to give way to those that have met all the said requirements. \nThe FTSE 100 had reached its all-time low of 427.50 points in February 1978; and its all-time high of 7,103.98 points in April 2015. Meanwhile, its best intraday high of 7,129 points had been reached on October 11. \nMany investors are banking on the promising growth of the European economy. Amid the pressing concerns of today, it is still ideal for investors to penetrate European equity markets such as that of the UK. \nBoasting with full potentials to realize its growth prospects, the UK economy guarantees meaningful investment returns for domestic and international investors alike. Those who still doubt this can simply look back through the hundreds of years that the UK economy had been tried and tested. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect William Hill plc. \nMore notable recent William Hill plc (LON:WMH) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “William Hill Offers Strong Dividends To Willing Investors” on October 03, 2017, also Seekingalpha.com with their article: “William Hill: Showing Value But Regulatory Risks Remain” published on February 02, 2017, Ft.com published: “William Hill continues search for chief executive” on February 24, 2017.

      "text": "Edan Instruments Inc (300206) Decline -0.1% on Oct 24 \nOctober 24, 2017 - By Louis Casey \nShares of Edan Instruments Inc (SHE:300206) last traded at 9.69, representing a move of -0.1%, or -0.01 per share, on volume of 6,500 shares. After opening the trading day at 9.69, shares of Edan Instruments Inc traded in a close range. Edan Instruments Inc currently has a total float of shares and on average sees shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 7.92 and high of 11.3. What Shapes Asia’s Largest Economy \nThe Asian economy is rapidly growing today and as the second biggest economy globally, China plays a big part in it. In line with this, it is important to know as well what shapes Asia’s largest country in terms of economy into a massive success. Economy rise help some companies including Edan Instruments Inc to try themselves on the big market arena. Building from the Ground Up \nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), operated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is one of China’s primary stock exchanges along with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In Asia, it is the second largest stock exchange. Globally, the SSE is the fifth biggest stock exchange in terms of market capitalization. Companies like Edan Instruments Inc with strong potential and good liquidity are on demand. \nThe SSE had already been founded in the 1860s. However, eventually, it had to close down in 1941 when Japan occupied Shanghai. It was reopened on November 26, 1990 and operations officially started on December 19, 1990. \nCompanies listed on the SSE are classified into two categories: 1) A shares and B shares. The main difference between the two categories is in terms of currency. A shares are traded in yuan while B shares are traded in US dollar (USD). \nBefore, only Chinese citizens were allowed to trade A shares. However, the limitation was lifted in 2002, enabling domestic and international investors to trade both A shares and B shares. With expanded opportunities for traders, the Chinese economy had since then grown faster than ever. Edan Instruments Inc had to quickly adjust. \nPre-market trading on the SSE starts at 9:15 a.m. and ends at 9:25 a.m. Regular trading starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 3:00 p.m. with a two-hour break that starts at 11:31 a.m. and ends at 1:29 p.m. The SSE Composite Index \nThe SSE Composite Index is the benchmark index that tracks all companies listed on the SSE. Because of its broad scope, it is composed of three sub-indices: 1) the SSE 380; 2) the SSE 180; and 3) the SSE 50. These sub-indices are intended to provide more reliable representations of the Chinese equity market given the broad nature of the SSE. \nThe SSE 380 monitors the top 380 stocks on the SSE; the SSE 180 monitors the top 180 stocks; and the SSE 50 monitors the top 50 stocks. In order for stocks to be included in the SSE 50, they first have to be included in the SSE 180; and in order for them to be included in the SSE 180, they first have to be included in the SSE 380. \nThe SSE Composite Index has a base date of December 19, 1990 and a base value of 100. Its all-time high of 6,092.06 had been recorded in October 2007 while its all-time low of 99.98 had been recorded in December 1990. \nToday is the perfect time to penetrate the Chinese equity market. There is no better way to take advantage an immense economic growth than to invest in Asia’s largest economy. With promising growth opportunities and countless potential, investors will surely enjoy the many benefits of investing on the SSE. They are curious about Edan Instruments Inc reliability. \nMore notable recent Edan Instruments Inc (SHE:300206) news were published by: Businesswire.com which released: “BIT Group Establishes IVD-Focused Contract Manufacturing Facility in China” on October 29, 2015, also Marketwired.com with their article: “Edan Introduces Acclarix LX8 Ultrasound System at MEDICA 2014 to Expand …” published on November 12, 2014, Marketwired.com published: “Edan Introduces Acclarix Compact Ultrasound System at ANESTHESIOLOGYâ„¢ 2014” on October 10, 2014.

After opening the trading day at 0.09, shares of EEMS Italia SpA traded in a close range.

What Makes Up the Italian Economy \nItaly is prominent worldwide for a lot of things, especially for its tourism industry. What most people don’t know is that Italy is also home to one of the world’s most successful economies backed by a rich history worth learning about and betting on. The history of EEMS Italia SpA is deeply connected with this market. \nIt is not unknown to many that the European economy is one of the fastest-growing economies worldwide— thanks to its healthy trade and commerce environment brought about by the individual and collective successes of its nations such as Italy. Without countries like Italy, it is simply impossible for Europe to boast with firm stability and strong influence all over the world. The Stock Exchange \nFormed by Eugène Beauharnais, Viceroy of Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, in February 1808 to serve as the main stock exchange in Italy, the Borsa Italiana or Italia Borsa or Piazza Affari is one of the first stock exchanges in Europe. Based in Milan, it had been operated by the government until 1998. \nNearly a decade after the privatization of the Borsa Italiana, the London Stock Exchange Group had acquired it in 2007 in an all-stock deal. As a result, it had consolidated with the London Stock Exchange. \nThe pre-market trading on the Borsa Italiana opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 9:00 a.m. It is immediately followed by the regular trading, which opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 5:30 p.m. Lastly, the post-market trading opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 8:30 p.m. Needless to say, Italy is home to one of the world’s longest trading hours. This is in consideration of investors around the world with different time zones, providing them with convenient windows to trade on the Borsa Italiana. \nWith more than 340 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana today, it has an overall market capitalization of nearly $650 billion. Stocks of EEMS Italia SpA are listed inside Borsa Italiana. The Index \nThe FTSE Milano Italia Borsa (MIB) is the benchmark Italian index that tracks the top 40 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana. It had always been known as the S&P/MIB because the S&P oversaw its operation. However, in June 2009, the FTSE had taken over it. \nThe FTSE MIB accounts for about 80% of the overall market capitalization on the Borsa Italiana, which is why it plays an important role in the Italian economy. Its components are classified into various sectors such as Energy, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, among others. \nIn March 2000, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time high of 50,108.56 points. This is also its best intraday high ever. \nWith the sudden increase in borrowing rates in Europe, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time low of 12,362.50 in July 2012. \nInvestors are strongly urged to bet on the growing European economy today; and the best way to do so is to invest on competitive stocks listed on European stock exchanges such as the Borsa Italiana. Investors can pick companies like EEMS Italia SpA right from the market. It goes without saying that investing in Italy will yield valuable returns in the long run. \nEEMS Italia SpA, formerly EEMS Italia SpA, is an Italy firm engaged in the semiconductors market. The company has market cap of 4.09 million EUR. The Firm divides its activities into three main areas: EEMS Italy, EEMS Asia and Photovoltaic. It currently has negative earnings. Through the Photovoltaic area, the Company is involved in the manufacture of cells and photovoltaic modules, as well as in the development of solutions for the design and construction of solar energy plants.

Euronext Paris Then And Now \nThe European region is home to the best and most competitive stock exchanges in the world; and the Euronext is one of them. However, the Euronext has a far more interesting component backed by a rich history even before the foundation of the pan-European stock exchange— Euronext Paris. LYXOR MSCI EM PEA had to work hard to be the part of Euronext. Euronext Paris Then \nEuronext Paris was first known as the Paris Bourse. The foundation of the Euronext on September 22, 2000, which emerged from the union of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Brussels Stock Exchange, and Parks Bourse, gave birth to its identity today. The main objective of the creation of the first pan-European stock exchange is to take advantage of the resources of the European Union (EU) in a broader and unified attempt to drive long-term economic growth.

Euronext Paris Now \nSince the establishment of the Euronext, Euronext Paris has already gone a long way.

Ibovespa: A Witness to Brazilian Economy’s Success \nUnknown to the knowledge of many, Brazil is one of today’s fastest-growing economies and the reason behind it is a successfully emerging trade and commerce industry. Needless to say, it is a true pride of the South American economy. Brazil gives chances to a lot of big companies as Investimentos Bemge SA to receive new clients. Brazilian Mercantile and Futures (BM&F) Bovespa \nThe BM&F Bovespa is the main stock exchange in Brazil. Founded on August 23, 1890 as a public entity, it had long been under the strict supervision of the government. By the late 1960s, the government had loosened its grip on the BM&F Bovespa. \nIn 1972, electronic trading had finally been implemented to make things easier for brokers and investors alike. By the end of the decade, the Sistema Privado de Operacões por Telefone (SPOT) or the Private System of Telephone Trading, a telephone trading system, had been introduced. \nThe Mega Bolsa, an electronic trading system, had replaced the old one in 1997. Two years later, the Home Broker, an internet-based trading system that enabled individual investors to trade from home online, had been launched. \nThe BM&F Bovespa had finally been privatized as a profit entity in 2007. It officially became the BM&F Bovespa when the BM&F Exchange and the Bovespa had merged on May 8, 2008 to create a bigger and consolidated stock exchange in Brazil. Investimentos Bemge SA became one of the active participants of the trading system. \nOn August 17, 2011, the BM&F Bovespa had recorded its largest daily trading volume of $14.80 billion. On June 18, 2012, it had become one of the founding members of the Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative of the United Nations (UN). As of December 2015, more than 450 companies are listed on the BM&F Bovespa. Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index \nThe Ibovespa is the benchmark index in Brazil that weighs the top 50 companies listed on the BM&F Bovespa as a market-capitalization-weighted index. \nConsequently, it represents roughly 70% of the total market capitalization on the BM&F Bovespa. Founded in 1968, it is also the oldest index measuring BM&F Bovespa companies. \nRebalancing of the Ibovespa happens quarterly to ensure its efficient representation of the trade and commerce environment in Brazil. In order for a company to become eligible for inclusion as an Ibovespa component, it must have been listed and traded on the BM&F Bovespa for not less than a calendar year prior to a particular rebalancing period. Also, more than 80% of its shares must be traded on the BM&F Bovespa to guarantee compelling activity. \nThe Ibovespa uses a base value of 100 points, which has a base date of January 2, 1968. \nThe Ibovespa had hit its all-time low of 0 in January 1972. On May 20, 2008, it had hit its all-time high of 73,516 points, which was primarily driven by a positive inflation outlook that caused major industries to surge. Nine days later, the Ibovespa had an intraday high of 73,920 points. \nInvestors must take advantage of the growth of the South American economy by investing on BM&F Bovespa stocks, especially if they are looking for meaningful long-term returns. Investors turn their attention to the Investimentos Bemge SA equities. \nInvestimentos Bemge SA, formerly Financeira Bemge SA Credito Financiamento e Investimento, is a Brazil firm engaged in the financial sector. The company has market cap of $93.14 million. The Firm is involved in the investment portfolio management, as well as in the provision of administration and consulting services to companies in which it holds shares. It has a 5.98 P/E ratio.

      "text": "Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd (WKOF) Declines -0.86% on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By marketbeat \nShares of Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd (LON:WKOF) last traded at 173.5, representing a move of -0.86%, or -1.5 per share, on volume of 933 shares. After opening the trading day at 176.96, shares of Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd traded in a close range. Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd currently has a total float of 85.86 million shares and on average sees 59,788 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 133 and high of 183. The Evolution Of The LSE In 200 Years \nTrade and commerce in the UK can be traced back to hundreds of years ago. Today, it plays an important role in global trade and commerce as one of the biggest and most significant contributors. \nIt is undeniable that the UK is one of the most developed countries in the world as well. Because of this and its constant strive for progress, the global economy is continuously shaping up to become bigger and better through the years. London Stock Exchange (LSE) \nThe LSE is the main stock exchange in the UK. It had been founded in 1801, making it one of the oldest stock exchanges in the world. \nToday, the LSE is considered as the biggest stock exchange in Europe and the third biggest one in the world. As of the end of the third quarter, more than 2,290 companies are listed on the LSE, bringing its total market capitalization to more than ‘6 trillion. \nPresently, the LSE Group (LSEG), which had been founded in October 2007 following the merger of the LSE and the Borsa Italiana, operates the LSE. Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index \nThe FTSE 100 is the benchmark blue-chip index in the UK. It measures the top 100 companies listed on the LSE as a free-float, market-capitalization-weighted index. As of September, the FTSE 100 has a total market capitalization of ‘1.70 trillion. \nThe FTSE 100 had been founded on January 3, 1984 with a base value of 1,000 points. It is currently operated by the FTSE Group, a subsidiary of LSEG. Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd is a stock traded on the U.K’s stock exchange. \nMost of the components of the FTSE 100 are international companies, which is why it is not a strong indicator of the UK economy. Nonetheless, it is a strong indicator of the LSE, representing more than 80% of the total market capitalization on the LSE. The FTSE 250, which measures the top 250 companies listed on the LSE, is a stronger indicator of the UK economy than the FTSE 100 because of its broad nature and most of its components being domestic companies. Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd has relatively good liquidity. \nThe FTSE 100 is rebalanced quarterly’ specifically every Wednesday immediately following the first Friday of March, June, September, and December. Components that have fallen short of the inclusion requirements are dropped to give way to those that have met all the said requirements. \nThe FTSE 100 had reached its all-time low of 427.50 points in February 1978; and its all-time high of 7,103.98 points in April 2015. Meanwhile, its best intraday high of 7,129 points had been reached on October 11. \nMany investors are banking on the promising growth of the European economy. Amid the pressing concerns of today, it is still ideal for investors to penetrate European equity markets such as that of the UK. \nBoasting with full potentials to realize its growth prospects, the UK economy guarantees meaningful investment returns for domestic and international investors alike. Those who still doubt this can simply look back through the hundreds of years that the UK economy had been tried and tested. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd. \nMore recent Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd (LON:WKOF) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “South Korea: Home Of The World’s Best Equity Opportunities” on May 05, 2015. Also Ft.com published the news titled: “Korea’s chaebols are looking cheap” on May 30, 2013. Gurufocus.com‘s news article titled: “Lotte Confectionery Has Been Growing With Sales” with publication date: March 03, 2017 was also an interesting one. \nWeiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd. is a closed-ended investment company. The company has market cap of 149.83 million GBP. The Company’s investment objective is to provide Shareholders with an attractive return on their investment, predominantly through long-term capital appreciation. It has a 4.35 P/E ratio.

      "text": "Kwangju Bank Co Ltd (192530) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Michael Collier \nShares of Kwangju Bank Co Ltd (KRX:192530) closed at 11950 yesterday. Kwangju Bank Co Ltd currently has a total float of 51.29 million shares and on average sees 58,932 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 9480 and high of 14250. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help Kwangju Bank Co Ltd to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to Kwangju Bank Co Ltd and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. Kwangju Bank Co Ltd is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with Kwangju Bank Co Ltd hope to find the best quality there. \nMore news for Kwangju Bank Co Ltd (KRX:192530) were recently published by: Moodys.com, which released: “Moody’s revises outlook of five Korean banks to negative; downgrades Woori Bank” on April 14, 2016. Moodys.com‘s article titled: “Moody’s: Korean bank and liquidity profiles stable on continued monetary easing” and published on September 06, 2016 is yet another important article. \nKwangju Bank, formerly KJB Financial Group Co., Ltd, is a holding firm engaged in the management of subsidiaries. The company has market cap of $613.23 billion.

      "text": "Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA (NETC4) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Stephen Andrade \nShares of Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA (BVMF:NETC4) closed at 0 yesterday. Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA currently has a total float of 249.66M shares and on average sees 100 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 18.98 and high of 63.85. Ibovespa: A Witness to Brazilian Economy’s Success \nUnknown to the knowledge of many, Brazil is one of today’s fastest-growing economies and the reason behind it is a successfully emerging trade and commerce industry. Needless to say, it is a true pride of the South American economy. Brazil gives chances to a lot of big companies as Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA to receive new clients. Brazilian Mercantile and Futures (BM&F) Bovespa \nThe BM&F Bovespa is the main stock exchange in Brazil. Founded on August 23, 1890 as a public entity, it had long been under the strict supervision of the government. By the late 1960s, the government had loosened its grip on the BM&F Bovespa. \nIn 1972, electronic trading had finally been implemented to make things easier for brokers and investors alike. By the end of the decade, the Sistema Privado de Operacões por Telefone (SPOT) or the Private System of Telephone Trading, a telephone trading system, had been introduced. \nThe Mega Bolsa, an electronic trading system, had replaced the old one in 1997. Two years later, the Home Broker, an internet-based trading system that enabled individual investors to trade from home online, had been launched. \nThe BM&F Bovespa had finally been privatized as a profit entity in 2007. It officially became the BM&F Bovespa when the BM&F Exchange and the Bovespa had merged on May 8, 2008 to create a bigger and consolidated stock exchange in Brazil. Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA became one of the active participants of the trading system. \nOn August 17, 2011, the BM&F Bovespa had recorded its largest daily trading volume of $14.80 billion. On June 18, 2012, it had become one of the founding members of the Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative of the United Nations (UN). As of December 2015, more than 450 companies are listed on the BM&F Bovespa. Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index \nThe Ibovespa is the benchmark index in Brazil that weighs the top 50 companies listed on the BM&F Bovespa as a market-capitalization-weighted index. \nConsequently, it represents roughly 70% of the total market capitalization on the BM&F Bovespa. Founded in 1968, it is also the oldest index measuring BM&F Bovespa companies. \nRebalancing of the Ibovespa happens quarterly to ensure its efficient representation of the trade and commerce environment in Brazil. In order for a company to become eligible for inclusion as an Ibovespa component, it must have been listed and traded on the BM&F Bovespa for not less than a calendar year prior to a particular rebalancing period. Also, more than 80% of its shares must be traded on the BM&F Bovespa to guarantee compelling activity. \nThe Ibovespa uses a base value of 100 points, which has a base date of January 2, 1968. \nThe Ibovespa had hit its all-time low of 0 in January 1972. On May 20, 2008, it had hit its all-time high of 73,516 points, which was primarily driven by a positive inflation outlook that caused major industries to surge. Nine days later, the Ibovespa had an intraday high of 73,920 points. \nInvestors must take advantage of the growth of the South American economy by investing on BM&F Bovespa stocks, especially if they are looking for meaningful long-term returns. Investors turn their attention to the Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA equities. \nMore recent Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA (BVMF:NETC4) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “Net Servicos: 4.2% Gross Return In Three Weeks With Very Low Downside Risk” on November 21, 2013. Also Theglobeandmail.com published the news titled: “Cash in on Olympics 2016 with these Brazilian stocks” on August 14, 2012. Prnewswire.com‘s news article titled: “NII Holdings Announces New President of Nextel Brazil and Appointment of Board …” with publication date: August 24, 2015 was also an interesting one. \nNet Servicos de Comunicacao SA is a Brazil firm that controls a group of cable subscription television companies. The company has market cap of $. The Firm offers cable television services under NET brand name and Internet access under NET VIRTUA brand name through several cable networks located in the country’s largest cities.

      "text": "Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. (3331) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 24, 2017 - By Michael Collier \nShares of Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. (TYO:3331) closed at 236 yesterday. Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. currently has a total float of 10.26 million shares and on average sees shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 28 and high of 550. TSE: Lifting Japan Since 1878 \nJapan is one of the best countries in the world. It is home to the best innovations and a compelling economy as well. Of course, such is the case because of the nation’s rich equity market. How It Came to Be \nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) was established in 1878, being one of the first stock exchanges in Asia. When the World War II (WWII) broke out, the TSE has consolidated with five other stock exchanges in Japan in 1943, forming a broader TSE. Two years later, the TSE had to close amid the repercussions of the WWII. Nonetheless, in 1949, it was relaunched to build the Japanese economy from the ground up. Japan has never moved backwards since then. \nThe Nihon Keizai Shimbun or Nikkei 225 or Nikkei Stock Average, which opened on September 7, 1950, is the benchmark index monitoring the 225 best-performing stocks on the TSE. Unlike most indices that are measured based on market capitalization, the Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted index. It tracks the most active stocks on the TSE using the base value of 176.21 and the base date of May 1949, the time when the TSE reopened. \nThe components of the Nikkei 225 are reviewed annually, particularly every September. Any changes made during the annual review are to reflect in the following month. \nIn the 1980s, the Nikkei 225 had its most glorious decade. As the government strived to recover in the post-war period, it had used monetary stimuli to drive the economy. Stock prices had tripled in the latter part of the decade. That time, the TSE had made up 60% of the total market capitalization in the world. \nOn December 29, 1989, the Nikkei 225 had recorded its all-time high of 38,957.44. Upon reaching its peak, however, the TSE had fallen roughly 33% come 1990. \nThe Nikkei 225 Futures was first introduced on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 1986; on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) in 1988; and on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1990. Japanese Equity Market Today \nWhen the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 broke out; the Japanese equity market is one of those that had taken a great hit. In October 2008, the Nikkei 225 had sunk below the 7,000 mark, down by about 80% from its all-time high. Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. is a stock traded on the Japan stock exchange. \nNonetheless, the Nikkei 225 was still able to recover. Last year, it had reached a 20,000 mark after Japan was able to recoup from the 2011 earthquake. \nLike the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the US, the Nikkei 225 is today’s commonly quoted index in Japan. Weighing 225 blue-chip companies, it is the leading indicators of the present state of the Japanese economy as well as near-term and long-term forecasts. Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. has relatively good liquidity. \nThe Nikkei 225 is also one of the fastest indices in Asia, boasting with a speed of 15 seconds since January 2010. \nJapan is already one of the world’s economy giants and it still continues to grow. This is why investors are making long-term investments in TSE stocks as they bet on the Japanese economy. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd.. \nAnother recent and important Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. (TYO:3331) news was published by Reuters.com which published an article titled: “Zakkaya Bulldog updates merger with merge with Tokushima-based company” on October 15, 2015. \nZakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. is a company engaged in the operation of chain-stores that sell miscellaneous goods. The company has market cap of $2.42 billion. The Firm operates retail stores under the names Bulldog and Thanade. It currently has negative earnings. The Company’s Bulldog stores offer fashion miscellaneous goods including accessories, costumes, party goods and battery toys, among others.

What Shapes Asia’s Largest Economy \nThe Asian economy is rapidly growing today and as the second biggest economy globally, China plays a big part in it. In line with this, it is important to know as well what shapes Asia’s largest country in terms of economy into a massive success. Economy rise help some companies including BEIJING THUNISOFT CORP LTD to try themselves on the big market arena. Building from the Ground Up \nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), operated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is one of China’s primary stock exchanges along with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In Asia, it is the second largest stock exchange. Globally, the SSE is the fifth biggest stock exchange in terms of market capitalization. Companies like BEIJING THUNISOFT CORP LTD with strong potential and good liquidity are on demand. \nThe SSE had already been founded in the 1860s. However, eventually, it had to close down in 1941 when Japan occupied Shanghai. It was reopened on November 26, 1990 and operations officially started on December 19, 1990. \nCompanies listed on the SSE are classified into two categories: 1) A shares and B shares. The main difference between the two categories is in terms of currency. A shares are traded in yuan while B shares are traded in US dollar (USD). \nBefore, only Chinese citizens were allowed to trade A shares. However, the limitation was lifted in 2002, enabling domestic and international investors to trade both A shares and B shares. With expanded opportunities for traders, the Chinese economy had since then grown faster than ever. BEIJING THUNISOFT CORP LTD had to quickly adjust. \nPre-market trading on the SSE starts at 9:15 a.m. and ends at 9:25 a.m. Regular trading starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 3:00 p.m. with a two-hour break that starts at 11:31 a.m. and ends at 1:29 p.m. The SSE Composite Index \nThe SSE Composite Index is the benchmark index that tracks all companies listed on the SSE. Because of its broad scope, it is composed of three sub-indices: 1) the SSE 380; 2) the SSE 180; and 3) the SSE 50. These sub-indices are intended to provide more reliable representations of the Chinese equity market given the broad nature of the SSE. \nThe SSE 380 monitors the top 380 stocks on the SSE; the SSE 180 monitors the top 180 stocks; and the SSE 50 monitors the top 50 stocks. In order for stocks to be included in the SSE 50, they first have to be included in the SSE 180; and in order for them to be included in the SSE 180, they first have to be included in the SSE 380. \nThe SSE Composite Index has a base date of December 19, 1990 and a base value of 100. Its all-time high of 6,092.06 had been recorded in October 2007 while its all-time low of 99.98 had been recorded in December 1990. \nToday is the perfect time to penetrate the Chinese equity market. There is no better way to take advantage an immense economic growth than to invest in Asia’s largest economy. With promising growth opportunities and countless potential, investors will surely enjoy the many benefits of investing on the SSE.

Asian stocks were mostly higher Monday, with Japan's benchmark rising on the back of an election victory by the prime minister's ruling party, which had promised stability and growth. Shizuo Kambayashi AP Photo Asian stock markets slightly higher after Wall Street loss \nAP Business Writer October 23, 2017 8:49 PM BEIJING \nAsian stock markets edged up Tuesday after Wall Street slid overnight as investors sought new drivers for trading activity. \nKEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.2 percent to 21,733.10 points and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.1 percent to 5,901.10. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 3 points to 3,382.33 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 6 points to 28,309.44. Seoul's Kospi added 2 points to 2,492.28 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur also rose. Singapore and Manila retreated. \nWALL STREET: Industrial and technology companies and retailers all stumbled. General Electric suffered its worst one-day loss in six years following downgrades from analysts. Analysts said markets showed an unusual combination of near-record prices and investor calm. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.4 percent to 2,564.98. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2 percent to 23,273.96. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6 percent to 6,586.83. \nANALYST'S QUOTE: \"It's was all quiet on the Western Front in European and U.S. trade and a pause after what has been such a strong run for global equity and credit markets,\" said Chris Weston of IG in a report. \"Whether the gains can continue this week is obviously yet to be seen, but I remain a bull, but of the view that these markets are tired, fatigued and need new information to fuel the beast.\" \nCHINA POLITICS: China's ruling Communist Party is preparing to appoint President Xi Jinping this week to a second five-year term as leader and unveil a new ruling inner circle around him. After spending his first term cementing his status as China's most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, Xi is widely expected to shift focus to economic policy. In a speech last week, Xi promised to promote entrepreneurial activity but also affirmed party ambitions to build up state-owned companies that dominate banking, energy and other industries. Five of the seven members of the party's Standing Committee are due to retire under informal age limits, clearing the way for Xi to promote allies. \nJAPAN MANUFACTURING: A survey of manufacturers showed activity weakened this month but still grew relatively strongly. The preliminary version of the purchasing managers' index declined to 52.5 from 52.9 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity accelerating. The output component of the survey declined to 52.6 from 53.2 but still showed activity growing. Other components showed export volume rising. \nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 4 cents to $51.94 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 6 cents on Monday to close at $51.90. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 5 cents to $57.42 in London. It fell 38 cents the previous session to $57.37. \nCURRENCY: The dollar declined to 113.35 yen from Monday's 113.43 yen. The euro gained to $1.1764 from $1.1749. Never miss a local story.

      "text": "Cembre SpA (CMB) Decline -1.38% on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Vivian Currie \nShares of Cembre SpA (BIT:CMB) last traded at 23.57, representing a move of -1.38%, or -0.33 per share, on volume of 17,218 shares. After opening the trading day at 23.62, shares of Cembre SpA traded in a close range. Cembre SpA currently has a total float of 16.85 million shares and on average sees 18,800 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 12.27 and high of 25.9. What Makes Up the Italian Economy \nItaly is prominent worldwide for a lot of things, especially for its tourism industry. What most people don’t know is that Italy is also home to one of the world’s most successful economies backed by a rich history worth learning about and betting on. The history of Cembre SpA is deeply connected with this market. \nIt is not unknown to many that the European economy is one of the fastest-growing economies worldwide— thanks to its healthy trade and commerce environment brought about by the individual and collective successes of its nations such as Italy. Without countries like Italy, it is simply impossible for Europe to boast with firm stability and strong influence all over the world. The Stock Exchange \nFormed by Eugène Beauharnais, Viceroy of Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, in February 1808 to serve as the main stock exchange in Italy, the Borsa Italiana or Italia Borsa or Piazza Affari is one of the first stock exchanges in Europe. Based in Milan, it had been operated by the government until 1998. \nNearly a decade after the privatization of the Borsa Italiana, the London Stock Exchange Group had acquired it in 2007 in an all-stock deal. As a result, it had consolidated with the London Stock Exchange. \nThe pre-market trading on the Borsa Italiana opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 9:00 a.m. It is immediately followed by the regular trading, which opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 5:30 p.m. Lastly, the post-market trading opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 8:30 p.m. Needless to say, Italy is home to one of the world’s longest trading hours. This is in consideration of investors around the world with different time zones, providing them with convenient windows to trade on the Borsa Italiana. \nWith more than 340 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana today, it has an overall market capitalization of nearly $650 billion. Stocks of Cembre SpA are listed inside Borsa Italiana. The Index \nThe FTSE Milano Italia Borsa (MIB) is the benchmark Italian index that tracks the top 40 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana. It had always been known as the S&P/MIB because the S&P oversaw its operation. However, in June 2009, the FTSE had taken over it. \nThe FTSE MIB accounts for about 80% of the overall market capitalization on the Borsa Italiana, which is why it plays an important role in the Italian economy. Its components are classified into various sectors such as Energy, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, among others. \nIn March 2000, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time high of 50,108.56 points. This is also its best intraday high ever. \nWith the sudden increase in borrowing rates in Europe, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time low of 12,362.50 in July 2012. \nInvestors are strongly urged to bet on the growing European economy today; and the best way to do so is to invest on competitive stocks listed on European stock exchanges such as the Borsa Italiana. Investors can pick companies like Cembre SpA right from the market. It goes without saying that investing in Italy will yield valuable returns in the long run. \nCembre SpA is an Italy-based manufacturer of electrical compression connectors and cable accessories for panel building and installation, medium voltage cables and other applications. The company has market cap of 400.69 million EUR. The Firm also makes mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic tools for installing electrical connectors and for cutting cables, and terminal blocks.

After opening the trading day at 68.5, shares of DAIMLER traded in a close range. DAIMLER currently has a total float of 1.07 billion shares and on average sees 2,152 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 59.05 and high of 73.1. What Makes Up the Italian Economy \nItaly is prominent worldwide for a lot of things, especially for its tourism industry. What most people don’t know is that Italy is also home to one of the world’s most successful economies backed by a rich history worth learning about and betting on. The history of DAIMLER is deeply connected with this market. \nIt is not unknown to many that the European economy is one of the fastest-growing economies worldwide— thanks to its healthy trade and commerce environment brought about by the individual and collective successes of its nations such as Italy. Without countries like Italy, it is simply impossible for Europe to boast with firm stability and strong influence all over the world.

      "text": "MG Med Inc (180400) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By marketbeat \nShares of MG Med Inc (KOSDAQ:180400) closed at 16350 yesterday. MG Med Inc currently has a total float of 6.04M shares and on average sees 175,555 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 11550 and high of 22300. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help MG Med Inc to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to MG Med Inc and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. MG Med Inc is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with MG Med Inc hope to find the best quality there. \nMore notable recent MG Med Inc (KOSDAQ:180400) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “FDA tentatively approves Mylan’s HIV med TLE400” on March 20, 2017, also Seekingalpha.com with their article: “Merck’s once-daily HIV med Isentress HD on par with twice-daily formulation” published on July 24, 2017, Prnewswire.com published: “Real-World Evidence Shows Oral INVOKANA® 300 mg Demonstrates Comparable A1C …” on May 05, 2017.

      "text": "Marfrig Global Foods SA (MRFG3) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Marguerite Chambers \nShares of Marfrig Global Foods SA (BVMF:MRFG3) closed at 6.39 yesterday. Marfrig Global Foods SA currently has a total float of 620.51 million shares and on average sees 1.61 million shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 5.08 and high of 7.98. Ibovespa: A Witness to Brazilian Economy’s Success \nUnknown to the knowledge of many, Brazil is one of today’s fastest-growing economies and the reason behind it is a successfully emerging trade and commerce industry. Needless to say, it is a true pride of the South American economy. Brazil gives chances to a lot of big companies as Marfrig Global Foods SA to receive new clients. Brazilian Mercantile and Futures (BM&F) Bovespa \nThe BM&F Bovespa is the main stock exchange in Brazil. Founded on August 23, 1890 as a public entity, it had long been under the strict supervision of the government. By the late 1960s, the government had loosened its grip on the BM&F Bovespa. \nIn 1972, electronic trading had finally been implemented to make things easier for brokers and investors alike. By the end of the decade, the Sistema Privado de Operacões por Telefone (SPOT) or the Private System of Telephone Trading, a telephone trading system, had been introduced. \nThe Mega Bolsa, an electronic trading system, had replaced the old one in 1997. Two years later, the Home Broker, an internet-based trading system that enabled individual investors to trade from home online, had been launched. \nThe BM&F Bovespa had finally been privatized as a profit entity in 2007. It officially became the BM&F Bovespa when the BM&F Exchange and the Bovespa had merged on May 8, 2008 to create a bigger and consolidated stock exchange in Brazil. Marfrig Global Foods SA became one of the active participants of the trading system. \nOn August 17, 2011, the BM&F Bovespa had recorded its largest daily trading volume of $14.80 billion. On June 18, 2012, it had become one of the founding members of the Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative of the United Nations (UN). As of December 2015, more than 450 companies are listed on the BM&F Bovespa. Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index \nThe Ibovespa is the benchmark index in Brazil that weighs the top 50 companies listed on the BM&F Bovespa as a market-capitalization-weighted index. \nConsequently, it represents roughly 70% of the total market capitalization on the BM&F Bovespa. Founded in 1968, it is also the oldest index measuring BM&F Bovespa companies. \nRebalancing of the Ibovespa happens quarterly to ensure its efficient representation of the trade and commerce environment in Brazil. In order for a company to become eligible for inclusion as an Ibovespa component, it must have been listed and traded on the BM&F Bovespa for not less than a calendar year prior to a particular rebalancing period. Also, more than 80% of its shares must be traded on the BM&F Bovespa to guarantee compelling activity. \nThe Ibovespa uses a base value of 100 points, which has a base date of January 2, 1968. \nThe Ibovespa had hit its all-time low of 0 in January 1972. On May 20, 2008, it had hit its all-time high of 73,516 points, which was primarily driven by a positive inflation outlook that caused major industries to surge. Nine days later, the Ibovespa had an intraday high of 73,920 points. \nInvestors must take advantage of the growth of the South American economy by investing on BM&F Bovespa stocks, especially if they are looking for meaningful long-term returns. Investors turn their attention to the Marfrig Global Foods SA equities. \nMore notable recent Marfrig Global Foods SA (BVMF:MRFG3) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “Marfrig Global Foods’ (MRRTY) CEO Frank Ravndal on Q1 2017 Results – Earnings …” on May 12, 2017, also Seekingalpha.com with their article: “Marfrig Global Foods’ (MRRTY) CEO Martin Secco Arias on Q2 2017 Results …” published on August 16, 2017, Seekingalpha.com published: “Marfrig Global Foods’ (MRRTY) CEO Martin Secco on Q4 2016 Results – Earnings …” on February 25, 2017.

The company has market cap of $3.97 billion. The Company’s activities are divided into two operating divisions: Marfrig Beef and Keystone. It currently has negative earnings.

      "text": "Humedix Co Ltd (200670) Declines -0.3% on Oct 24 \nOctober 24, 2017 - By Linda Rogers \nShares of Humedix Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:200670) last traded at 33700, representing a move of -0.3%, or -100 per share, on volume of 3,695 shares. After opening the trading day at 33600, shares of Humedix Co Ltd traded in a close range. Humedix Co Ltd currently has a total float of 8.61 million shares and on average sees 85,961 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 27000 and high of 38950. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help Humedix Co Ltd to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to Humedix Co Ltd and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. Humedix Co Ltd is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with Humedix Co Ltd hope to find the best quality there. \nMore notable recent Humedix Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:200670) news were published by: Reuters.com which released: “Humedix says change of CEO to Jung Gu Wan” on March 17, 2017, also Reuters.com with their article: “Humedix receives patent” published on January 26, 2017, Reuters.com published: “Humedix says annual dividend for 2016” on December 19, 2016.

      "text": "Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd (187270) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By marketbeat \nShares of Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:187270) closed at 5290 yesterday. Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd currently has a total float of 9.95M shares and on average sees 95,158 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 5000 and high of 9531.64. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd hope to find the best quality there. \nMore news for Shin Hwa contech Co Ltd (KOSDAQ:187270) were recently published by: Reuters.com, which released: “Shin Hwa Contech raises 9.75 bln won via rights issue” on June 29, 2017. Reuters.com‘s article titled: “Shin Hwa Contech receives patent” and published on February 23, 2017 is yet another important article. \nShin Hwa Contech Co., Ltd. is a Korea firm engaged in the manufacture of electronic connectors. The company has market cap of $52.63 billion.

      "text": "William Hill plc (WMH) Declines -0.6% on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Vivian Park \nShares of William Hill plc (LON:WMH) last traded at 248, representing a move of -0.6%, or -1.5 per share, on volume of 2.34 million shares. After opening the trading day at 249.1, shares of William Hill plc traded in a close range. William Hill plc currently has a total float of 857.97 million shares and on average sees 2.56M shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 239.1 and high of 312.8. The Evolution Of The LSE In 200 Years \nTrade and commerce in the UK can be traced back to hundreds of years ago. Today, it plays an important role in global trade and commerce as one of the biggest and most significant contributors. \nIt is undeniable that the UK is one of the most developed countries in the world as well. Because of this and its constant strive for progress, the global economy is continuously shaping up to become bigger and better through the years. London Stock Exchange (LSE) \nThe LSE is the main stock exchange in the UK. It had been founded in 1801, making it one of the oldest stock exchanges in the world. \nToday, the LSE is considered as the biggest stock exchange in Europe and the third biggest one in the world. As of the end of the third quarter, more than 2,290 companies are listed on the LSE, bringing its total market capitalization to more than ‘6 trillion. \nPresently, the LSE Group (LSEG), which had been founded in October 2007 following the merger of the LSE and the Borsa Italiana, operates the LSE. Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index \nThe FTSE 100 is the benchmark blue-chip index in the UK. It measures the top 100 companies listed on the LSE as a free-float, market-capitalization-weighted index. As of September, the FTSE 100 has a total market capitalization of ‘1.70 trillion. \nThe FTSE 100 had been founded on January 3, 1984 with a base value of 1,000 points. It is currently operated by the FTSE Group, a subsidiary of LSEG. William Hill plc is a stock traded on the U.K’s stock exchange. \nMost of the components of the FTSE 100 are international companies, which is why it is not a strong indicator of the UK economy. Nonetheless, it is a strong indicator of the LSE, representing more than 80% of the total market capitalization on the LSE. The FTSE 250, which measures the top 250 companies listed on the LSE, is a stronger indicator of the UK economy than the FTSE 100 because of its broad nature and most of its components being domestic companies. William Hill plc has relatively good liquidity. \nThe FTSE 100 is rebalanced quarterly’ specifically every Wednesday immediately following the first Friday of March, June, September, and December. Components that have fallen short of the inclusion requirements are dropped to give way to those that have met all the said requirements. \nThe FTSE 100 had reached its all-time low of 427.50 points in February 1978; and its all-time high of 7,103.98 points in April 2015. Meanwhile, its best intraday high of 7,129 points had been reached on October 11. \nMany investors are banking on the promising growth of the European economy. Amid the pressing concerns of today, it is still ideal for investors to penetrate European equity markets such as that of the UK. \nBoasting with full potentials to realize its growth prospects, the UK economy guarantees meaningful investment returns for domestic and international investors alike. Those who still doubt this can simply look back through the hundreds of years that the UK economy had been tried and tested. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect William Hill plc. \nMore notable recent William Hill plc (LON:WMH) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “William Hill Offers Strong Dividends To Willing Investors” on October 03, 2017, also Seekingalpha.com with their article: “William Hill: Showing Value But Regulatory Risks Remain” published on February 02, 2017, Ft.com published: “William Hill continues search for chief executive” on February 24, 2017.

      "text": "Edan Instruments Inc (300206) Decline -0.1% on Oct 24 \nOctober 24, 2017 - By Louis Casey \nShares of Edan Instruments Inc (SHE:300206) last traded at 9.69, representing a move of -0.1%, or -0.01 per share, on volume of 6,500 shares. After opening the trading day at 9.69, shares of Edan Instruments Inc traded in a close range. Edan Instruments Inc currently has a total float of shares and on average sees shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 7.92 and high of 11.3. What Shapes Asia’s Largest Economy \nThe Asian economy is rapidly growing today and as the second biggest economy globally, China plays a big part in it. In line with this, it is important to know as well what shapes Asia’s largest country in terms of economy into a massive success. Economy rise help some companies including Edan Instruments Inc to try themselves on the big market arena. Building from the Ground Up \nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), operated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is one of China’s primary stock exchanges along with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In Asia, it is the second largest stock exchange. Globally, the SSE is the fifth biggest stock exchange in terms of market capitalization. Companies like Edan Instruments Inc with strong potential and good liquidity are on demand. \nThe SSE had already been founded in the 1860s. However, eventually, it had to close down in 1941 when Japan occupied Shanghai. It was reopened on November 26, 1990 and operations officially started on December 19, 1990. \nCompanies listed on the SSE are classified into two categories: 1) A shares and B shares. The main difference between the two categories is in terms of currency. A shares are traded in yuan while B shares are traded in US dollar (USD). \nBefore, only Chinese citizens were allowed to trade A shares. However, the limitation was lifted in 2002, enabling domestic and international investors to trade both A shares and B shares. With expanded opportunities for traders, the Chinese economy had since then grown faster than ever. Edan Instruments Inc had to quickly adjust. \nPre-market trading on the SSE starts at 9:15 a.m. and ends at 9:25 a.m. Regular trading starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 3:00 p.m. with a two-hour break that starts at 11:31 a.m. and ends at 1:29 p.m. The SSE Composite Index \nThe SSE Composite Index is the benchmark index that tracks all companies listed on the SSE. Because of its broad scope, it is composed of three sub-indices: 1) the SSE 380; 2) the SSE 180; and 3) the SSE 50. These sub-indices are intended to provide more reliable representations of the Chinese equity market given the broad nature of the SSE. \nThe SSE 380 monitors the top 380 stocks on the SSE; the SSE 180 monitors the top 180 stocks; and the SSE 50 monitors the top 50 stocks. In order for stocks to be included in the SSE 50, they first have to be included in the SSE 180; and in order for them to be included in the SSE 180, they first have to be included in the SSE 380. \nThe SSE Composite Index has a base date of December 19, 1990 and a base value of 100. Its all-time high of 6,092.06 had been recorded in October 2007 while its all-time low of 99.98 had been recorded in December 1990. \nToday is the perfect time to penetrate the Chinese equity market. There is no better way to take advantage an immense economic growth than to invest in Asia’s largest economy. With promising growth opportunities and countless potential, investors will surely enjoy the many benefits of investing on the SSE.

After opening the trading day at 0.09, shares of EEMS Italia SpA traded in a close range.

What Makes Up the Italian Economy \nItaly is prominent worldwide for a lot of things, especially for its tourism industry. What most people don’t know is that Italy is also home to one of the world’s most successful economies backed by a rich history worth learning about and betting on. The history of EEMS Italia SpA is deeply connected with this market. \nIt is not unknown to many that the European economy is one of the fastest-growing economies worldwide— thanks to its healthy trade and commerce environment brought about by the individual and collective successes of its nations such as Italy. Without countries like Italy, it is simply impossible for Europe to boast with firm stability and strong influence all over the world. The Stock Exchange \nFormed by Eugène Beauharnais, Viceroy of Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, in February 1808 to serve as the main stock exchange in Italy, the Borsa Italiana or Italia Borsa or Piazza Affari is one of the first stock exchanges in Europe. Based in Milan, it had been operated by the government until 1998. \nNearly a decade after the privatization of the Borsa Italiana, the London Stock Exchange Group had acquired it in 2007 in an all-stock deal. As a result, it had consolidated with the London Stock Exchange. \nThe pre-market trading on the Borsa Italiana opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 9:00 a.m. It is immediately followed by the regular trading, which opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 5:30 p.m. Lastly, the post-market trading opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 8:30 p.m. Needless to say, Italy is home to one of the world’s longest trading hours. This is in consideration of investors around the world with different time zones, providing them with convenient windows to trade on the Borsa Italiana. \nWith more than 340 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana today, it has an overall market capitalization of nearly $650 billion. Stocks of EEMS Italia SpA are listed inside Borsa Italiana. The Index \nThe FTSE Milano Italia Borsa (MIB) is the benchmark Italian index that tracks the top 40 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana. It had always been known as the S&P/MIB because the S&P oversaw its operation. However, in June 2009, the FTSE had taken over it. \nThe FTSE MIB accounts for about 80% of the overall market capitalization on the Borsa Italiana, which is why it plays an important role in the Italian economy. Its components are classified into various sectors such as Energy, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, among others. \nIn March 2000, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time high of 50,108.56 points. This is also its best intraday high ever. \nWith the sudden increase in borrowing rates in Europe, the FTSE MIB had reached its all-time low of 12,362.50 in July 2012. \nInvestors are strongly urged to bet on the growing European economy today; and the best way to do so is to invest on competitive stocks listed on European stock exchanges such as the Borsa Italiana. Investors can pick companies like EEMS Italia SpA right from the market. It goes without saying that investing in Italy will yield valuable returns in the long run. \nEEMS Italia SpA, formerly EEMS Italia SpA, is an Italy firm engaged in the semiconductors market. The company has market cap of 4.09 million EUR. The Firm divides its activities into three main areas: EEMS Italy, EEMS Asia and Photovoltaic. It currently has negative earnings. Through the Photovoltaic area, the Company is involved in the manufacture of cells and photovoltaic modules, as well as in the development of solutions for the design and construction of solar energy plants.

Euronext Paris Then And Now \nThe European region is home to the best and most competitive stock exchanges in the world; and the Euronext is one of them. However, the Euronext has a far more interesting component backed by a rich history even before the foundation of the pan-European stock exchange— Euronext Paris. LYXOR MSCI EM PEA had to work hard to be the part of Euronext. Euronext Paris Then \nEuronext Paris was first known as the Paris Bourse. The foundation of the Euronext on September 22, 2000, which emerged from the union of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Brussels Stock Exchange, and Parks Bourse, gave birth to its identity today. The main objective of the creation of the first pan-European stock exchange is to take advantage of the resources of the European Union (EU) in a broader and unified attempt to drive long-term economic growth. Only healthy companies like LYXOR MSCI EM PEA can be allowed at the market. Truly enough, Euronext Paris is living up to its founding mission until today— helping the European economy thrive even at pressing times. \nThe CAC 40, the benchmark index in France monitoring the most significant companies listed on Euronext Paris, is among the most anticipated indices of the Euronext along with PSI 20, Next 150, Euronext 100, BEL 20, AScX, AMX, AEX, among others. It tracks companies with a base value of 1,000 and a base date of December 31, 1987. \nIn January 1988, the CAC had reached its lowest level ever, closing a session at 893.82. Euronext Paris Now \nSince the establishment of the Euronext, Euronext Paris has already gone a long way. As of the earlier part of 2014, the Euronext has a total market valuation of nearly €3 trillion. \nUnlike the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the CAC 40 has been weighing stocks based on free-float market capitalization and share turnover over the previous 12-month period since December 1, 2003. Prior to this, it has been weighing stocks based on overall market valuation. \nAll the factors of LYXOR MSCI EM PEA reliability is carefully checked by specialists. CAC 40 components are reviewed four times annually, particularly on the third Friday of the months of March, June, September, and December. The stocks are capped at 15% if the need calls for it. The Index Steering Committee, which handles the review, ranks the top 100 companies on Euronext Paris.

Ibovespa: A Witness to Brazilian Economy’s Success \nUnknown to the knowledge of many, Brazil is one of today’s fastest-growing economies and the reason behind it is a successfully emerging trade and commerce industry. Needless to say, it is a true pride of the South American economy. Brazil gives chances to a lot of big companies as Investimentos Bemge SA to receive new clients. Brazilian Mercantile and Futures (BM&F) Bovespa \nThe BM&F Bovespa is the main stock exchange in Brazil. Founded on August 23, 1890 as a public entity, it had long been under the strict supervision of the government. By the late 1960s, the government had loosened its grip on the BM&F Bovespa. \nIn 1972, electronic trading had finally been implemented to make things easier for brokers and investors alike. By the end of the decade, the Sistema Privado de Operacões por Telefone (SPOT) or the Private System of Telephone Trading, a telephone trading system, had been introduced. \nThe Mega Bolsa, an electronic trading system, had replaced the old one in 1997. Two years later, the Home Broker, an internet-based trading system that enabled individual investors to trade from home online, had been launched. \nThe BM&F Bovespa had finally been privatized as a profit entity in 2007. It officially became the BM&F Bovespa when the BM&F Exchange and the Bovespa had merged on May 8, 2008 to create a bigger and consolidated stock exchange in Brazil. Investimentos Bemge SA became one of the active participants of the trading system. \nOn August 17, 2011, the BM&F Bovespa had recorded its largest daily trading volume of $14.80 billion. On June 18, 2012, it had become one of the founding members of the Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative of the United Nations (UN). As of December 2015, more than 450 companies are listed on the BM&F Bovespa. Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index \nThe Ibovespa is the benchmark index in Brazil that weighs the top 50 companies listed on the BM&F Bovespa as a market-capitalization-weighted index. \nConsequently, it represents roughly 70% of the total market capitalization on the BM&F Bovespa. Founded in 1968, it is also the oldest index measuring BM&F Bovespa companies. \nRebalancing of the Ibovespa happens quarterly to ensure its efficient representation of the trade and commerce environment in Brazil. In order for a company to become eligible for inclusion as an Ibovespa component, it must have been listed and traded on the BM&F Bovespa for not less than a calendar year prior to a particular rebalancing period. Also, more than 80% of its shares must be traded on the BM&F Bovespa to guarantee compelling activity. \nThe Ibovespa uses a base value of 100 points, which has a base date of January 2, 1968. \nThe Ibovespa had hit its all-time low of 0 in January 1972. On May 20, 2008, it had hit its all-time high of 73,516 points, which was primarily driven by a positive inflation outlook that caused major industries to surge. Nine days later, the Ibovespa had an intraday high of 73,920 points. \nInvestors must take advantage of the growth of the South American economy by investing on BM&F Bovespa stocks, especially if they are looking for meaningful long-term returns. Investors turn their attention to the Investimentos Bemge SA equities. \nInvestimentos Bemge SA, formerly Financeira Bemge SA Credito Financiamento e Investimento, is a Brazil firm engaged in the financial sector. The company has market cap of $93.14 million. The Firm is involved in the investment portfolio management, as well as in the provision of administration and consulting services to companies in which it holds shares. It has a 5.98 P/E ratio.

      "text": "Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd (WKOF) Declines -0.86% on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By marketbeat \nShares of Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd (LON:WKOF) last traded at 173.5, representing a move of -0.86%, or -1.5 per share, on volume of 933 shares. After opening the trading day at 176.96, shares of Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd traded in a close range. Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd currently has a total float of 85.86 million shares and on average sees 59,788 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 133 and high of 183. The Evolution Of The LSE In 200 Years \nTrade and commerce in the UK can be traced back to hundreds of years ago. Today, it plays an important role in global trade and commerce as one of the biggest and most significant contributors. \nIt is undeniable that the UK is one of the most developed countries in the world as well. Because of this and its constant strive for progress, the global economy is continuously shaping up to become bigger and better through the years. London Stock Exchange (LSE) \nThe LSE is the main stock exchange in the UK. It had been founded in 1801, making it one of the oldest stock exchanges in the world. \nToday, the LSE is considered as the biggest stock exchange in Europe and the third biggest one in the world. As of the end of the third quarter, more than 2,290 companies are listed on the LSE, bringing its total market capitalization to more than ‘6 trillion. \nPresently, the LSE Group (LSEG), which had been founded in October 2007 following the merger of the LSE and the Borsa Italiana, operates the LSE. Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index \nThe FTSE 100 is the benchmark blue-chip index in the UK. It measures the top 100 companies listed on the LSE as a free-float, market-capitalization-weighted index. As of September, the FTSE 100 has a total market capitalization of ‘1.70 trillion. \nThe FTSE 100 had been founded on January 3, 1984 with a base value of 1,000 points. It is currently operated by the FTSE Group, a subsidiary of LSEG. Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd is a stock traded on the U.K’s stock exchange. \nMost of the components of the FTSE 100 are international companies, which is why it is not a strong indicator of the UK economy. Nonetheless, it is a strong indicator of the LSE, representing more than 80% of the total market capitalization on the LSE. The FTSE 250, which measures the top 250 companies listed on the LSE, is a stronger indicator of the UK economy than the FTSE 100 because of its broad nature and most of its components being domestic companies. Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd has relatively good liquidity. \nThe FTSE 100 is rebalanced quarterly’ specifically every Wednesday immediately following the first Friday of March, June, September, and December. Components that have fallen short of the inclusion requirements are dropped to give way to those that have met all the said requirements. \nThe FTSE 100 had reached its all-time low of 427.50 points in February 1978; and its all-time high of 7,103.98 points in April 2015. Meanwhile, its best intraday high of 7,129 points had been reached on October 11. \nMany investors are banking on the promising growth of the European economy. Amid the pressing concerns of today, it is still ideal for investors to penetrate European equity markets such as that of the UK. \nBoasting with full potentials to realize its growth prospects, the UK economy guarantees meaningful investment returns for domestic and international investors alike. Those who still doubt this can simply look back through the hundreds of years that the UK economy had been tried and tested. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd. \nMore recent Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd (LON:WKOF) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “South Korea: Home Of The World’s Best Equity Opportunities” on May 05, 2015. Also Ft.com published the news titled: “Korea’s chaebols are looking cheap” on May 30, 2013. Gurufocus.com‘s news article titled: “Lotte Confectionery Has Been Growing With Sales” with publication date: March 03, 2017 was also an interesting one. \nWeiss Korea Opportunity Fund Ltd. is a closed-ended investment company. The company has market cap of 149.83 million GBP. The Company’s investment objective is to provide Shareholders with an attractive return on their investment, predominantly through long-term capital appreciation. It has a 4.35 P/E ratio.

      "text": "Kwangju Bank Co Ltd (192530) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Michael Collier \nShares of Kwangju Bank Co Ltd (KRX:192530) closed at 11950 yesterday. Kwangju Bank Co Ltd currently has a total float of 51.29 million shares and on average sees 58,932 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 9480 and high of 14250. KOSPI: A Powerful Indicator Of The Asian Economy \nSouth Korea has one of the most progressive, fast-paced economies in Asia. It is an influential global leader that helps drive growth in the Asian economy. Leading abilities of South Korean market help Kwangju Bank Co Ltd to attract more attention to its work. Without it, the region’s capacities are surely minimized. \nOne of the most important factors backing South Korea’s successful economy is the Korea Exchange (KRX), which boasts with over $1 trillion in total market capitalization. Despite being one of the youngest stock exchanges in Asia, it has already transformed the conduct of trade and commerce in South Korea. It brings foreign investors to Kwangju Bank Co Ltd and other companies. Stock Market Division of the KRX \nUnder the Korea Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange Act, the KRX is divided into three: 1) the Stock Market Division; 2) the KOSDAQ Market Division; and 3) the Derivatives Market Division. All publicly traded companies are listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. \nThe Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), which was first published in 1983, is one of the main real-time economy indicators in South Korea as it tracks the performances of all the companies listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. That being said, the KOSPI had to be divided into several sub-indices. These include the KOSPI 50, which monitors the 50 most active stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX; the KOSPI 100, which monitors the 100 most active stocks; and the KOSPI 200, which monitors the 200 most active stocks out of more than 700 stocks. A stock can be included in the KOSPI 50 and the KOSPI 100 only if it is included in the KOSPI 200. At the same time, a stock can only be included in the KOSPI 50 if it is included in the KOSPI 100. Kwangju Bank Co Ltd is inside the KOSPI trading operations. \nThe KOSPI tracks stocks on the Stock Market Division of the KRX based on market capitalization using the base value of 100. The base date is January 4, 1980. Similarly, the KOSPI 200, which represents roughly 70% of the total market valuation on the Stock Market Division of the KRX, monitors its components using the base value of 100. The base date is April 2007. Historical Statistics \nIn January 1981, the KOSPI had reached its all-time low of 93.10 points. In May 2011, it had reached its all-time high of 2,228.98 points. On the other hand, in June 1998, the KOSPI 200 had reached its all-time low of 31.96 points; and in April 2007, it had reached its all-time high of 100 points. \nWhen the Asian economy was recovering from the financial crisis that had started in Thailand, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day gain of 8.50% in June 1998. Meanwhile, after the 9/11 tragedy that had shaken the global economy, the KOSPI had recorded its largest one-day decline of 12.02% in September 2001. \nBy 2019, Asia is highly expected to account for 26% of the global financial wealth, demonstrating a 2% representation growth in just five years. The best way to bank on that fast-paced growth is to invest on stocks listed on the Stock Market Division of the KRX. Investors which work with Kwangju Bank Co Ltd hope to find the best quality there. \nMore news for Kwangju Bank Co Ltd (KRX:192530) were recently published by: Moodys.com, which released: “Moody’s revises outlook of five Korean banks to negative; downgrades Woori Bank” on April 14, 2016. Moodys.com‘s article titled: “Moody’s: Korean bank and liquidity profiles stable on continued monetary easing” and published on September 06, 2016 is yet another important article. \nKwangju Bank, formerly KJB Financial Group Co., Ltd, is a holding firm engaged in the management of subsidiaries.

      "text": "Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA (NETC4) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 23 \nOctober 23, 2017 - By Stephen Andrade \nShares of Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA (BVMF:NETC4) closed at 0 yesterday. Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA currently has a total float of 249.66M shares and on average sees 100 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 18.98 and high of 63.85. Ibovespa: A Witness to Brazilian Economy’s Success \nUnknown to the knowledge of many, Brazil is one of today’s fastest-growing economies and the reason behind it is a successfully emerging trade and commerce industry. Needless to say, it is a true pride of the South American economy. Brazil gives chances to a lot of big companies as Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA to receive new clients. Brazilian Mercantile and Futures (BM&F) Bovespa \nThe BM&F Bovespa is the main stock exchange in Brazil. Founded on August 23, 1890 as a public entity, it had long been under the strict supervision of the government. By the late 1960s, the government had loosened its grip on the BM&F Bovespa. \nIn 1972, electronic trading had finally been implemented to make things easier for brokers and investors alike. By the end of the decade, the Sistema Privado de Operacões por Telefone (SPOT) or the Private System of Telephone Trading, a telephone trading system, had been introduced. \nThe Mega Bolsa, an electronic trading system, had replaced the old one in 1997. Two years later, the Home Broker, an internet-based trading system that enabled individual investors to trade from home online, had been launched. \nThe BM&F Bovespa had finally been privatized as a profit entity in 2007. It officially became the BM&F Bovespa when the BM&F Exchange and the Bovespa had merged on May 8, 2008 to create a bigger and consolidated stock exchange in Brazil. Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA became one of the active participants of the trading system. \nOn August 17, 2011, the BM&F Bovespa had recorded its largest daily trading volume of $14.80 billion. On June 18, 2012, it had become one of the founding members of the Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative of the United Nations (UN). As of December 2015, more than 450 companies are listed on the BM&F Bovespa. Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index \nThe Ibovespa is the benchmark index in Brazil that weighs the top 50 companies listed on the BM&F Bovespa as a market-capitalization-weighted index. \nConsequently, it represents roughly 70% of the total market capitalization on the BM&F Bovespa. Founded in 1968, it is also the oldest index measuring BM&F Bovespa companies. \nRebalancing of the Ibovespa happens quarterly to ensure its efficient representation of the trade and commerce environment in Brazil. In order for a company to become eligible for inclusion as an Ibovespa component, it must have been listed and traded on the BM&F Bovespa for not less than a calendar year prior to a particular rebalancing period. Also, more than 80% of its shares must be traded on the BM&F Bovespa to guarantee compelling activity. \nThe Ibovespa uses a base value of 100 points, which has a base date of January 2, 1968. \nThe Ibovespa had hit its all-time low of 0 in January 1972. On May 20, 2008, it had hit its all-time high of 73,516 points, which was primarily driven by a positive inflation outlook that caused major industries to surge. Nine days later, the Ibovespa had an intraday high of 73,920 points. \nInvestors must take advantage of the growth of the South American economy by investing on BM&F Bovespa stocks, especially if they are looking for meaningful long-term returns. Investors turn their attention to the Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA equities. \nMore recent Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA (BVMF:NETC4) news were published by: Seekingalpha.com which released: “Net Servicos: 4.2% Gross Return In Three Weeks With Very Low Downside Risk” on November 21, 2013. Also Theglobeandmail.com published the news titled: “Cash in on Olympics 2016 with these Brazilian stocks” on August 14, 2012. Prnewswire.com‘s news article titled: “NII Holdings Announces New President of Nextel Brazil and Appointment of Board …” with publication date: August 24, 2015 was also an interesting one. \nNet Servicos de Comunicacao SA is a Brazil firm that controls a group of cable subscription television companies. The company has market cap of $. The Firm offers cable television services under NET brand name and Internet access under NET VIRTUA brand name through several cable networks located in the country’s largest cities.

      "text": "Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. (3331) Is Yet to See Trading Action on Oct 24 \nOctober 24, 2017 - By Michael Collier \nShares of Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. (TYO:3331) closed at 236 yesterday. Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. currently has a total float of 10.26 million shares and on average sees shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 28 and high of 550. TSE: Lifting Japan Since 1878 \nJapan is one of the best countries in the world. It is home to the best innovations and a compelling economy as well. Of course, such is the case because of the nation’s rich equity market. How It Came to Be \nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) was established in 1878, being one of the first stock exchanges in Asia. When the World War II (WWII) broke out, the TSE has consolidated with five other stock exchanges in Japan in 1943, forming a broader TSE. Two years later, the TSE had to close amid the repercussions of the WWII. Nonetheless, in 1949, it was relaunched to build the Japanese economy from the ground up. Japan has never moved backwards since then. \nThe Nihon Keizai Shimbun or Nikkei 225 or Nikkei Stock Average, which opened on September 7, 1950, is the benchmark index monitoring the 225 best-performing stocks on the TSE. Unlike most indices that are measured based on market capitalization, the Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted index. It tracks the most active stocks on the TSE using the base value of 176.21 and the base date of May 1949, the time when the TSE reopened. \nThe components of the Nikkei 225 are reviewed annually, particularly every September. Any changes made during the annual review are to reflect in the following month. \nIn the 1980s, the Nikkei 225 had its most glorious decade. As the government strived to recover in the post-war period, it had used monetary stimuli to drive the economy. Stock prices had tripled in the latter part of the decade. That time, the TSE had made up 60% of the total market capitalization in the world. \nOn December 29, 1989, the Nikkei 225 had recorded its all-time high of 38,957.44. Upon reaching its peak, however, the TSE had fallen roughly 33% come 1990. \nThe Nikkei 225 Futures was first introduced on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 1986; on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) in 1988; and on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1990. Japanese Equity Market Today \nWhen the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 broke out; the Japanese equity market is one of those that had taken a great hit. In October 2008, the Nikkei 225 had sunk below the 7,000 mark, down by about 80% from its all-time high. Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. is a stock traded on the Japan stock exchange. \nNonetheless, the Nikkei 225 was still able to recover. Last year, it had reached a 20,000 mark after Japan was able to recoup from the 2011 earthquake. \nLike the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the US, the Nikkei 225 is today’s commonly quoted index in Japan. Weighing 225 blue-chip companies, it is the leading indicators of the present state of the Japanese economy as well as near-term and long-term forecasts. Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. has relatively good liquidity. \nThe Nikkei 225 is also one of the fastest indices in Asia, boasting with a speed of 15 seconds since January 2010. \nJapan is already one of the world’s economy giants and it still continues to grow. This is why investors are making long-term investments in TSE stocks as they bet on the Japanese economy. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd.. \nAnother recent and important Zakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. (TYO:3331) news was published by Reuters.com which published an article titled: “Zakkaya Bulldog updates merger with merge with Tokushima-based company” on October 15, 2015. \nZakkaya Bulldog Co., Ltd. is a company engaged in the operation of chain-stores that sell miscellaneous goods. The company has market cap of $2.42 billion. The Firm operates retail stores under the names Bulldog and Thanade. It currently has negative earnings. The Company’s Bulldog stores offer fashion miscellaneous goods including accessories, costumes, party goods and battery toys, among others.

What Shapes Asia’s Largest Economy \nThe Asian economy is rapidly growing today and as the second biggest economy globally, China plays a big part in it. In line with this, it is important to know as well what shapes Asia’s largest country in terms of economy into a massive success. Economy rise help some companies including BEIJING THUNISOFT CORP LTD to try themselves on the big market arena. Building from the Ground Up \nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), operated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is one of China’s primary stock exchanges along with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In Asia, it is the second largest stock exchange. Globally, the SSE is the fifth biggest stock exchange in terms of market capitalization. Companies like BEIJING THUNISOFT CORP LTD with strong potential and good liquidity are on demand. \nThe SSE had already been founded in the 1860s. However, eventually, it had to close down in 1941 when Japan occupied Shanghai. It was reopened on November 26, 1990 and operations officially started on December 19, 1990. \nCompanies listed on the SSE are classified into two categories: 1) A shares and B shares. The main difference between the two categories is in terms of currency. A shares are traded in yuan while B shares are traded in US dollar (USD). \nBefore, only Chinese citizens were allowed to trade A shares. However, the limitation was lifted in 2002, enabling domestic and international investors to trade both A shares and B shares. With expanded opportunities for traders, the Chinese economy had since then grown faster than ever. BEIJING THUNISOFT CORP LTD had to quickly adjust. \nPre-market trading on the SSE starts at 9:15 a.m. and ends at 9:25 a.m. Regular trading starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 3:00 p.m. with a two-hour break that starts at 11:31 a.m. and ends at 1:29 p.m. The SSE Composite Index \nThe SSE Composite Index is the benchmark index that tracks all companies listed on the SSE. Because of its broad scope, it is composed of three sub-indices: 1) the SSE 380; 2) the SSE 180; and 3) the SSE 50. These sub-indices are intended to provide more reliable representations of the Chinese equity market given the broad nature of the SSE. \nThe SSE 380 monitors the top 380 stocks on the SSE; the SSE 180 monitors the top 180 stocks; and the SSE 50 monitors the top 50 stocks. In order for stocks to be included in the SSE 50, they first have to be included in the SSE 180; and in order for them to be included in the SSE 180, they first have to be included in the SSE 380. \nThe SSE Composite Index has a base date of December 19, 1990 and a base value of 100. Its all-time high of 6,092.06 had been recorded in October 2007 while its all-time low of 99.98 had been recorded in December 1990. \nToday is the perfect time to penetrate the Chinese equity market. There is no better way to take advantage an immense economic growth than to invest in Asia’s largest economy. With promising growth opportunities and countless potential, investors will surely enjoy the many benefits of investing on the SSE.

      "text": "ARTIZA NETWORKS, INC. (6778) Moved Up 0.12% on Oct 24 \nOctober 24, 2017 - By Hazel Jackson \nShares of ARTIZA NETWORKS, INC. (TYO:6778) last traded at 839, representing a move of 0.12%, or 1 per share, on volume of 10,900 shares. After opening the trading day at 839, shares of ARTIZA NETWORKS, INC. traded in a close range. ARTIZA NETWORKS, INC. currently has a total float of 8.07M shares and on average sees shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 555 and high of 1013. TSE: Lifting Japan Since 1878 \nJapan is one of the best countries in the world. It is home to the best innovations and a compelling economy as well. Of course, such is the case because of the nation’s rich equity market. How It Came to Be \nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) was established in 1878, being one of the first stock exchanges in Asia. When the World War II (WWII) broke out, the TSE has consolidated with five other stock exchanges in Japan in 1943, forming a broader TSE. Two years later, the TSE had to close amid the repercussions of the WWII. Nonetheless, in 1949, it was relaunched to build the Japanese economy from the ground up. Japan has never moved backwards since then. \nThe Nihon Keizai Shimbun or Nikkei 225 or Nikkei Stock Average, which opened on September 7, 1950, is the benchmark index monitoring the 225 best-performing stocks on the TSE. Unlike most indices that are measured based on market capitalization, the Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted index. It tracks the most active stocks on the TSE using the base value of 176.21 and the base date of May 1949, the time when the TSE reopened. \nThe components of the Nikkei 225 are reviewed annually, particularly every September. Any changes made during the annual review are to reflect in the following month. \nIn the 1980s, the Nikkei 225 had its most glorious decade. As the government strived to recover in the post-war period, it had used monetary stimuli to drive the economy. Stock prices had tripled in the latter part of the decade. That time, the TSE had made up 60% of the total market capitalization in the world. \nOn December 29, 1989, the Nikkei 225 had recorded its all-time high of 38,957.44. Upon reaching its peak, however, the TSE had fallen roughly 33% come 1990. \nThe Nikkei 225 Futures was first introduced on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 1986; on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) in 1988; and on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1990. Japanese Equity Market Today \nWhen the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 broke out; the Japanese equity market is one of those that had taken a great hit. In October 2008, the Nikkei 225 had sunk below the 7,000 mark, down by about 80% from its all-time high. ARTIZA NETWORKS, INC. is a stock traded on the Japan stock exchange. \nNonetheless, the Nikkei 225 was still able to recover. Last year, it had reached a 20,000 mark after Japan was able to recoup from the 2011 earthquake. \nLike the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the US, the Nikkei 225 is today’s commonly quoted index in Japan. Weighing 225 blue-chip companies, it is the leading indicators of the present state of the Japanese economy as well as near-term and long-term forecasts. ARTIZA NETWORKS, INC. has relatively good liquidity. \nThe Nikkei 225 is also one of the fastest indices in Asia, boasting with a speed of 15 seconds since January 2010. \nJapan is already one of the world’s economy giants and it still continues to grow. This is why investors are making long-term investments in TSE stocks as they bet on the Japanese economy.

More >>  31   This   \nBy MICHAEL BIESECKERAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the   Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips",

The banned substance was an opioid pain reliever. \nCalls to Seavey's cellphone weren't immediately returned. \n___ \n2:40 p.m. \nOrganizers of Alaska's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race are again defending their decision to withhold the identity of a competitor who had several dogs test positive for a prohibited drug in this year's race. \nOfficials say in a statement that they were not satisfied they could prove intent on the musher's part. So they modified a rule dealing with canine drug use that will go into effect for next year's race. \nRace organizers say their statement was sent Sunday to the Iditarod Official Finishers Club of current and past race mushers. \nThe club on Monday called on the musher to be named within 72 hours, saying 83 current and former competitors signed a statement making the demand. \nIditarod officials did not directly address the mushers' demand. \nRace officials said last week that several dogs had an opioid pain reliever in their systems after one musher's sled dog team finished the race in March. \n___ \n11 a.m. \nScores of mushers are demanding that organizers of Alaska's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race identify a competitor who had several dogs test positive for a prohibited drug in this year's race. \nThe Iditarod Official Finishers Club released a statement Monday signed by 83 current and former competitors who are calling for the musher to be named within 72 hours. \nThe demand came after the group held an emergency meeting Sunday to discuss how organizers of the nearly 1,000-mile race handled its first instance of dogs testing positive for a banned drug. \nRace officials didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. They said last week that several dogs had an opioid pain reliever in their systems after the team finished the race in March. \nOfficials have refused to identify the musher. About Us",

It was created by Trump for a charity auction in Florida during the time he opened his Mar-a-Lago estate as a private club in 1995. \nJulien's Auctions says the piece signed by Trump went for less than $100 the first time it was sold. \nIn a statement Monday, Hirschfeld says he plans to hang it in his offices a couple of blocks from Trump Tower. \nThe Associated Press",

Incredibly, the baby obeyed. Kaylee Bays was pregnant with her third child, a girl, and thought she was going into labour last week, but it stopped. She went back to work to her job as a judicial assistant at the Fourth District Court in Provo, and jokingly asked Judge Lynn Davis to serve an eviction notice on her baby. He did. And It worked. Less than 12 hours later, baby Gretsel was born, the Daily Herald reported . Bays said Davis told her it was his first baby eviction notice in his 31 years as a judge. \"He told me, 'If it really works, I want it framed.' It did, and I'm going to frame it for him,\" Bays said. Bays said the eviction notice gave her baby three days to \"vacate the premises.\" The notice was addressed to Gretsel at Mommy Belly Lane, in Womb, Utah. \"She came 12 hours later. So far, she's a good listener,\" she joked. \"She didn't want to be in contempt of court.\" ___ Information from: The Daily Herald, http://www.heraldextra.com Editors' Picks",

(AP Photo/Bullit Marquez) By: Staff The Associated Press Published on CLARK, Philippines — The Australian defence chief says her country will deploy forces to train Filipino troops on urban warfare following a disastrous siege by pro-Islamic State group militants on Marawi city in the southern Philippines. Philippine troops accustomed to battling insurgents in jungle terrain struggled for months to fight the hundreds of militants who took cover in buildings and houses in Marawi. Officials finally declared Monday that the deadly insurrection had been crushed. Defence Minister Marise Payne said Tuesday Australian defence forces would provide training on a range of urban combat skills to Filipino soldiers and marines in Philippine military bases to help combat the extremists' brutal tactics. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana says the Philippine military plans to build urban-fighting training centres",

The lawyers want to question Anglin's father and brother under oath about his whereabouts. \nSiriusXM Radio show host Dean Obeidallah's federal lawsuit says Anglin falsely labeled Obeidallah as the \"mastermind\" behind a deadly bombing at a concert in England. Obeidallah said he received death threats after the article's publication. \nObeidallah's lawyers say private investigators believe Anglin lives in the Worthington, Ohio, area. The lawyers suspect Anglin's relatives are \"complicit\" in his alleged efforts to avoid being served with the lawsuit they filed in August. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Asian stocks were mostly higher Monday, with Japan's benchmark rising on the back of an election victory by the prime minister's ruling party, which had promised stability and growth. Shizuo Kambayashi AP Photo Asian stock markets slightly higher after Wall Street loss \nAP Business Writer October 23, 2017 8:49 PM BEIJING \nAsian stock markets edged up Tuesday after Wall Street slid overnight as investors sought new drivers for trading activity. \nKEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.2 percent to 21,733.10 points and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.1 percent to 5,901.10. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 3 points to 3,382.33 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 6 points to 28,309.44. Seoul's Kospi added 2 points to 2,492.28 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur also rose. Singapore and Manila retreated. \nWALL STREET: Industrial and technology companies and retailers all stumbled. General Electric suffered its worst one-day loss in six years following downgrades from analysts. Analysts said markets showed an unusual combination of near-record prices and investor calm. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.4 percent to 2,564.98. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2 percent to 23,273.96. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6 percent to 6,586.83. \nANALYST'S QUOTE: \"It's was all quiet on the Western Front in European and U.S. trade and a pause after what has been such a strong run for global equity and credit markets,\" said Chris Weston of IG in a report. \"Whether the gains can continue this week is obviously yet to be seen, but I remain a bull, but of the view that these markets are tired, fatigued and need new information to fuel the beast.\" \nCHINA POLITICS: China's ruling Communist Party is preparing to appoint President Xi Jinping this week to a second five-year term as leader and unveil a new ruling inner circle around him. After spending his first term cementing his status as China's most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, Xi is widely expected to shift focus to economic policy. In a speech last week, Xi promised to promote entrepreneurial activity but also affirmed party ambitions to build up state-owned companies that dominate banking, energy and other industries. Five of the seven members of the party's Standing Committee are due to retire under informal age limits, clearing the way for Xi to promote allies. \nJAPAN MANUFACTURING: A survey of manufacturers showed activity weakened this month but still grew relatively strongly. The preliminary version of the purchasing managers' index declined to 52.5 from 52.9 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity accelerating. The output component of the survey declined to 52.6 from 53.2 but still showed activity growing. Other components showed export volume rising. \nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 4 cents to $51.94 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 6 cents on Monday to close at $51.90. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 5 cents to $57.42 in London. It fell 38 cents the previous session to $57.37. \nCURRENCY: The dollar declined to 113.35 yen from Monday's 113.43 yen. The euro gained to $1.1764 from $1.1749. Never miss a local story.

Incredibly, the baby obeyed. \nKaylee Bays was pregnant with her third child, a girl, and thought she was going into labor last week, but it stopped. \nShe went back to work to her job as a judicial assistant at the Fourth District Court in Provo, and jokingly asked Judge Lynn Davis to serve an eviction notice on her baby. \nHe did. And It worked. Less than 12 hours later, baby Gretsel was born, the Daily Herald reported . \nBays said Davis told her it was his first baby eviction notice in his 31 years as a judge. \n\"He told me, 'If it really works, I want it framed.' It did, and I'm going to frame it for him,\" Bays said. \nBays said the eviction notice gave her baby three days to \"vacate the premises.\" \nThe notice was addressed to Gretsel at Mommy Belly Lane, in Womb, Utah. \n\"She came 12 hours later. So far, she's a good listener,\" she joked. \"She didn't want to be in contempt of court.\" \n___ \nInformation from: The Daily Herald, http://www.heraldextra.com \nCopyright © The Associated Press.

      "text": "Study: Climate change costs taxpayers billions By MICHAEL BIESECKER Associated Press 11:13 pm \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips Related Links",

      "text": "Indonesia parliament endorses draconian law on groups \nThe Associated Press October 24, 2017 4:10 AM JAKARTA, Indonesia \nIndonesia's parliament has endorsed a presidential decree that gives officials sweeping powers to ban organizations deemed as threats to national unity. \nThe decree, signed in July by President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, has already been used to ban Hizbut Tahrir, an Islamic organization that advocates for a global caliphate. It required parliamentary approval to become permanent law. \nThe decree allows officials to sidestep the courts when banning organizations, and rights groups have criticized it as draconian. \nLawmakers from 10 parties, including Widodo's governing coalition, voted 314 to 131 on Tuesday to amend a law regulating mass organizations in line with the decree. More than three quarters of lawmakers in the 560-seat legislature were present for the vote. \nAbout 1,000 people from Muslim groups protested outside parliament.",

      "text": "By Scott Neuman • 3 hours ago Pro-democracy activist Nathan Law, center, walks out from the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, on Tuesday. Vincent Yu / AP \nHong Kong's highest court released on bail two leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy demonstrations against Beijing's rule over the territory. \nHong Kong's Final Court of Appeals freed Joshua Wong and Nathan Law pending appeal of their cases. \nAccording to The South China Morning Post: \n\"The two ... leaders were convicted alongside former student union leader Alex Chow Yong-kang, 27, over their roles at a protest that led to a 79-day occupation of major roads across Hong Kong in 2014, during which protesters demanded greater democracy. \nAll three completed the non-custodial sentences handed down last year by a magistrate. But in August, after a review sought by the government , the Court of Appeal found those terms manifestly inadequate and gave them jail time instead. \nThe trio are appealing against their new sentences and an application for a hearing for leave to appeal has been set for November 7.\" \nAs The New York Times reported in April : \"Mr. Wong and Mr. Chow were found guilty last year of unlawful assembly, while Mr. Law was found guilty of inciting people to take part in the assembly.\" \nWong and Law were required to post 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,400) for bail, surrender their passports and travel documents and report to police once a week, the Post reports. \nThe Associated Press notes: \"The decision to release Wong, the city's most famous activist, and Law, a disqualified lawmaker, coincidentally came the same day China's Communist Party was ending a twice-a-decade party congress in Beijing that expanded President Xi Jinping's power. There appeared to be no link, though the two events highlighted the widening rift between mainland China and semiautonomous Hong Kong.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

      "text": "October 24, 2017 4:34 AM ROME \nRacist chants at every opportunity. \nA Lazio banner in the intra-city derby nearly 20 years ago aimed at Roma supporters that read: \"Auschwitz Is Your Homeland; The Ovens Are Your Homes.\" \nAnother message honoring the slain Serbian paramilitary leader, Arkan. \nLazio fans have a long history of racism and anti-Semitism and the Roman club's supporters established another low over the weekend. They littered the Stadio Olimpico with superimposed images of Anne Frank — the young diarist who died in the Holocaust — wearing a jersey of city rival Roma. \n\"The anti-Semitic squalor that prompted some Lazio fans to make fun of even Anne Frank's memory is a shameful gesture,\" said ex-Italian Premier Matteo Renzi. \"Obviously we're talking about a small minority but not shedding light on this news would be a mistake. \n\"Because when things like this happen it's important that children know and learn how to deal with a complete lack of dignity,\" Renzi added. \nWith a long stadium ban likely and police having opened a criminal inquiry, Lazio president Claudio Lotito sought Tuesday to disassociate the club from its hard-core \"ultra\" fans. \nIn a visit to Rome's main synagogue, Lotito said the club would intensify its efforts to combat racism and anti-Semitism and organize an annual trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp with some 200 young Lazio fans to \"educate them not to forget.\" \nThe northern curva (end) of the stadium where Lazio's \"ultra\" fans usually sit was closed on Sunday for the match with Cagliari, due to racist chanting during a match against Sassuolo earlier this month. \nAs a result, Lazio decided to open the southern end and let the ultras in where Roma's hard-core fans sit for their home matches in the stadium both sides share. \n\"Unfortunately it's something that affects a lot of clubs, a lot of fan groups and a lot of cities. But you can't generalize,\" Italian Players Association president Damiano Tommasi said in an interview with The Associated Press last week looking ahead to the Lazio-Cagliari match. \n\"You've got to educate as much as possible those who go to the stadium for these reasons,\" Tommasi added. \"And leave them out. Certainly the best solution isn't letting them in to another area of the stadium.\" \nLazio beat Cagliari 3-0 for its fourth straight win and is fourth in the standings, level on points with six-time defending champion Juventus. Stadium cleaners found the anti-Semitic stickers on Monday. \nAntonio Tajani, the head of the European Parliament, denounced those responsible during a session in Brussels on Tuesday, saying that anti-Semitism has no place. \n\"Using the image of Anne Frank as an insult against others is a very grave matter,\" Tajani said. \nTajani, who is Italian, said the EU must remain a place of religious tolerance. \nLazio's ultra group, the \"Irriducibili\" (diehards), expressed surprise at the widespread outrage. \n\"There are other cases that we feel should lead the newscasts and fill newspaper pages,\" the group said in a statement on Facebook. \nThe latest partial stadium ban stemmed from derogatory chants directed at visiting Sassuolo players Claud Adjapong and Alfred Duncan. \nAdjapong was born in Italy to Ghanaian parents and has represented Italy Under-19s. Duncan is from Ghana. \nLazio will also be without fans in the northern end when Udinese visits on Nov. 5, as it was also decided to apply a sanction that had been conditionally suspended for racist chanting during the Rome derby in April. \nAlso this season, Lazio beat Belgian side Zulte Waregem 2-0 in a Europa League match behind closed doors due to punishment from UEFA for racist chants aimed at a Sparta Prague player in the Roman side's last continental appearance two seasons ago. \nThe club promoted an anti-racism initiative for the Cagliari game, saying it was up to other fans to educate the offending supporters until their \"ignorance and lack of respect for the most elementary rules of coexistence disappear once and for all\" from soccer stadiums. \n\"There are no justifications. These incidents must be met with disapproval, without any ifs, ands or buts,\" Sports Minister Luca Lotti said. \"I'm sure that the responsible authorities will shed light on what happened and that those responsible will quickly be identified and punished.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Nicole Winfield contributed. \n___ \nMore AP Serie A coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/SerieA",

Metropolitan officials attributed the excessive reading to Tokyo ’s record summertime rainfall that affected sewage processing capacity. LOAD COMMENTS ()",

(AP) - A judge has postponed the trial of a former Kentucky high school principal facing dozens of child pornography counts stemming from allegations that he uploaded nude images from students' confiscated cellphones. Hardin County assistant prosecutor Teresa Logsdon told The News-Enterprise that the trial for Stephen Kyle Goodlett, which had been set to start on Monday, is on hold. A new date hasn't been set. Logsdon said the trial was delayed after Goodlett's attorney filed a motion to dismiss earlier this month alleging double jeopardy since he was charged in federal and state court. Goodlett pleaded guilty in August to federal charges of transportation of child pornography and possession of child pornography. He had been scheduled for sentencing on Oct. 20, but that has been pushed back until Nov. 9, according to a court order. \n© 2017 Associated Press",

Lazio soccer team president Claudio Lotito gives a statement to the press after laying a wreath outside Rome's Synagogue, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2017. Lazio fans have a long history of racism and anti-Semitism and the Roman club'... (Angelo Carconi/ANSA via AP, files). FILE - In this Oct. 1, 2017 file photo, Lazio fans display a banner reading in Italian \"Banned fans with us, vile cops\" during a Serie A soccer match between Sassuolo and Lazio at the Olympic stadium in Rome. Lazio ... \nBy ANDREW DAMPFAP Sports Writer \nROME (AP) - Racist chants at every opportunity. \nA Lazio banner in the intra-city derby nearly 20 years ago aimed at Roma supporters that read: \"Auschwitz Is Your Homeland; The Ovens Are Your Homes.\" \nAnother message honoring the slain Serbian paramilitary leader, Arkan. \nLazio fans have a long history of racism and anti-Semitism and the Roman club's supporters established another low over the weekend. They littered the Stadio Olimpico with superimposed images of Anne Frank - the young diarist who died in the Holocaust - wearing a jersey of city rival Roma. \n\"The anti-Semitic squalor that prompted some Lazio fans to make fun of even Anne Frank's memory is a shameful gesture,\" said ex-Italian Premier Matteo Renzi. \"Obviously we're talking about a small minority but not shedding light on this news would be a mistake. \n\"Because when things like this happen it's important that children know and learn how to deal with a complete lack of dignity,\" Renzi added. \nWith a long stadium ban likely and police having opened a criminal inquiry, Lazio president Claudio Lotito sought Tuesday to disassociate the club from its hard-core \"ultra\" fans. \nIn a visit to Rome's main synagogue, Lotito said the club would intensify its efforts to combat racism and anti-Semitism and organize an annual trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp with some 200 young Lazio fans to \"educate them not to forget.\" \nThe northern curva (end) of the stadium where Lazio's \"ultra\" fans usually sit was closed on Sunday for the match with Cagliari, due to racist chanting during a match against Sassuolo earlier this month. \nAs a result, Lazio decided to open the southern end and let the ultras in where Roma's hard-core fans sit for their home matches in the stadium both sides share. \n\"Unfortunately it's something that affects a lot of clubs, a lot of fan groups and a lot of cities. But you can't generalize,\" Italian Players Association president Damiano Tommasi said in an interview with The Associated Press last week looking ahead to the Lazio-Cagliari match. \n\"You've got to educate as much as possible those who go to the stadium for these reasons,\" Tommasi added. \"And leave them out. Certainly the best solution isn't letting them in to another area of the stadium.\" \nLazio beat Cagliari 3-0 for its fourth straight win and is fourth in the standings, level on points with six-time defending champion Juventus. Stadium cleaners found the anti-Semitic stickers on Monday. \nAntonio Tajani, the head of the European Parliament, denounced those responsible during a session in Brussels on Tuesday, saying that anti-Semitism has no place. \n\"Using the image of Anne Frank as an insult against others is a very grave matter,\" Tajani said. \nTajani, who is Italian, said the EU must remain a place of religious tolerance. \nLazio's ultra group, the \"Irriducibili\" (diehards), expressed surprise at the widespread outrage. \n\"There are other cases that we feel should lead the newscasts and fill newspaper pages,\" the group said in a statement on Facebook. \nThe latest partial stadium ban stemmed from derogatory chants directed at visiting Sassuolo players Claud Adjapong and Alfred Duncan. \nAdjapong was born in Italy to Ghanaian parents and has represented Italy Under-19s. Duncan is from Ghana. \nLazio will also be without fans in the northern end when Udinese visits on Nov. 5, as it was also decided to apply a sanction that had been conditionally suspended for racist chanting during the Rome derby in April. \nAlso this season, Lazio beat Belgian side Zulte Waregem 2-0 in a Europa League match behind closed doors due to punishment from UEFA for racist chants aimed at a Sparta Prague player in the Roman side's last continental appearance two seasons ago. \nThe club promoted an anti-racism initiative for the Cagliari game, saying it was up to other fans to educate the offending supporters until their \"ignorance and lack of respect for the most elementary rules of coexistence disappear once and for all\" from soccer stadiums. \n\"There are no justifications. These incidents must be met with disapproval, without any ifs, ands or buts,\" Sports Minister Luca Lotti said. \"I'm sure that the responsible authorities will shed light on what happened and that those responsible will quickly be identified and punished.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Nicole Winfield contributed. \n___ \nMore AP Serie A coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/SerieA \n___ \nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf",

It was created by Trump for a charity auction in Florida during the time he opened his Mar-a-Lago estate as a private club in 1995. \nJulien's Auctions says the piece signed by Trump went for less than $100 the first time it was sold. \nIn a statement Monday, Hirschfeld says he plans to hang it in his offices a couple of blocks from Trump Tower. \nThe Associated Press",

FILE – In this March 22, 2017, file photo, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams arrives for his arraignment on bribery and extortion charges at the federal courthouse in Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court... \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Philadelphia's former top prosecutor is scheduled to be sentenced after pleading guilty in a corruption scandal. \nCourt records show that Seth Williams is set to appear in federal court on Tuesday afternoon. He faces up to five years in prison for a single count of accepting a bribe from a businessman. \nThe ex-district attorney was disbarred by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last week. \nThe two-term Democrat pleaded guilty in June, two weeks into a trial that included damaging testimony about a stream of money and gifts showered on him. A federal judge said he \"sold\" his office and ordered him immediately jailed. \nWilliams was Philadelphia's first black district attorney. \nHe spent years as an assistant prosecutor and was previously tasked with rooting out corruption as the city's inspector general.",

      "text": "Coyotes Embrace Long Trip, Chance to Bond Arizona begins a five-game journey on Tuesday at the Islanders by Dave Vest @davest4yotes / Coyotes Sr. Director of News Content \nNEW YORK - The Coyotes are starting a challenging five-game road trip on Tuesday still seeking their first win of the season after eight tries. \nMorale at the team's practice on Monday at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., was good because the consensus around the team is that the current won-loss record is not indicative of the team they are or, more importantly, the team they feel they can still become. \nCenter Brad Richardson likened the team's funk to a few he experienced as a member of the Los Angeles Kings in 2011-12. That team endured two five-game losing streaks within the first 30 games of the season and eventually won the Stanley Cup as the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference. \n\"Things can get turned around, you just can't let it go on for too long,\" Richardson said. \"We've had some good games. We were right there and then at the end they score with just a few minutes left. That's happened a few times, but one win could change everything around and get some bounces going our way. Obviously you want to get off to a good start and that didn't happen. We have to try to figure out a way to turn it around and just get one (win) and hopefully that can spur us and turn us the other way.\" \nArizona will begin its trip vs. the New York Islanders, who have earned five out of a possible six points at home. Games vs. the New York Rangers, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Detroit will follow, in that order, every other night, except for the games at Philadelphia and Detroit, which will be played on back-to-back nights next week. The five teams are a combined 10-8-4 at home this season. \n\"Everybody knows road trips are tough, especially when they are so long,\" forward Tobias Rieder said. \"I think it's a good thing. We have time to grow together as a team more and start winning.\" \nForward Jordan Martinook agreed. \n\"Whenever a team gets on the road it feels like you can kind of come together that way,\" Martinook said. \"There's more of a real team-like feel on the road. Hopefully we can continue that good building of a team, and hopefully it will translate into wins.\" \nThe Coyotes flew to New York on Sunday, an off day, and practiced later in the day on Monday in an effort to get the players better acclimated to the time change. Travel for the first three games of the trip, all in the New York City area, will be minimal, and being anchored in the same hotel in Lower Manhattan for five nights is a plus. \n\"It's always fun being in the big city and playing the teams here,\" Rieder said. \"It should be exciting. I don't think there's any distractions here. Everyone is a professional and we know what we're here for, so it's pretty easy to focus on hockey.\" \n\nHead Coach Rick Tocchet, a former player who skated in 1,144 NHL games, is hoping the players will use the time together to speak openly to each other about the 0-7-1 start to the season. \n\"It's big because you're together a lot, whether it's dinners, practices, hotel lobbies,\" Tocchet said. \"...You're with the guys a lot. Some things might come up. You might say to a player, 'Hey man, we need you to do this' or 'You haven't been playing hard enough.' Things come up when you're around a person a lot. So I think that's why people say this bonding stuff, it does work.\"",

(CNN Money) \n(CNN Money) -- Amazon has confirmed the obvious: It's received a lot of interest from cities vying to host its second headquarters. \nThe tech giant said on Monday that 238 cities and regions put in a bid for the opportunity. The proposals span across 54 states, provinces, districts and territories across North America. \nAmazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September, sending cities into a frenzy. The company expects to invest more than $5 billion to build the facility and will create as many as 50,000 \"high-paying\" jobs. \nAmazon says the new headquarters, dubbed HQ2, will be a \"full equal\" to its Seattle campus. \nCities have made elaborate and creative gestures in an effort to woo Amazon. Kansas City Mayor Sly James wrote five-star reviews for 1,000 random items on Amazon's website; Tucson sent Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a giant cactus; and New York City lit up landmarks like the Empire State Building in \"Amazon orange.\" \nAmazon estimates that its investments in Seattle from 2010 through 2016 resulted in an additional $38 billion to the city's economy. \nProposals for HQ2 were due last week. \nThe-CNN-Wire™&© 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Bill O'Reilly 'mad at God' over sexual misconduct allegations Posted: Updated: CNN Wire In this Oct. 1, 2015 file photo, Bill O'Reilly of the Fox News Channel program \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" poses for a photo on the set of his show in New York. O’Reilly’s next book “Old School: Life in the Sane Lane,\" is scheduled for release on Mar 28. (AP) \nBy Tom Kludt \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Bill O'Reilly has repeatedly blamed reports of sexual misconduct on a politically motivated media. On Monday, he admitted that he also blames a higher power. \n\"You know, am I mad at God? Yeah, I'm mad at him,\" O'Reilly said on the latest episode of his web series, \" No Spin News. \"\"I wish I had more protection. I wish this stuff didn't happen. I can't explain it to you. Yeah, I'm mad at him.\" \nHe then said that he derives perspective from the tribulations of others, including Kate Steinle, a woman who was allegedly shot by an undocumented immigrant who has been the subject of numerous O'Reilly commentaries. \nO'Reilly's response to allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior has been consistent. He's emphatically denied the claims, insisting that his wealth and fame make him a target for such accusations. And he's denounced the press that has reported on the allegations -- and the ensuing settlements -- as corrupt and desperate to take him down. \nBut O'Reilly's comments on his show Monday evening, which came after the New York Times reported on a $32 million settlement he reached with a former Fox News colleague who accused him of sexual misconduct, might have represented his most dramatic claim for victimhood yet. \n\"If I die tomorrow and I get an opportunity, I'll say, 'Why'd you guys work me over like that? Didn't [you] know my children were going to be punished? And they're innocent,'\" he said. \"But then I think about people who have it much, much rougher than me. And you know, I'm a big mouth. I'm a target. They're not targets.\" \nIn the days following the Times' bombshell, O'Reilly has used social media and sympathetic media platforms to clear his name. Earlier on Monday, he went on a radio show hosted by Glenn Beck, also a former Fox Newser, who vouched for O'Reilly's character. O'Reilly has also directed his followers on Twitter to visit his official website for evidence designed both to exonerate himself and discredit others. \nOn Monday night, O'Reilly defended himself once again on his website with the latest edition of \"No Spin News,\" which has served as his primary platform since he was ousted at Fox News in April. \nThe network sacked O'Reilly, who had reigned as the top-rated host on cable news for years, weeks after the Times reported on settlements that he, Fox News and the network's parent company 21st Century Fox -- together or separately -- had made with women who had accused him of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior. \nO'Reilly said Monday that the success of his web series and his latest book, \"Killing England,\" as well as a recent appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News program, prompted the Times to to declare, \"You know, we didn't kill him, so we've got to kill him again.\" \n\"So they came back with another bunch of garbage. I talked to them this time just to see the devil that I was dealing with,\" he said. \"And I truly believe that these people at the New York Times are out to hurt people with whom they disagree. They don't want me in the marketplace. That's what this is all about.\" \nO'Reilly said once again that he struck the settlements to protect his children, and that he wants the story \"to go away.\" He plans on defending himself, but only on friendly platforms like Beck's show. On Tuesday, O'Reilly said he'll talk to conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, who will debut in Fox News' primetime lineup next week. \nO'Reilly said he spoke to another Fox News personality, Sean Hannity, earlier on Monday. \n\"We're two Long Island guys, we've known each other for more than 20 years,\" O'Reilly said of Hannity. \"So I was talking to him and you know, I said, 'Look I don't want to go on a tour or on the morning shows. I don't want to do any of this. All right. All I want to do is present what we have, get people to look at what we have, and make up your mind. Make up your own mind about it. That's what I'm trying to do here.'\" \nTM &© 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved. Popular Stories",

      "text": "Editor's Notebook: Cajon Pass commuting isn't getting any easier Sunday Oct 22, 2017 at 12:01 AM Oct 23, 2017 at 8:29 AM Steve Hunt Editor Steve Hunt \nI’m going to put on my old Cajon Pass Commuter hat today, in part to cover my bald head and in part to commiserate with all my old buddies still making that dreadful drive down the hill. I know, it isn’t always a dreadful drive, but I’m guessing for a lot of you it is. \nI had not been forced to make that commute on a weekday for quite a while. It’s been nearly four years since I kissed the daily commute to West Covina goodbye and since then I’ve only had to head down the hill during the week on a few occasions, usually to go to LAX. \nWell, with a new job comes new responsibilities and one of them required me to be at the US Bank Building in downtown L.A. at 9 a.m. on a Wednesday morning. I had to go to downtown L.A. on a weekday several years ago, only I had to be there by 8 a.m. I left Hesperia at 5 a.m. and walked in the office at 7:58 a.m. \nI expected another three-hour drive this time, so I left at 6 a.m. I walked in the building a few minutes before 9 this time, but only because I paid $20 and change to use the FasTrak lanes from somewhere just west of Peck Road in El Monte all the way to Alameda Street in L.A. \nOverall, it was a brutal experience. It took me two hours to drive from Apple Valley to Interstate 10, and that was using every side street I thought would help me after I jumped off the 210 at Grand Avenue in Glendora. \nI learned a few things the hard way: \n• Interstate 15 is no picnic at 6 in the morning, at least not until you’re a little south of Highway 138; \n• The 210 is no picnic at 7 in the morning, especially after you are west of the 57; \n• There must be a million more people living in the San Gabriel Valley now than just four years ago, because every street I thought I could count on to cut time off my drive was jammed and really didn’t help me at all. I must have hit 100 stoplights (OK, maybe 2 dozen), but Gladstone, Arrow Highway and even Los Angeles Street were horrible. That didn’t used to be the case; \n• FasTrak is overpriced and half the time you’re in the FasTrak lanes you’re not moving any faster than the regular lanes, which is to say not at all. Where FasTrak did help me was right after I jumped into the lanes in El Monte, then after I got past Cal State Los Angeles. \n• L.A. needs double-decker freeways everywhere; \n• The dinosaurs left L.A. when they heard the freeways were coming; \n• You couldn’t pay me enough to make that drive every day. \nThe most sobering part of this whole experience was I didn’t run into one accident or anything else to cause a delay on the entire trip. I’m sure that would have added another 30 minutes to the drive. Rain would have added an extra hour. \nHonestly, I hope this was the last rush-hour trip to Los Angeles I will ever make. \nWith all due respect to Horace Greeley, I shall not be heading West again any time soon. \nI am no young man anymore, but I knew my future — at least as a commuter — can only be headed east or north. \nI hope the same will soon be true for all of you Cajon Pass Commuters. \nSteve Hunt can be reached at 760-951-6270 or by email at SHunt@VVDailyPress.com.

Unsplash/Fre Sonneveld \nIf you think the rent on your flat is expensive , prepare to learn how much your boss is forking out for your office cubicle. \nLondon-based estate agency Knight Frank has studied property values across 40 major cities for the Knight Frank \"2018 Global Cities\" report. \nThe report analyses how much prime office space can be bought for US$100 million (£76 million) in different cities in response to the growing trend of private investors who have traditionally invested in residential buildings now looking towards offices. \nDespite already-staggering rents in the world's biggest business hubs continuing to climb, the report discovered that investors and companies continue to focus on and invest in \"safe haven\" cities — such as London, Zurich, and Tokyo — long established as wealthy cities and business hubs, rather than branching into up-and-coming cities. \nAcross the capital cities listed, with $100 million (£76 million), investors can bag everything from half the area of Buckingham Palace and its grounds, to the spatial equivalent of just eight IMAX cinema screens. \nScroll on to discover the 16 capital cities and autonomous cities where you'll pay the most to rent an office, ranked in ascending order on how much office space $100 million would typically get. 16. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Unsplash/Pawel Szymankiewicz \nIn Malaysia's capital, $100 million (£76 million) will get you 512,385 square feet of office space, which covers 90% of Windsor Castle — the Queen's main residence. \n15. Manila, Philippines. Pixabay/TheDigitalWay \nFor $100 million (£76 million), a company or investor can buy 445,739 square feet of office space in Manila. This is half the size of Buckingham Palace and its grounds. 14. Bangkok, Thailand. Flickr/Thangaraj Kumaravel \nThe bustling capital city of Thailand is a favourite amongst travellers and businesspeople alike. In Bangkok, $100 million (£76 million) will buy you 229,244 square feet of office space — the equivalent of two city blocks in Manhattan, New York. 13. New Delhi, India. Flickr/Ed Johnson \nNew Delhi is the capital of India and one of Delhi city's 11 districts. Located in India's northern quarter, $100 million (£76 million) of office space can bag an investor 156,304 square feet — two and a half times as big as The White House. 12. Seoul, South Korea. Unsplash/Yonghyun Lee \n$100 million (£76 million) will bag you 140,608 square feet of office space in South Korea's capital — approximately the size of a Manhattan city block. 11. Washington D.C., USA. Unsplash/Alexey Topolyanskiy \n$100 million (£76 million) of office space in Washington, D.C. is equivalent to 30 basketball courts, or just one 15th of New York City's Grand Central Station. That's 135,602 square feet. 10. Madrid, Spain. Flickr/Felipe Gabaldon \n$100 million (£76 million) of office space in Madrid equivalates to 105,730 square feet on average. That's approximately twice the size of Bill Gates's family home in Medina, Washington. 9. Beijing, China. \nIn China's capital, $100 million (£76 million) will bag an investor 99,563 square feet of office space. That's one and three-quarter American football fields. 8. Amsterdam, Netherlands. Unsplash/Stijn te Strake \nAmsterdam has a reputation for being a favourite amongst tourists thanks to its thriving art, culture, and history circuits. The Dutch capital has a thriving business and property scene too, with $100 million (£76 million) of office real estate equivalating to 96,762 square feet on average — that's just one fifth the size of a Polo field. 7. Berlin, Germany. Unsplash/Fre Sonneveld \nCompetition for office space in Berlin has driven up prices, with investors only bagging 85,170 square feet on average for $100 million (£76 million) worth of space — that's five American league-approved hockey rinks and a 42% decrease year on year. 6. Dublin, Ireland. Flickr/Giuseppe Milo \nIn the Republic of Ireland's capital city, $100 million (£76 million) of office space will get companies and investors just 65,717 square feet of office space — the size of Washington D.C.'s White House. 5. Singapore. Unsplash/Lily Lvnatikk \nA bustling business scene in this city-island state has driven up office space prices, with $100 million (£76 million) of investment equivalating to 48,389 square feet of space — four times the size of Fort Knox, the US army post where most of the country's gold is retained. 4. London, UK. Unsplash, Rob Bye \nLondon is frequently heralded as one of the most economically powerful cities on earth , and so it's no surprise that demand for office space in the UK's capital has driven up prices. \nAs of this year, $100 million (£76 million) will get investors a mere 43,899 square feet of space. That's eight basketball courts, half the space that you'd get for the same amount of money in Berlin and a mere tenth of what you can get in Kuala Lumpur. 3. Paris, France. Unsplash/John Towner \nApartments and living spaces in the French capital are notoriously small, and so it's no surprise that demand for office space in Paris is equally high. For $100 million (£76 million), investors and companies can expect to get just 36,662 square feet on average — that would only cover 2% of Grand Central Station in New York City. 2. Tokyo, Japan. Unsplash/Steven Diaz \nAn incredible 38 million people are expected to occupy Japan's capital by 2030 , forecasting it to be the most populated city in the world within 15 years. As a result, demand for real estate — both commercial and residential — is off the charts. \n$100 million (£76 million) of office space will bag you just 31,282 square feet on average across the city. That's the equivalent to 11 tennis courts, or eight IMAX cinema screens. 1. Hong Kong. Unsplash/John O'Nolan \nDemand for office space in the autonomous state of Hong Kong has driven prices through the roof, making it the most expensive place in the world to buy and rent commercial space. \n$100 million (£76 million) equivalates to an average of only 11,698 square feet of space. That's ten times less than what investors can get for the same amount of money in Shanghai (115,657 square feet), or the spatial equivalent of less than a single floor of the Shard in London. \nBased on this figure, the average eight-foot by eight-foot office cubicle costs buyers over half a million US dollars ($547,102).",

Posted October 24, 2017 at 06:36 AM | Updated October 24, 2017 at 06:40 AM By Len Melisurgo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com IMG_2381.JPG \nNew Jerseyans could face a challenging commute to and from work on Tuesday, with heavy rain and strong thunderstorms expected to sweep through the region as a slow-moving cold front rumbles in from the Midwest and brings an end to the long stretch of dry weather. \nMore than 20,000 residents were already without power as of 6:30 a.m. from high wind overnight. \nAlthough severe weather is not usually welcome, this one could erase the sizable October rainfall deficit and help boost the region’s drinking water supplies. \nMost areas of New Jersey, New York City and eastern Pennsylvania have received very little rain this month, just off the heels of a fairly dry September. Newark's rainfall total this month is almost 2 inches below normal, and New York City is running a rainfall deficit of more than 2 inches, according to data from the National Weather Service . \nTuesday's rain storms, which could linger into Wednesday morning, are forecast to bring 1 to 2 inches of rain to most regions of New Jersey and 2 to 2.5 inches to New York City, with higher amounts possible in the strongest thunderstorms. Wind advisories and some early-morning power outages \nA wind advisory is in effect for all but the five northeastern counties (Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic and Union) on Tuesday morning. Winds out of the south of 10 to 20 mph could gust as high as 45 mph. The strongest winds are expected to occur before 9 a.m., the weather service said early Tuesday. \nAs of 6:15 a.m., Atlantic City Electric had more than 14,000 customers without power, primarily in Gloucester County. PSE&G had more than 4,000 customers without power. Most of those were in Burlington and Camden Counties. JCP&L (First Energy) reported nearly 1,200 residents without power with most of those in Burlington and Monmouth counties. rain-forecast-oct23-oct25-nj.jpg \nThis map shows the total rainfall projections for most of New Jersey and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic region through early Thursday afternoon.

      "text": "NEW YORK -- Martin Jones validated an old-hockey cliche Monday, serving as the Sharks best penalty killer on a night where his teammates couldn't stay out of the sin bin.\nJones stopped all 10 of the short-handed shots he faced against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, allowing the Sharks penalty kill to go 6-for-6 en route to a 4-1 win.\nWith a shutout against the New Jersey Devils on Friday, Jones put together a shutout streak of 133:46 before Mika Zibanejad beat him with a shot to the near post at 4:23 of the third.\nThe penalty kill is putting together an impressive streak of its own with 16-consecutive kills. In the aftermath of its 2-for-5 performance on opening night, the penalty kill is 30-for-31 (97.0 percent).\nJones, who blocked 33 of the 34 shots he faced, made a number of remarkable saves in the game. He stopped a Rick Nash redirection of a Zibanejad shot in the first. In the second, he stuck with David Desharnais, knocking down his shot with his glove after the Rangers center tried to pull him out of position from the doorstep.\nLater in the period, Jones slide across the crease to thwart a Chad Kreider one timer from the lower-left circle.\nJones wasn't the only Sharks (4-4) to stay aflame against the Rangers.\nLogan Couture, who was named the NHL's third star of the week after notching five goals and seven points in three games last week, opened the scoring at 1:56 of the first with his team-leading seventh goal, firing a puck past netminder Henrik Lundqvist on a delayed Rangers penalty.\n In doing so, Couture, who recorded his second-career hat trick against the New York Islanders Saturday, managed to score his fourth goal in a span of 35:30. Couture also set up the Sharks fourth goal at 2:51 of the third, stripping the puck from Lundqvist on a dump-and-chase play and feeding Melker Karlsson in front of the net.\nThe game also proved to be noteworthy for rookie defenseman Tim Heed, who picked up his first NHL goal at 12:48 of the first, squeaking the puck through Lundqvist's pads on an odd-angle shot from near the goal line.\nJoonas Donskoi notched the Sharks third goal on a partial breakaway at 19:22 of the second, zinging the puck inside the far post from the lower-left circle. Joe Thornton picked up an assist on the play, tying Jari Kurri for 20th place on the NHL's all-time scoring list with his 1,398th career point.\n(c)2017 The Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)\nVisit The Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.com",

More >>  31   This   \nBy MICHAEL BIESECKERAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the   Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips",

      "text": "President Trump jumped ahead of Republicans' long-planned tax reform maneuvering Monday with a morning tweet that ruled out a proposal under consideration to change the tax treatment of retirement savings.\nAt the moment, Republicans on the House and Senate committees responsible for taxes are supposed to be working out the tax reform details, after their leadership negotiated for months with the Trump administration over a broad framework. The White House has promised that it will be flexible regarding those details.\n\"Things that aren't agreed to in advance, they go into committee, and that's the process that starts\" this week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday on CBS.\nYet Trump dismissed the possibility of a major provision that Republicans might have used to raise revenues for the tax rate reductions he has called for.\nThe specific measure in question is regarded by some experts as a budgetary gimmick, rather than a serious policy change.\nRepublicans were considering lowering the limits on pre-tax contributions to 401(k)s, which are funds that are taxed when they are withdrawn in retirement. Instead, savers would be directed toward Roth IRA-style savings vehicles, in which funds are contributed on an after-tax basis, but then can be withdrawn tax-free upon retirement. Such a switch would make it appear that the government was raising more money in the 10-year timeframe Congress uses to assess the cost of legislation, even though over a long period time it might not make a difference.\nTrump's tweet aimed at cutting off the debate came just days after several reports that the switch was under serious consideration.\nThere will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017 \nJill Hoffman, a tax lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group, suggested that Trump's tweet was driven simply by a \"pretty organic response\" to the negative reaction to those reports.\n\"It sends a strong signal that anything that they do in the context of tax reform that could cut or change retirement savings ... is going to be problematic politically,\" said Hoffman, whose group represents financial firms that manage tax-privileged accounts.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer took advantage of the surprise comment from Trump to criticize the GOP tax reform effort. \"[T]he fact that Republicans were even considering raiding America's retirement savings to pay for a giant tax cut for corporations, states, shows just how backward their plan is,\" the New Yorker said in a statement.\nSchumer's Republican counterparts were more reserved about the impact of Trump's tweet.\n\"At least for right now, it's in everybody's best interest to keep their gunpowder dry and talk about kind of the high-level stuff and then let the committees get in and start working the details,\" said South Dakota's John Thune, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.\nThune noted that to assess the effect of ending any particular tax break, it's necessary to also see the corresponding benefits, such as lower rates, and assess the plan as a whole.\nNevertheless, he acknowledged, \"If that's something that's a non-negotiable for him, that'll probably shape the thinking of people up here.\"\nIn the early going, congressional Republicans have encountered predictable concerns from within their party about plans to eliminate popular breaks. Blue-state Republicans in the House, for instance, have raised the possibility of voting against a plan that cuts the state and local tax deduction, which disproportionately benefits their constituents.\nSome of the party's fiscal hawks are concerned that too many such revenue-raisers — or to regular people, the elimination of a tax break — might prove too politically difficult.\n\"I just don't hear anybody talking about that,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., talking about the need to raise trillions of dollars in eliminated tax breaks to pay for the tax reform package. \"I hear about tax cuts. But it doesn't work without the base-broadeners.\"\nNevertheless, at least one lawmaker stated that the plans for the tax package wouldn't be determined by Trump's Twitter intervention.\nRep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, declined to say whether he planned to lower maximum contributions to 401(k)s in the legislative text. But, asked by a reporter whether Trump's tweet would change what the committee will do, Brady simply responded, \"No.\"",

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.). President Donald Trump has expressed his frustrations with McCain for his \"no\" votes. \nWhen McCain voted \"no\" on the Graham-Cassidy bill last month, he said he did so because it was presented on a party-line basis. \n\"As I have repeatedly stressed, health care reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate,\" he said in a statement. \"Committees of jurisdiction should mark up legislation with input from all committee members, and send their bill to the floor for debate and amendment.\" \nREAD: Full statement from Sen.

      "text": "Republican-led probe finds Sound Transit deceived lawmakers, the public Heather Graf and Allison Sundell , KING 6:00 PM. PDT October 23, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nRepublican lawmakers say the results of a state Senate investigation into Sound Transit found that the agency misled lawmakers and the public while trying to pass a $54 billion transit package. But Democratic Senators who serve on the Law and Justice Committee that conducted the investigation say they don't agree with the findings released on Monday. \n“Sound Transit played fast and loose with the truth,” Sen. Mike Padden, Republican chair of the Senate Law and Justice Committee, said in a release. “It kept key facts from the Legislature and the voters. It displayed disregard for laws designed to ensure full disclosure and prevent public resources from being used for campaigns.” \nThe probe , led by Republican lawmakers, investigated whether Sound Transit deliberately hid the cost of the tax package known as Sound Transit 3, or ST3. \nRelated: Lawmakers hold second investigatory hearing into Sound Transit, ST3 \nThe ST3 measure approved by voters last November will pay to expand mass transit in King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties. \nThe state Senate Law and Justice Committee found that the agency concealed the true cost of the ST3 measure, by going to the public with a larger tax package than originally pitched to the legislature. In 2015, Sound Transit proposed a tax package that would generate $15 billion over 15 years. However, the ST3 measure called for a much larger package that covered 25 years of new revenue. \nThe investigation also found Sound Transit improperly used public resources to promote a third-party campaign for a ballot measure. \nThe committee asked lawmakers to consider legislation to give taxpayers substantial tax relief and restrict agency campaign activities, such as advertising budget and lobbying. It also advised potential campaign violations be referred to a prosecutor’s office. \nSound Transit called the investigation a “highly partisan endeavor” that “perpetuates fictions” about ST3. \n“The committee’s final report is a sham that the minority members did not even have a chance to review before its release,” Sound Transit spokesperson Geoff Patrick said in a statement. \nRelated: Memo to Sound Transit Board on Senate work sessions \nSens. Jamie Pedersen and David Frockt, both Seattle Democrats who serve on the committee, said they did not know the Republican-led committee would be releasing the investigation findings on Monday. \n\"Absolutely not. And these aren't even the findings of the committee, because for it to be a committee report, we'd have to have had hearings where we had a draft report to consider and an opportunity for minority members to make comments or draft a minority report, and we haven't had any of that process,\" said Pedersen. \"This is purely a political effort by the Senate Republicans.\" \nPedersen said that after sitting through hours of testimony during the Law and Justice Committee's investigation, he does not believe that Sound Transit misled lawmakers or the public. \n\"Frankly, I think there was not a lot of evidence to support the allegations,\" he said. \"I think this investigation was a waste of taxpayer money. \n© 2017 KING-TV",

      "text": "Study: Climate change costs taxpayers billions By MICHAEL BIESECKER Associated Press 11:13 pm \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades. \nA Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history. \nThe report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as \"high risk.\" \n\"The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,\" the study said. \"By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.\" \nGAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n\"This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,\" said Collins. \"In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.\" \nThe report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs. \nThe report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves. \nAdvance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report. \nRequests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming. \nEarlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with \"vastly improved living conditions across the world\" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to \"the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.\" \nWhite, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature. \n___ \nFollow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck \n___ \nSubmit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips Related Links",

      "text": "Trump shoots down cuts to retirement limit By MARCY GORDON Associated Press 11:15 pm Caption Donald Trump \nWASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump shot down a possible approach for raising revenue to finance tax cuts in politically must-do legislation for the Republicans, promising Monday the popular 401(k) retirement program will be untouched. \nStill, the head of the House’s tax-writing committee indicated that changes to the 401(k) structure may still be on the table as Republicans push an ambitious timetable to get tax legislation written. Asked about the issue, Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Kevin Brady said: “I don’t want to get ahead of the committee. That will all be part of the tax reform bill.” \nAnd in response to whether Trump’s tweet changes in any way what the panel was planning to do, Brady replied only, “no.” \nRepublicans are scrambling to find new revenue sources to pay for anticipated tax cuts exceeding $1 trillion. A proposal to eliminate the widely used federal deduction for state and local taxes has run into heavy opposition from GOP House members from high-tax states, threatening the enactment of tax legislation that Republicans deem essential to retaining their majority in next year’s elections. \nTrump pledged in a tweet there will be “no change” to tax incentives for the 401(k) retirement programs. \nThe plan crafted by Trump and Republican leaders calls for steep tax cuts for corporations and potentially individuals, a doubling of the standard deduction used by most Americans, shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, and the repeal of inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. The child tax credit would be increased and the tax system would be simplified; most Americans would be able to file their income taxes on a postcard, according to the plan. \nCrucial details of the plan have yet to be worked out, notably what income levels would fit with each tax bracket. \nWith the possibility of the state and local deduction being at least partly preserved, some Republican lawmakers were considering limiting the amount workers could save in 401(k) retirement accounts. \n“It was a trial balloon and it crashed,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. “They’re struggling to find legitimate offsets” for tax cuts. \n“Everyone has been promised they are going to be better off with tax reform and that’s really hard to do in a fiscally responsible way,” Riedl said. \nEmployees’ earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren’t taxed until retirement; pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-preferred status. That cost the government $82.7 billion in lost revenue in the recent budget year ending Sept. 30, 2016 – a potentially juicy target for Republican tax-cutters. \nWith 55 million U.S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class. \n“This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!” Trump tweeted. “There will be NO change to your 401(k).” \nAppearing with Ivanka Trump in Pennsylvania, U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza echoed the president, telling the audience the retirement plans “will not be touched.” \nRep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the Trump-rejected proposal on retirement plans: “There are still some dials that do have to be turned. This is a major effort and when you dial one thing you have to look at another.” \nHouse Republicans will be working to pass a budget this week so they can turn their attention to the tax overhaul. Trump warned Sunday that action on tax reform is crucial to avoiding political failure in 2018. He’ll work to rally support for the plan at the Capitol today. \nTrump personally implored House GOP members on a conference call to swiftly adopt the budget that was passed last week by the Senate, with the hope of clearing the way for what he described as historic tax cuts. \nTrump told the lawmakers they were on the verge of doing something historic, according to one Republican official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what was intended as a private update for members. \nAnother GOP aide familiar with the conversation said Trump told the members again and again that the party would pay a steep price in next year’s midterm elections if it failed to pass his plan. \nThe Senate last week passed a budget plan that includes rules that will allow Republicans to get tax legislation through the Senate without Democratic votes or fear of a Democratic filibuster. House Republicans signaled Friday they would simply accept the Senate plan to avoid any potential delay on the tax measure. \nRepublicans are desperate to rack up a legislative win after a series of embarrassing failures despite the party controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. Topping the list: their stalled attempts to pass legislation repealing and replacing “Obamacare.” If tax overhaul legislation doesn’t pass, many in the party fear a complete rout in 2018. \n___ \nAP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and AP writers Jill Colvin, Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.

      "text": "Trump is attending the weekly Senate Republican lunch Tuesday in an attempt to gather support for a tax reform bill that has yet to be released. He’ll be in a closed-door lunch where many in the room are those he’s publicly attacked, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump has also feuded with, called the visit “a photo op.”\n“Tomorrow’s a photo op, nothing more nothing less. To read anything more into it would be spending a lot of time on something that shouldn’t be spent a lot of time on,” Corker said. “It’s going to be up and down for the next three years and that’s just the way it’s going to be. I don’t read anything into tomorrow other than a photo op.”\nSome Republicans on the Hill are skeptical of Trump’s party loyalty after instances where he openly attacked elected Republicans and members of the party's congressional leadership. His former top adviser, Steve Bannon, has declared an all-out “war” with the GOP establishment, vowing to run a primary candidate against nearly every sitting Senate Republican up for re-election in 2018.\nRepublicans are entering into a critical phase in their effort to pass tax reform. Some conservative members are going out on a limb, breaking their campaign promise and their principled stance of opposing any legislation that would add to the deficit in order to advance tax reform.\n“Am I feeling the pressure to get this done? Yes. Have I been willing to negotiate a little more generously because of that pressure? Yeah. That’s just shooting straight with you,” said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\nThe Senate passed their budget last week, a critical step in moving forward on tax legislation. The House is taking up the Senate’s budget this week, even though it adds to the deficit.\nHouse Republicans plan to move quickly on tax reform. They expect to unveil legislation within the next two weeks with a goal of passing it before Thanksgiving. But the Senate is likely to move more slowly, hoping to pass their bill before Christmas.\nTrump told House Republicans that the Senate needs to move more quickly because the longer they wait the more time people have to change their minds.\nWhile Trump urges party unity, he and his team have yet to reach out to two critical members of the Senate on the issue. Both Sens. McCain and Susan Collins, R-Maine, say that they have yet to speak with Trump or White House aides about tax reform.\nPlay\nFacebook Twitter Embed Bannon Explains Trump's America First Approach as 'Jacksonian' 2:51 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog “I had early on (had a meeting) with members of the president’s economic council but mainly I’ve been talking about my colleagues about it,” Collins said.\nWhile Trump impressed his Republican credentials in the call to House Republicans, he also knocked McCain, without naming him, for not voting for health care. And he told them that he’ll work to get the support of four Democrats from states that he won by 20 or 30 points.\nWhite House aides and the president have been heavily courting Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, all Democrats who are from states that Trump won and are up for reelection in 2018.\nAll three joined Trump at rallies in their respective states in recent months and attended meetings at the White House. Heitkamp and Manchin attended a bipartisan dinner at Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s house with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n“You keep asking us if we’re going to support it. I don’t know what ‘it’ is,” Heitkamp said of the unreleased bill.\nTrump warned Republicans that the 2018 elections will be a “bloodbath” if they don’t pass tax reform.",

      "text": "The suite of codes, statements and laws governing lobbying are failing Australian voters. Yet, for decades, the two major parties have been unwilling to meaningfully improve them.\nBut, having recognised the seriousness of the problems with lobbying and corruption in Australia, the Senate crossbenchers – along with lower house independents – have finally begun the process of deciding how lobbying reform should occur.\nInto this space, the Jacqui Lambie Network has released a policy that has become the starting point for negotiations on one of Australia’s most important policy challenges.\nA ‘federal ICAC’? Labor and the trade unions have signalled a willingness to tackle lobbying at some point. However, there are meaningful obstacles to the crossbench’s current plan.\nGiven its control of the lower house, the Coalition would need to be brought on side for legislation to pass anytime soon. However, citing Australia’s performance on Transparency International’s corruption index, Attorney-General George Brandis is against a federal regulator to police anti-corruption.\nSimilarly, the Institute of Public Affairs – a Liberal Party ideological ally – rejects the idea because such an agency might abuse its power .\nHowever, the crossbench has been more impressed by New South Wales’ Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), where the true “abuses of power” have been those uncovered by the commission .\nEnter the crossbench Given the resistance from the Coalition, hope for changes to lobbying laws currently rest with the Senate crossbench and the lower house independents. They are negotiating a unified policy based on Lambie’s proposal.\nThe policy acknowledges that new lobbying laws need to be legislated; have meaningful enforcement provisions (including the possibility of fines or imprisonment for serious offences; and have an independent regulator to oversee them.\nHaving an independent regulator is critical. As it stands, when a minister leaves office, their eligibility to work as a lobbyist, and whether they have breached any lobbying regulations, is determined by those who directly work with – or for – the prime minister.\nThe problems of the revolving door are significant, and growing . It is now commonplace for former ministers to go on to work for companies directly related to their former portfolios – be it on their boards or as lobbyists.\nFurther reading: The revolving door: why politicians become lobbyists, and lobbyists become politicians\nThis creates a clear conflict of interest for those ministers when they are in power. Their decisions while in power have the potential to affect the possibility of a job when they leave office. It also allows them far greater access to, and creates conflicts of interest for, the government decision-makers they meet. These are people they often worked with, for, or above.\nAs a result, Lambie’s plan would ban ministers and senior public servants from taking up lobbying positions within five years of leaving office. This is increased from the current, poorly-enforced 18-month ban.\nThis move would bring Australia’s prohibition on post-separation employment in line with Canada and the US . Extending the exemption period of post-separation employment, and having an independent regulator to oversee it, would mean the potential for the aforementioned conflicts of interest and advantageous access are reduced.\nBeyond the revolving door provisions, Lambie’s plan centres around the ideal of “levelling the playing field” for interest groups. This in turn is based on the problems that arise when some get better access than others .\nAs such, Lambie’s plan borrows heavily from the overseas examples . It calls for more transparency in lobbying, incentives to join a register of lobbyists, and expanding the definition of “lobbyists” to include those who operate in-house (Australia’s register currently only captures third-party lobbyists).",

      "text": "World UK lawmakers ask Facebook for any evidence of Russian-linked Brexit activity FILE PHOTO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the Facebook F8 conference in San Francisco. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 6:35   \nLONDON - A British parliamentary committee has written to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg asking for information on any paid-for activity by Russian-linked Facebook accounts around the 2016 EU referendum and the 2017 UK election. \nThe request was made by Damian Collins, chair of parliament's Digital, Media and Sport Committee as part of its effort to gather evidence for an inquiry it is conducting into fake news. \n\"Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations,\" Collins wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg circulated to media by the committee. \nHe asked Facebook to provide examples of all adverts bought by Russian-linked accounts, of all pages set up by Russian-linked accounts, information on the targeting of such adverts and pages and how many times they were viewed. \n\"I believe that the information I have requested is in line with that already supplied to Facebook to several United States Senate Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\" wrote Collins. \nThe committee of British lawmakers launched its inquiry into fake news in January but it was suspended when a general election was called for June. The closing date for submitting evidence is Nov. 7. \nThe inquiry aims to shed light on issues such as the impact of fake news on public understanding of the world and response to traditional journalism, the responsibilities of social media platforms and how people can be educated to assess news sources. \nThe issue of whether and how much Russia intervened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a huge issue in Washington, where it is the subject of multiple investigations. \nFacebook said on Oct. 2 that some 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on its network that were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the presidential election. \nIn Britain, interest in whether Russia also played a part in domestic political processes such as the June 2016 referendum on withdrawing from the European Union and the June 2017 general election has been increasing in recent weeks. \nLast week, another member of parliament, Ben Bradshaw, called on the government to get to the bottom of reports of opaque funding sources for some elements of the pro-Brexit campaign, citing \"widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference\". \nRussia has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

      "text": "Tweet Share \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Election Day is just a hair over two weeks away in St. Petersburg, and polls suggest the race between former Mayor Rick Baker and current Mayor Rick Baker is still about as close as it gets . \nAnd though it's ostensibly a nonpartisan affair, party involvement has been big for both candidates — Baker has had financial assistance from many a fellow Republican, while before the primary Kriseman landed an endorsement from none other than Barack Obama (and plenty of other high-profile Dems). \nObservers on both sides see this election as something of a litmus on Trumpism; whether a categorically unpopular president may motivate people to turn out in an election in which they may normally not — or if enough of the city's Democrats will overlook party affiliation and support Baker. \nOn Friday, a Dem that's somewhat high-profile at the national level is coming to town to help drive home Kriseman's Democratic cred. \nJulian Castro, who served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Obama from 2014 through the end of the president's second term, will participate in a roundtable with Kriseman and others at the Station House in downtown St. Petersburg. The public is invited but space is limited and, presuming you go with the suggested donation and don't apply decimals in the quantity field, tickets aren't cheap. \nA former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Castro was on the short list of potential running mates for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Of course, it was Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine who won that honor, ultimately, but the inclusion of his name underscores his status as a rising star in national politics. \nCastro's visit, meanwhile, underscores how close the race is despite St. Petersburg's large Democratic and progressive presence. This may be attributed to Baker's longtime alliances with some key members of St. Petersburg's African American community, which date back to his first administration, a time when party involvement in nonpartisan political races was less of a thing — and there was less outside money funding attack ads that work to steer the narrative in one direction or another (namely, spinning of St. Pete's decades-in-the-making infrastructure woes vs. whether Baker is in line with Donald Trump's agenda, something even the Tampa Bay Times , a key media ally of his, has pointed out ). \nBaker has said repeatedly that party affiliation is not relevant in municipal governance, where playgrounds and potholes see neither red nor blue. Kriseman heartily begs to differ. \nKriseman insists that one belongs to a political party because its values align with his or her own values; that belonging to a party that prioritizes tackling climate change and having a more compassionate approach to immigration or healthcare signals one's character — as does belonging to one that elects someone who jokes or brags about assaulting women solely because said braggart wants to lower taxes, abolish regulations and reduce access to healthcare. \nIt's unclear what kind of a dent Kriseman's Democratic espousal will make in the general election (he unexpectedly bested Baker by 70 votes in the primary). Mail ballots are out and early voting begins this weekend. \nCastro and Kriseman, meanwhile, will be at Station House Friday, Oct. 27 at 10:30 a.m.",

(AP) — A top Republican political consultant and several current and former state representatives are expected in court on charges related to a corruption scheme in South Carolina’s Legislature. \nProsecutor David Pascoe says a bond hearing is scheduled Tuesday afternoon for Richard Quinn on charges of criminal conspiracy and failure to register as a lobbyist. Former Reps. Tracy Edge of North Myrtle Beach and Jim Harrison of Columbia face several charges, including criminal conspiracy and misconduct. \nRep. Rick Quinn, the elder Quinn’s son, was charged with criminal conspiracy. Sen. John Courson of Columbia was charged with statutory misconduct in office. Both men already faced other misconduct charges. \nRichard Quinn is a longtime political consultant who has advised some of South Carolina’s top Republicans. State police agents raided his Columbia office in March. Most Read Stories",

Bob Corker says the White House should \"step aside\" and let Congress' tax-writing committees figure out how to pay for the $1 trillion tax cut President Donald Trump wants to sign by the end of the year. \nThe Tennessee Republican tells NBC's \"Today\" Tuesday that the tough, \"spinach part\" of the process is looming and suggests that recent White House decisions to take proposals off the table aren't helping. On Monday, Trump ruled out changes to popular 401(k) retirement plans to help pay for the tax cut. \nCorker, who has announced plans to retire and has been critical of Trump, says he hopes the White House will let the committees do their work in a \"normal process.\" \nTrump heads to the Capitol on Tuesday to join Senate Republican lawmakers at their weekly policy luncheon. \nOn another topic, Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations chair, says Trump's tweets and heated rhetoric on North Korea have raised tensions and undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's diplomacy. \"When you kneecap that effort,\" Corker says, \"you really move our country into a binary choice, which could lead to a world war.\" \n__ \n3:40 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump is planning lunch with GOP senators on Capitol Hill as congressional Republicans turn their focus to overhauling the tax code. \nIt's to be Trump's first appearance as president at the Senate Republicans' regular Tuesday policy lunch. It comes as Trump has sparred with GOP senators such as John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, as well as with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — though McConnell and Trump had a joint press conference last week to try to smooth things over. \nSo the lunch has potential for awkward moments. Nonetheless, Republicans and the Trump administration are determined to get tax legislation into law this year, and all sides seem to think they can unite around that goal.",

      "text": "Senators push bill requiring warrant for U.S. data under spy law Tuesday, October 24, 2017 6:04 a.m. EDT Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) speaks with Reuters during an interview in Washington, U.S., May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nBy Dustin Volz \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of at least 10 U.S. senators plans to introduce on Tuesday legislation that would substantially reform aspects of the National Security Agency's warrantless internet surveillance program, according to congressional aides. \nThe effort, led by Democrat Ron Wyden and Republican Rand Paul, would require a warrant for queries of data belonging to any American collected under the program. The bill's introduction is likely to add uncertainty to how Congress will renew a controversial portion of a spying law due to expire on Dec. 31. \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is considered by U.S. intelligence officials to be among their most vital tools used to combat national and cyber security threats and help protect American allies. \nIt allows U.S. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States. \nThe surveillance program, classified details of which were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also incidentally scoops up communications of Americans, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas. \nThose communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a practice that the USA Rights Act authored by Wyden and Paul would end. \nThe measure is expected to be introduced with support from a wide berth of civil society groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and FreedomWorks, a Wyden spokesman said. \nIt would renew Section 702 for four years with additional transparency and oversight provisions, such as allowing individuals to more easily raise legal challenges against the law and expand the oversight jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government privacy watchdog. \nA bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives earlier this month introduced legislation seeking to add privacy protections to Section 702, including a partial restriction to the FBI's ability to access U.S. data when seeking evidence of a crime. \nBut that was criticized by privacy groups as too narrow. \nSeparately, the Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to privately vote on Tuesday on a bill to reauthorize Section 702 that privacy advocates say will lack their reform priorities. \nWyden sent a letter on Monday urging committee leaders to allow a public vote, saying the bill \"will have enormous impact on the security, liberty, and constitutional rights of the American people\" and should be debated in the open. \n(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Leslie Adler) More From Politics",

      "text": "Senators push bill requiring warrant for U.S. data under spy law Tuesday, October 24, 2017 5:04 a.m. CDT Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) speaks with Reuters during an interview in Washington, U.S., May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nBy Dustin Volz \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of at least 10 U.S. senators plans to introduce on Tuesday legislation that would substantially reform aspects of the National Security Agency's warrantless internet surveillance program, according to congressional aides. \nThe effort, led by Democrat Ron Wyden and Republican Rand Paul, would require a warrant for queries of data belonging to any American collected under the program. The bill's introduction is likely to add uncertainty to how Congress will renew a controversial portion of a spying law due to expire on Dec. 31. \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is considered by U.S. intelligence officials to be among their most vital tools used to combat national and cyber security threats and help protect American allies. \nIt allows U.S. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States. \nThe surveillance program, classified details of which were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also incidentally scoops up communications of Americans, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas. \nThose communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a practice that the USA Rights Act authored by Wyden and Paul would end. \nThe measure is expected to be introduced with support from a wide berth of civil society groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and FreedomWorks, a Wyden spokesman said. \nIt would renew Section 702 for four years with additional transparency and oversight provisions, such as allowing individuals to more easily raise legal challenges against the law and expand the oversight jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government privacy watchdog. \nA bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives earlier this month introduced legislation seeking to add privacy protections to Section 702, including a partial restriction to the FBI's ability to access U.S. data when seeking evidence of a crime. \nBut that was criticized by privacy groups as too narrow. \nSeparately, the Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to privately vote on Tuesday on a bill to reauthorize Section 702 that privacy advocates say will lack their reform priorities. \nWyden sent a letter on Monday urging committee leaders to allow a public vote, saying the bill \"will have enormous impact on the security, liberty, and constitutional rights of the American people\" and should be debated in the open. \n(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Leslie Adler) More From Politics",

      "text": "— Jason Calvi (@JasonCalvi) October 19, 2017 Upon its unveiling last week, the health insurance “stabilization” measure drafted by Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-WA) received praise from some lawmakers. For instance, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) stated that “health care reform ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate, and the bill [the sponsors] introduced today is an important step towards that end.”Unfortunately, the process to date has not resembled the “regular order” its sponsors have claimed. Drafted behind closed doors, by staff for a committee with only partial jurisdiction over health care, the bill’s provisions remained in flux as of last week. Moreover, the bill apparently will not undergo a mark-up or other committee action before the bill is either considered on the Senate floor—or, as some have speculated, “air-dropped” into a massive catch-all spending bill, where it will receive little to no legislative scrutiny. Questions - Process - Concerns - Proposal Four questions help clarify the process concerns regarding the Alexander-Murray proposal.Why didn’t Alexander know his bill provided taxpayer funding of abortion coverage? Article - Week - Reduction - Payments - Legislation Following my article last week highlighting how the cost-sharing reduction payments appropriated in the legislation would represent taxpayer funding of plans that cover abortion, a reporter for the Catholic-run Eternal Word Television Network interviewed senators Alexander and Murray (along with myself) about the issue.Alexander told reporter Jason Calvi that he “hadn’t discussed” the life issue with staff, indicating he had little inkling of the effects of the legislation he sponsored: Alexander - President - Abortion - Funding - Issue Alexander then claimed that “I’m sure the president will address” the abortion funding issue. But executive action—which a future president can always rescind—is no substitute for legislative language. The pro-life community derided President Obama’s executive order designed to segregate abortion payments and federal funding as an accounting sham.As I wrote in June, Republican leaders—including Senate leader Mitch McConnell...
