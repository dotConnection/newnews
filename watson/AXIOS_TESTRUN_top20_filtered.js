Suk Hoon Cho (20th), Namyong Lee (43th) and Inwoo Seo (55th) scored for South Korea. \nThe Koreans, unlike their previous Super 4s matches, were not at their usual defensive best and Pakistan took complete advantage of that as they attacked from hooter to hooter, showcasing exemplary skill to make space in the Korean circle, reports IANS. \nIt was Ahmad who was the hero of Pakistan’s victory as he pumped in three splendid goals. Each of his goals was a sheer thrill to watch. \nThe first one came as early as the 10th minute while the second and third showed his ability to skillfully dribble past Korean defenders. \nA long pass from skipper Muhammad Irfan to Ajaz in the 25-yard mark saw him swiftly make his way into the circle, not being hassled about the two Korean defenders attempting to tackle him. He gave no room for error as he fiercely pushed one past goalkeeper Doopyo Hong to help Pakistan take a 3-1 lead. \nOnly four minutes earlier, Rashid Mehmood had scored a field goal to give Pakistan a 2-1 lead. Ajaz’s third goal came in the 36th minute when he single-handedly maneuvered covering the 25-yard and drove into the striking circle with impeccable control of the ball, stepped away from his man Mookyoung Lee to push one into the post. \nThough South Korea scored two goals via Suk Hoon Cho and Namyong Lee, it did little to dent Pakistan’s hopes of a win. \nThe Koreans missed out on two back-to-back penalty corners in the final quarter but finally converted one with an improvised set piece that saw Inwoo Seo in the 55th minute to narrow the lead to 3-5.

      "text": "0 82 \nISLAMABAD: Never in the country’s history has Pakistan faced a worse crisis than the one it faces today, former PML-N leader Javed Hashmi said in a characteristically well-timed press conference on Monday. \nThe press conference was called by him to share insights on Pakistan’s political and constitutional struggles, his own struggles for democracy and his brief stint with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).“This is a land that works without a constitution,” Hashmi said at the start of the presser hosted in Islamabad. Criticising the manner in which the 1956 and 1973 constitutions were formulated, he said the “civil and military powers alter the constitution at will”. He added that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto ran the country into a state of emergency.“Then came Ziaul Haq, who himself was the constitution,” he said.“We could not become a nation which respects its constitution,” he said, claiming that the country has never seen a worse crisis in its 70-year history than the one it sees today. Talking about the role of the Supreme Court, Hashmi said: “The Supreme Court has caused more destruction in the country than any other institution.” He alleged that the court had allowed former president and military dictator Pervez Musharraf to change the constitution, although he had “broken” the Constitution twice. However, he clarified that he was not criticising incumbent Supreme Court justices. “I know that if I say anything about the current SC, it will amount to contempt of court,” he noted. “The current chief justice [of Pakistan] publicly kissed my hand, how can I say something against him?” Hashmi asked. He said many SC judges swore to get plots but again clarified that he was not talking about the current judges, who he said, were saints. SHARE",

It had also told the apex court that it has an offer worth Rs 2,500 crore from a company.\"Jaiprakash Associates wants to sell off the Yamuna Expressway and deposit the money in an escrow account, a proposal which was opposed by us in the court today,\" said advocate Ashwarya Sinha, who represented the first petitioners in the case.The company also sought to give to the court the proposal to hive off the Yumuna Expressway and informing about the proposed buyer, etc, in a sealed cover.The application filed by Jaiprakash Associates and its attempt to give the proposal in a sealed cover were opposed by the Attorney General, who stared that any proposal which affected so many people could not be given in a sealed cover, according to Sinha.The Supreme Court on September 11 had asked Jaiprakash Associates to deposit Rs 2,000 crore by October 27 to pay off the aggrieved home buyers.About 32,000 home buyers were left in the lurch after the Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) on August 9 classified Jaypee Infratech , a subsidiary of Jaiprakash Associates, as insolvent on the petition filed by IDBI Bank under Section 7 of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. Jaypee had defaulted on a Rs 526-crore loan by the bank.However, the Supreme Court on September 4 stayed insolvency resolution proceedings against Jaypee Infratech on a plea by home buyers of its projects in Noida. IDBI Bank on September 5 moved the apex court demanding the stay order to be vacated.The apex court on September 11 re-initiated the insolvency resolution proceedings against Jaypee Infratech and gave its management control to the IRP, appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal, with immediate effect.The apex court has also asked the professional to submit an interim plan to SC within 45 days keeping in view the interest of homebuyers.

      "text": "US needs to work with others on North Korea crisis: PM Lee US needs to work with others on North Korea crisis: PM Lee By - October 24, 2017 US President Donald Trump and Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong deliver joint statements to reporters in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, October 23, 2017. Reuters \nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for President Donald Trump his country’s efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program but also advised the US leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict. \n“There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary, but so is dialogue,” Lee said in remarks with Trump at the White House. “The US will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia, to resolve the issue.” \nHe urged Trump to build a good relationship with China, noting that Singapore and other countries in the region “watch your relations with China very closely” and see it as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world.” \nA senior White House official also said US President Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure North Korea when he visits China next month, stepping up a strategy to have Beijing help rein in Pyongyang. \nIsolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. \nTrump will call on Xi to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea. \nChina, North Korea’s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. \nChina has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. \nBut a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump’s trip said China needs to do more to comply with two U.N. Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China’s support. \n“We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those U.N. Security Council resolutions,” the official said. \nThough China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. \nChina’s special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his US counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said, where they had a “deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue”. The ministry did not elaborate. \nTrump, who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nBut this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan. \n‘CRITICAL’ THREAT \nThe threat from North Korea has grown to a “critical and imminent level” and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his US and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday. \nOnodera’s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. \nThe White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff. \nAsked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a US envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said: “There’s nothing planned.” \nWith Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week. \nTrump’s Nov. 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. \nTrump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the US trade deficit with China, the White House official said. \n“We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,” the official said. \nDespite Trump’s fierce criticism of China’s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea. \nChina has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbor. \nEven as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to US demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang.

[Special coverage] \nFrom the exquisite torch used at the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics to the fancy cycling helmets painted with Peking opera masks worn by Chinese track cyclists at the 2016 Rio Olympics, items on display at an exhibition in Beijing on Monday triggered oohs and ahhs from visitors flocking to the show to review China's social and economic achievements over the past five years. \nSome high-profile athletes attended the show at the Beijing Exhibition Hall, recalling their own highlight moments while learning about the progress their country achieved in other fields. \n\"I feel really thrilled to learn how much our country has developed in so many areas, not only in sports, with such a concrete presentation of items, illustrations and models,\" said Dong Dong, China's Olympic and world champion trampoline athlete. \"The sense of national pride just encourages you to work harder in whatever you do individually.\" \nDong was among a whopping 1,000 members of a sports delegation who visited the exhibition, Five Years of Sheer Endeavor, on Monday. It opened on Sept 25. \nThe country's State-run sports system deserves credit for the momentum of scientific innovation that has brought a technology-centered approach to sports development at both the elite and grassroots levels, Dong said. \n\"The progress in our talent-development system, which now combines all relevant sciences, is really remarkable,\" the 28-year-old veteran said. \nWorld champion table tennis star Fan Zhendong said the inspiration he felt at the exhibit was a morale boost that will help him win more titles and actively promote sports off the stage. \n\"Since the top leadership in our country attaches so much importance to sports development, we as front-runners in the business need to shoulder more responsibility for spreading the positive energy of sports participation to the public,\" said Fan, who won his first world title when he was 17 years old in May 2014. He was one of China's youngest athletes to do so. \nAmong the sports delegates was the new coach of the Chinese women's national handball team, Jesper Holmris of Denmark, who was enthusiastic about many of the exhibits. \"It's interesting to be here to see how fast the development has been going on in China, which is amazing,\" said Holmris, who last visited China 20 years ago. \n\"This is like a team-building experience for us, coming from Scandinavian culture to learn about what's going on in general in China. It will help us better understand the culture and do our job in sports,\" he said. Related news",

      "text": "8 \nAsian Shares Hover Near Recent Highs – NDTV Profit Sydney : Asian shares held within striking distance of recent decade highs on Tuesday even as Wall Street fell from record levels, while currencies kept to narrow ranges ahead of key economic events. Investors are closely watching China and the 19th Communist Party Congress, which winds up on Tuesday and at which President Xi Jinping is expected to release the composition of the Standing Committee – the apex of power in the country.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.1 per cent firmer at 549.71 points, not far from a 10-year high of 554.63 set last week. \nAustralian shares also edged higher and back toward a five-and-a-half-month peak touched on Monday, while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.2 per cent from a 21-year high. \n“Despite a lack of any real movement in markets, we know there are landmines and event risk to work through and this creates opportunity for short-term traders,” said Chris Weston, chief strategist at IG Markets. \n“Whether the gains can continue this week is obviously yet to be seen. I remain a bull, but of the view that these markets are tired, fatigued and need new information to fuel the beast.” \nIn the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.23 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 0.40 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.64 per cent. \nCorporate results will dominate near-term sentiment with earnings from General Motor, McDonald’s, and Lockheed Martin due later in the day. \nEuropean STOXX 600 shares rose 0.16 per cent, although Madrid’s bourse IBEX shed 0.6 per cent as Spain’s crisis entered another week. \nMadrid took the unprecedented step of firing the government of Catalonia on Saturday in a last resort to thwart its push for independence. Catalan leaders called for civil disobedience in response. \nIn Germany, the Alternative (AfD) party is set to clash with other parties over its nomination for a senior parliamentary post when the Bundestag meets on Tuesday. \nThe political tensions have weighed on the euro which hovered near two-week lows at $1.1752. The market is on edge ahead of a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday where it is expected to announce some form of policy tapering. \nInvestors were also biting their nails as suspense builds over who might be the next chair of Federal Reserve after Janet Yellen’s term expires in February. \nUS President Donald Trump has indicated an announcement is expected “very shortly”. \nThe market is betting on Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the likely choice while Mr Trump is also weighing on Stanford University economist John Taylor and current Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. \nThe dollar index inched lower to 93.8 but stayed in sight of a recent two-month peak. \nThe New Zealand dollar rose 0.2 per cent from near five-month lows with investors focused on any policy tidbits out of the country’s new Labour government. \nIn commodities, spot gold was mostly unchanged at $1282.26 an ounce. \nOil prices were little changed as supply disruptions in Iraq dented exports by OPEC’s second-largest producer and US drilling rates showed a slowdown. \nBrent crude added 6 cents to $57.43, while US crude rose 3 cents to $51.93 a barrel. © Thomson Reuters 2017",

      "text": "* Spotlight on little-known counterterrorism operation\n* Dunford: No initial signs soldiers took too many risks\n* McCain: Formal hearing expected Thursday (Adds more from news conference, background, McCain comment)\nBy Idrees Ali\nWASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer sought on Monday to tamp down criticism the Pentagon had not been forthcoming about the death of four U.S. soldiers in an ambush in Niger, providing a timeline of the incident and acknowledging unanswered questions remained.\nGeneral Joseph Dunford, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the United States Africa Command was conducting an investigation into the Oct. 4 attack. Some lawmakers have criticized the Pentagon for being slow to provide answers.\nDunford acknowledged that a number of issues were still under investigation, including why U.S. forces on the ground waited an hour until they called for support, what type of intelligence was used in the mission and why it took as long as it did to recover a U.S. soldier's body.\n\"There has been a lot of speculation about the operation in Niger and there's a perception that the Department of Defense has not been forthcoming and I thought it would be helpful for me to personally clarify to you what we know today, and to outline what we hope to find out in the ongoing investigation,\" Dunford said in an hour-long news conference.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers has been criticized by lawmakers in Washington and has raised the profile of the deadly incident.\nDunford said for the first time that U.S. forces on the ground in Niger waited an hour before calling for support.\nWithin minutes, a U.S. drone located nearby was moved over the firefight and provided intelligence and full-motion video.\nFrench fighter jets arrived above the scene about an hour after that, said Dunford.\n\"It is important to note that when they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgment would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support,\" Dunford said.\nThe French fighters did not drop bombs when they arrived, something Dunford said was under investigation.\n\nQUESTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS\nRepublican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said last week he may consider issuing a subpoena because the White House had not been forthcoming with details of the attack.\nOn Monday, McCain said lawmakers were getting cooperation and information from the Pentagon and expected a \"formal hearing\" on Thursday about the ambush.\nThe attack threw a spotlight on the little-known counterterrorism mission in the West African country, which has about 800 U.S. troops, out of a total of 6,000 U.S. troops in Africa. The United States says it is there to support Niger in fighting Islamist extremists.\nThe Pentagon said at the time that three soldiers had been killed in the ambush. The body of a fourth soldier, Sergeant La David Johnson, was recovered about two days later.\nDunford said that on Oct. 3, a dozen U.S. soldiers accompanied 30 Nigerien forces on a reconnaissance mission near the village of Tongo Tongo.\nAfter spending the night near the village, the forces were moving back to their base when they came under attack from about 50 enemy fighters, who appeared to be from a local Islamic State affiliate. The militants attacked with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades, Dunford said.\n\"It was planned as a reconnaissance mission,\" Dunford said. \"What happened after they began to execute, in other words, did the mission change? That is one of the questions that's being asked,\" he said.\n\nCONSIDERED A LOWER-RISK MISSION\nThe mission had been seen as a relatively lower-risk endeavor for elite U.S. commandos and there was no armed air cover at the time that could carry out air strikes if necessary.\nHe added there was no indication the soldiers had taken too many risks.\n\"I don't have any indication right now to believe or to know that they did anything other than operate within the orders they were given,\" Dunford said.\nU.S. forces were conducting normal operations in Niger again and the plan was for them to continue to train and advise local partners. Dunford said there had been no discussions about increasing U.S. troops.\nA controversy has swirled for a week over how Trump has handled the task of consoling relatives of slain service members.\nMyeshia Johnson, the widow of the Army sergeant killed in Niger, said on Monday that Trump had \"made me cry even worse\" in a condolence call when he said her husband \"knew what he signed up for.\"\n\"We owe the families as much information as we can find out about what happened, and we owe the American people an explanation of what their men and women were doing at this particular time,\" Dunford said.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Additional reporting by David Alexander, Eric Walsh and Amanda Becker; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Peter Cooney)",

      "text": "By Valerie Volcovici\nWASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. federal government should adopt a strategy to manage climate change risks, as their cost to the government may rise as much as $35 billion per year by mid-century, a congressional watchdog office report released on Monday said. The report from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office comes as Congress weighs aid packages for U.S. victims of deadly hurricanes and wildfires that struck in 2017, with losses already estimated at more than $300 billion.\nPresident Donald Trump, a climate change doubter, rolled back Obama administration directives requiring federal agencies to prepare plans to address climate risks in March, and agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency have cut climate change research.\nThe report was written at the request of Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, who asked for a comprehensive study on the costs and risks to the U.S. government from climate change in November 2015.\n\"Climate change impacts are already costing the federal government money, and these costs will likely increase over time as the climate continues to change,\" the report said.\nExtreme weather and fire events have cost the federal government over $350 billion over the last decade, the report said, citing the Office of Management and Budget.\nPreliminary government estimates of the economic losses of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the wildfires in nine western states combined this year alone are poised to exceed $300 billion.\n\"Our government cannot afford to spend more than $300 billion each year in response to severe weather events that are connected to warming waters, which produce stronger hurricanes,\" said Maine Senator Collins.\nCantwell, lead Democratic on the Senate energy committee, whose home state Washington was affected by wildfires, said the report warns that the federal government will need to pay \"trillions more in the future unless we mitigate the impacts.\"\nThe GAO recommended that White House executive offices, including the Office of Science and Technology Policy, use available economic reports to \"craft appropriate federal responses.\"\nThe president has not appointed a chief scientific policy officer.\nThe report said the government should use available national economic studies that have attempted to quantify the economic effects of climate change, including the American Climate Prospectus study and the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis.\n\"Several experts we interviewed noted that even though the methods produce imprecise results, they can convey useful insight into broad themes about potential climate damages across sectors in the United States,\" the report said. The American Climate Prospectus study, for example, said the Southeast, Midwest and Great Plains regions will likely experience greater combined economic effects from climate change than other regions, due to coastal property damage in the Southeast and crop yield changes in the Midwest and Great Plains.

You can play multiplayer games with these titles across console types, but only in System Link mode.\n\"Now there are other players with nuclear competence\", Goldfein said, pointing out that the world is not a bipolar place where the main actors are only the USA and the Soviet Union.\nThe decision was made against the backdrop of \"the rapid development of North Korea's nuclear arsenal\", according to David Goldfein and other senior USA military officials Quote: d by the newspaper, which in turn 'do not hesitate to emphasize President Trump's hawkish approach to Pyongyang.' The rise in Russian military potential is also cited. \"It's never been more important to make sure that we get this mission right\".\nIn a report by security news website Defense One , Air Force chief of staff Gen. David Goldfein said the military was considering the move in light of rising tensions with North Korea.\nHe said: \"I've challenged Air Force Global Strike Command to help lead the dialogue, help with this discussion about 'What does conventional conflict look like with a nuclear element?' and 'Do we respond as a global force if that were to occur?' and 'What are the options?'\". He also asked his team to think of innovative ways a nuclear weapon can be used, either for deterrence or combat.\nPollution-related deaths in India rank among the highest globally, study reveals\nMost of these nine million deaths occur from pollution-related diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and lung-cancer. Other nations with deadly environments include Haiti , Bangladesh, South Sudan, Pakistan and North Korea .\nBarksdale Air Force base in northwestern Louisiana is the home of Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all nuclear forces the Air Force has under it's command. Still, at least one tangible sign of the potential move is in motion: The building where B-52 crews slept during the Cold War is being renovated, notes Defense One .\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later asserted that the diplomatic efforts to relax tensed relations with North Korea would continue \"until the first bomb drops\".\nThe situation on the Korean Peninsula has grown progressively tenser as Pyongyang has continued to launch a missile and nuclear tests, in spite of warnings of the global community and, in particular, the United States.\nEuropean Union leaders meeting in Brussels to issue statement on Iran nuclear deal\nHe is also determined to confront Iran's meddling in neighbouring states. He called on Europe to actively oppose Mr Trump's position. They had lobbied the administration hard and lost.",

      "text": "BYD bags mass transit order in Egypt 1 2017-10-24 09:11 China Daily Editor: Liang Meichen ECNS App Download \nElectric vehicle maker BYD Co Ltd is planning to start trial runs of its SkyRail monorail mass transit solution in Egypt soon, making it the second overseas destination for the Chinese company after the Philippines. \nDemand for mass transit systems has been increasing in both the countries－key markets in China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. BYD officials told China Daily that the company was confident of further cooperation with these countries in the future. \nThe transportation authority of Alexandria, Egypt's second largest city, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with BYD for the project on Oct 21. The MoU envisages a monorail project spanning 128 kilometers and plans to conduct feasibility studies. It also marks the first time that SkyRail is being showcased in the African continent. \nAlexandria is a well-known historic and cultural city, but plagued by frequent traffic jams. In 2013, local authorities began exploring options to relieve transportation pressure. \n\"BYD's SkyRail is a clean, affordable and safe way for people to commute. It also utilizes limited road space in towns and cities while minimizing disruption to local communities,\" said AD Huang, general manager of BYD Middle East and Africa Auto Sales Division. \nThirteen years ago, the carmaker started manufacture and sales of passenger vehicles in Egypt. Nearly one-thirds of the taxis in Cairo are made by BYD. \nKhaled Eleiwa, chairman of the Alexandria Passenger Transportation Authority, said he expects the SkyRail to start operations in the seaport city as soon as possible. \nUnlike subways, BYD's Sky-Rail requires only a fifth of the cost and one third of the construction time, according to the company. \nOne is currently operating in Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region. \nMonorail is now among BYD's four key business sectors which also include cars, mobile phone components and batteries. According to Securities Times, BYD has received intent orders from 10 cities so far. \nWang Liusheng, chief analyst for the automobile industry at CSM Securities, said he expects BYD's monorail operations to realize profits and generate income this year. \nBut he admitted that the profits would be minuscule for now and it would be difficult to gauge whether the same would grow as per market expectations in the future. \nBYD's shares declined by 3.69 percent and 2.39 percent in the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges on Monday.",

A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra considered the report of advocate Gaurav Agarawal, who is assisting it as an amicus curiae, which said that out of several home buyers of Supertech’s twin Emerald Towers, 26 have not received any refund. The bench, which also comprised Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, said that Rs 20 crore has been deposited with the apex court registry by the prominent real estate firm and the money would be used in paying back the principal amount to the home buyers who have received nothing in refund. It also asked Amicus Curiae Agarawal to assist in disbursal. The court said the issue of interest and the deduction of return on investment (RoI) from the principal, payable to home buyers, would be dealt with at later stage. Advocates Akhilesh Kumar Pandey and Shoeb Alam, appearing for some home buyers, said the interest of the hassled home buyers needed to be protected. The bench, which had asked the amicus curiae to set up a web portal to deal with grievances of home buyers on September 22, said that Rs two lakh be paid to him towards expenses incurred in setting up of the portal. It posted for December 4 the final disposal of appeals of Supertech filed against the Allahabad High Court’s April 11, 2014 verdict ordering demolition of the twin towers–Apex and Ceyane– and directing the realty major to refund money to home buyers with 14 per cent interest in three months. Earlier, the top court had asked the home buyers to register and lodge their grievances on the web portal set up by the amicus curiae. It had asked the amicus curiae to include in the web portal the entire details of home buyers of these twin towers and the money paid by them and refunds made by the firm. The real estate firm had said it had deposited Rs 20 crore with the apex court registry for refunding money to the home buyers who did not want flats. The apex court, on August 14, had asked Supertech to deposit Rs 10 crore for refunding money to the investors. Penal action In an important verdict, the Supreme Court Monday ordered refund of principal amount of 26 home buyers who had booked flats in a Supertech project at Noida in Uttar Pradesh The apex court, on August 14, had asked Supertech to deposit Rs 10 crore for refunding money to the investors who wanted to opt out of the project Share this Post:",

      "text": "Bautista's impeachment case declared moot Tuesday, October 24, 2017 \nMANILA. Commission on Elections Chairman Andres Bautista (SunStar Philippines file photo/Al Padilla) \nMANILA (Updated) -- The House committee on justice declared moot and academic on Tuesday, October 24, the impeachment complaint against Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman Juan Andres Bautista. \nMindoro Oriental Representative Reynaldo Umali, panel chair, said President Rodrigo Duterte's acceptance of Bautista's offer to resign mooted the impeachment process against the Comelec chair. \nOn October 11, Bautista submitted a resignation letter effective December 31, citing the need to prioritize his family, but the President officially accepted it on Monday, October 23. \n\"The Palace has accepted the resignation of Commission on Elections' Chairman Andres Bautista effective immediately,\" Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said. \nHe said the six remaining Comelec commissioners, in the meantime, can appoint the poll agency's officer-in-charge. \n\"As an independent commission, the Comelec will resolve among its remaining commissioners as to who will be the officer in charge, until such time the President appoints the new chair,\" Abella added. \nHe said the President has yet to appoint a new chairman of Comelec. \nDuterte in an earlier interview said that it was not necessary to oust Bautista since the latter already decided to resign. \nBautista said Monday that he got the news from Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea informing him that the President had accepted his resignation \"effective immediately.\" \nThe House panel was supposed to tackle the Articles of Impeachment against Bautista after the House of Representatives voted to proceed with the impeachment complaint against the poll chief for culpable violation of the Constitution and betrayal of public trust. \nMajority of the House members voted to override the recommendation of the justice panel to dismiss the impeachment complaint. \nThe impeachment complaint was filed by former Negros Oriental representative Jacinto Paras and lawyers Ferdinand Topacio and Manuelito Luna. \nAside from Bautista, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno is also facing an impeachment complaint before the House justice committee. \nAmid Bautista's resignation, there were speculations that Duterte's chief legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, was eyeing to assume the position. \nAbella, however, refused to comment on Panelo's alleged desire to serve as Comelec chief. \nPanelo, in a separate statement, dismissed as \"mere hearsay\" his alleged plan to replace Bautista. \n\"That's a mere hearsay. There have long been persistent rumors that I want to be the Comelec chairman. I am not interested to assume that position,\" he said. (PS Jun M.

      "text": "Print Article \nFormer UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks during his news conference in Seoul, South Korea January 31, 2017. — Reuters pic LONDON, Oct 24 — US President Donald Trump is “standing on the wrong side of history” in withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, former UN chief Ban Ki-moon told AFP in London yesterday. \n“I am deeply concerned about what President Trump of (the) United States has declared that the US is withdrawing from this Paris agreement. \n“I have been speaking out that his vision is politically short-sighted, and economically irresponsible and scientifically wrong. So he is standing on the wrong side of history,” Ban said on the sidelines of a London peace walk. \nThe former Secretary-General of the United Nations joined other members of The Elders, a group created by Nelson Mandela, on the procession through the city before a discussion on world peace. \nBan said despite Trump’s decision to pull out of the historic Paris agreement, he remained heartened by a US civil society campaign to continue to honour the environmental deal. \n“I am encouraged and hopeful that whole worlds will be united in moving ahead with this Paris climate change agreement. This is the political and moral responsibility of our political leaders,” he said. \nTrump announced in June the start of a three-year process to pull out of the 2015 agreement, signed by 195 countries, on the grounds that it would put the US at an economic disadvantage. \nReflecting on the broader political climate, Ban said he had been “working very closely” with Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, who last week criticised the “politics of division” which characterised the 2016 US presidential race. \nBan also decried the current “lack of commitment” to an international spirit. \n“A lack of leaders’ global vision that we are living in a very tightly-interconnected small world, and that whatever is happening in this country may affect the neighbouring countries and even all around the world,” he said. \nHe cited the “very tense period” on the divided Korean peninsula — with Pyongyang staging its sixth nuclear test and launching two intercontinental ballistic missiles — as one area where world leaders needed to act collectively. \n“As one of the Korean citizens, I’m very much committed that the whole international community should stand resolute and unified and strong voices, so that North Korea realises that there is no other way but to return to dialogue to address these issues,” he said. — AFPx",

      "text": "Texas Governor to lead trade delegation to India next year PTI Tweet Houston, Oct 24: Texas Governor Greg Abbott is planning to take a trade delegation to India next year as part of his effort to further increase trade and economic ties between the two countries. Abbott made the announcement in this regard during Diwali celebrations for members of the Indian-American community at the Governor’s Mansion in Texas capital, Austin on Sunday. Abbott and first lady Cecilia welcomed over 30 Indo— American community members from Austin, Houston, Dallas and other places, at their sprawling mansion and lighted the ceremonial Diwali lamp. “Diwali lamp has found a permanent home at the governor’s mansion in Austin, this is the third year in a row,” Abbott said. “Diwali and India community’s spirit of victory over evil, light over darkness inclusiveness is very similar to the values of the Americans,” he added. During the celebration, Abbott announced about his plans to lead a trade delegation to India next year as part of his effort to increase bilateral trade and economic ties between the two countries. The mission will focus on increasing trade and investment between Texas and India in a range of sectors. He also expressed admiration and appreciation for the Indian—Americans contribution and voluntarism during Harvey. The way Texans came together and responded to affected people during Harvey is an example, he said. 700 Indian—American volunteers dedicated more than 24,000 hours to Texas during Harvey and together they distributed over 28,000 meals to the locals in need. No rescuer asked about the race or the colour of the person he or she is going to rescue. It was just a service to a fellow human being and that is what matters, he said. Consul General Anupam Ray thanked the governor and the first lady of Texas for opening doors of their mansion on Diwali. Ray also highlighted the accomplishments of Indo—American community in Texas in 2017, including honouring Ian Grillot, having first successful Houston India conference in March 2017 where Texas and Indian businesses, think tank experts came together to increase bilateral trade and investment. India’s purchase of first USD 1 billion worth of gas from Texas, Texas community colleges led by Indo—American firm Cambridge Education partnering to work with Skills India mission, and purchase of USD 100 billion worth of defence equipment and helicopters.",

      "text": "NEW DELHI: The FIFA Under-17 World Cup semifinal between Brazil and England was on Monday shifted from Guwahati to Kolkata due to poor pitch conditions in the North-Eastern city, a development which will cause inconvenience to the two teams.\nThe match, which was to be played at the Indira Gandhi stadium at the Assam capital, will be held as scheduled on October 25 but at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.\n\"Following a thorough assessment of the pitch conditions at Guwahati's Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium , which has been affected by severe rainfall over the past few days, FIFA has decided to move the venue of the semi-final between England and Brazil to Kolkata's Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan , where the match will kick off at 17:00hrs,\" the FIFA said in a statement.\nThe change of venue will cause some inconvenience to the English and Brazillian teams as they had already landed in Guwahati. The two teams were also scheduled to have training sessions in Guwahati this evening.\nThe pitch at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium was severely affected during the quarterfinal match between Ghana and Mali on Saturday which was played under incessant rain. The Assam capital has been experiencing rain for the last four days, though it relented a bit today.\nRain stopped after light showers in the morning but the ground has been significantly damaged. Ghana coach Samuel Fabian had said that the match should have been postponed and played on another date after his side lost to Mali 1-2.\n\"Despite the great efforts by all involved parties, including the authorities of Guwahati, to preserve the pitch, FIFA has taken this decision following consultations with both teams in order to safeguard the players' health and to ensure the best playing conditions,\" the FIFA added.\nThe second semi-final on October 25, between Mali and Spain, will still kick off as planned at 2000hrs at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.\nFans with a valid ticket for the semi-final originally planned to take place in Guwahati will be entitled for a refund.\nAll purchasable tickets for the rescheduled game in Kolkata will be priced at Rs 100 and made available on a first-come-first-served basis.\nThe original Guwahati ticket-holders would be required to carry online proof of purchase to the dedicated ticket counter for Guwahati customers, should they travel to Kolkata. These tickets have also been priced at Rs 100.\nFIFA and the Local Organising Committee said it regretted that the match had to be shifted out of Guwahati.\n\"FIFA and the LOC regret that unforeseen circumstances have led to this decision, which will deprive football fans in Guwahati of this semi-final encounter. Both FIFA and the LOC would like to sincerely thank the city of Guwahati and the state government of Assam for their excellent cooperation throughout the competition.\"",

      "text": "GHSMC moving ahead with Garoland demand   \nStaff Reporter TURA, Oct 23: Buoyed by their talks with the centre, the Garo Hills State Movement Committee (GHSMC) is set to hold a public rally in the town of Tura in support of their demand for a separate Garoland state on November 15.Announcing the event, the committee’s chairman, Nikman Ch Marak said, “Recently from 1-5 August, we approached the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi at Delhi on the matter and submitted a memorandum on the demand for a separate Garoland state.” \n“We demanded a separate state to include the five districts of Garo Hills. We held fruitful meeting with Minister of State, Kiren Rijiju, Home Minister, Rajnath Singh and Shillong MP, Vincent Pala. A copy of the memorandum was also submitted to the office of the president of India and the office of the PM,” he added.The GHSMC later held a meeting on September 9 under the chairmanship of Nikman at Tura.“We demand a separate state under the Constitution of India framed by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, in order to safeguard tribal societies of India like Garos under the Article 3, creation of new state for the distinct language and culture under State Re-Organisation Act, 1956,” stated the release.Incidentally the rally on November 15 at Tura Chandmary playground would be the 21st such rally undertaken by the GHSMC in support for their demand.“We would like to request all, without bias to come forward and support the movement for a separate state. We would also like to request the entire Garo Community of entire North-East Region, the state, the country and the world to give support to make this a global event,” added the GHSMC.The rally is set to start at 11 am on the said date.",

      "text": "NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways may soon unlock its prime residential property across the country for redevelopment, a move that could bring in additional revenue of Rs 20,000-25,000 crore for the national transporter. \n\nThe Railways owns real estate in all major cities and has swathes of residential property in Connaught Place, Nizamuddin and Chanakyapuri in New Delhi, apart from land in the heart of Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune. The plan is to grant 99-year leases to developers making compelling offers for such land, a senior Railway Board official said. \n\nThe ministry has asked all 17 zonal offices to compile details of residential land that can be redeveloped and offered to investors. The Railways has over 40,000 hectares of land, of which almost 950 hectares has been encroached upon. \n\nWork on the plan to unlock railway real estate for commercial development was started during Suresh Prabhu’s tenure as minister. Now, with Piyush Goyal taking his place, the project is being implemented with renewed interest. \n\n\n\n“We have huge residential colonies spread across the country. Railways, through builders, can redevelop the area by constructing multi-storey buildings and towers. Whatever is needed for railway requirement can be kept aside, remaining towers could be leased out,” the official said. \n\nGoyal took up the issue of redeveloping and unlocking railway land at a meeting with real estate companies last month. \n\nThe Railways is looking at the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) model. NBCC redevelops government colonies by making high-rise buildings and commercial complexes and leases part of the property to private parties, setting aside some units for government use. \n\n“We could have a similar model. The Railway Land Development Authority will be the nodal agency for all land redevelopment projects, whereas the Indian Railway Station Redevelopment Corp. will oversee the redevelopment of railway stations,” the official added. The station redevelopment project envisages building of apartments on land adjoining railway stations. The Railways is bidding out 23 stations for such redevelopment. 0 Comments",

File image of Madras High Court. News18 \nThe authorities were directed to immediately inspect old structures and carry out necessary repair works. \nThey were also asked to ensure adequate treatment and compensation to the victims of the incident and their families. \nOn 20 October, a portion of an over six-decade-old building of the TNSTC in Nagapattinam district had collapsed, killing eight crew members. \nThe TNSTC employees were sleeping in the building, which was constructed in 1952, when it collapsed around 3.30 am, killing them on the spot, police officials had said. \nThree persons were injured and they were rushed to the Karaikal General Hospital. \nPublished Date: Oct 24, 2017 07:20 am | Updated Date: Oct 24, 2017 07:20 am",

      "text": "Continue reading \nRajat Kabade \nThe Indian Bank's Association (IBA) has written a letter to the government questioning UIDAI's authority in issuing orders to the banks. UIDAI has recently started forcing banks to open enrollment and updating centers. \nThe letter clearly states that only the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can issue directives to the banks under the Banking Regulation Act. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is a nodal body that issues Aadhaar identification number. The Aadhaar-issuing body has recently started complaining about cooperation from banks. \nUIDAI had asked private as well as public sector banks to open Aadhaar enrollment and updating facility within bank's premises in July. The nodal body had asked the banks to open at least one-tenth of their branches by the end of August. Later UIDAI extended the deadline by a month and said it will impose Rs 20,000 fine per uncovered branch after September 30th. \nAadhaar-issuing body later published another directive on October 7th forcing all the banks to become Aadhaar registrar and enrollment agency. The directive signed by UIDAI chief, Ajay Bhushan Pandey further stated that banks will no longer be able to engage private agencies for Aadhaar enrollment of their customers. The circular was sent to all the 15,300 targeted branches by the UIDAI. \nThe Indian Bank Association's letter to the government highlights all the issues associated with banks creating Aadhaar facility within their branches. The enrollment and registration of Aadhaar is not the primary function of banks. The external authority demanding the banks to include Aadhaar enrollment as part of banking activities is not approved by the RBI yet. \nReserve Bank of India has not published any official circular regarding mandatory linking of Aadhaar number with bank accounts. The banks are demanding the freedom to design their own strategy for Aadhaar enrollment considering the available workforce.",

      "text": "Thousands of Rohingyas waiting to enter Bangladesh AFP . Teknaf | Update: 09:40, Oct 23, 2017 0 Like \nAuthorities in Bangladesh were bracing Sunday for another possible surge in Rohingya refugee arrivals, with thousands from the Muslim minority believed stranded along the border with Myanmar waiting to cross. \nBorder guards are also concerned that the relaxing later Sunday of a temporary ban on fishing in the Bay of Bengal could see a surge in people-smuggling along the coast as unscrupulous captains return to the seas. \nRohingya refugees already in Bangladesh have received videos from families across the border showing thousands of displaced Muslims massing near crossing points, waiting for an opportunity to cross. \n\"We have seen some videos sent by people across the border. There are many gathered there. The number could be big,\" Border Guard Bangladesh commander Lieutenant Colonel S.M. Ariful Islam told AFP, without giving an estimate. \nAlmost 600,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since late August, when militant attacks on Myanmar's security forces in Rakhine state sparked a major army crackdown on the community likened by the UN and others to ethnic cleansing. \nAround 10,000 were left stranded in no man's land near Anjumanpara village for three days last week after being prevented from crossing into Bangladesh. They were finally permitted by authorities to enter Thursday. \nThe influx has slowed since then, with charities and officials reporting about 200 people crossing the Naf River dividing the two countries. \n\"(But) those that came told us thousands were still stranded on the other side of Naf,\" Jashim Uddin, a volunteer for the International Organisation for Migration, told AFP. \nAnother border guard told AFP an estimated 10-15,000 refugees were heading to Anjumanpara but had been pushed back. \n\"We heard from their relatives that the Myanmar army has stopped them from heading to the border,\" said a Border Guard spokesman, Iqbal Ahmed. \nRefugees arriving Sunday described violence in their villages in Rakhine and food shortages that had forced countless numbers to flee. \n\"We hardly had any food for the last 10-15 days. They torched our home. We did not have any choice but to leave,\" Yasmin, who goes by one name, told AFP at the coastal village of Shah Porir Dwip. \nAuthorities meanwhile are on high alert for fishermen seeking to ferry refugees to Bangladesh via the open sea as the temporary fishing ban expires later Sunday. \n\"It is risky, but you can make a lot of money ferrying Rohingya to Bangladesh,\" said local fisherman Shawkat Hossain.",

An acknowledgement for receipt of the complaint has been issued. No first information report (FIR) had been lodged,\" a police official in Anna Nagar police station in Madurai told IANS over phone on Monday. \nTemple town Madurai is around 500 km from Chennai. \nMersal is in the midst of a controversy after the Tamil Nadu unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded the removal of certain dialogues which take a dig at the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Digital India. \nDirected by Atlee, Mersal stars Vijay in the roles of a village head, a doctor and a magician. It is doing brisk business at the box office. \nBJP's National Secretary H. Raja and Tamil Nadu BJP President Tamilisai Soundararajan criticised Vijay and the movie for the dialogues critical of GST and Digital India. \nThe BJP leaders said the dialogues were factually incorrect. \nIn a tweet on Monday, Soundararajan said like the freedom to express views, one has the freedom to rebut wrong views. \nRaja, who raked up the actor's Christian origin by his tweet \"Joseph Vijay's hatred for Modi is Mersal \" on October 21, continued that on Monday. \nHe uploaded the actor's voter identity card and a letter written by the actor to a magazine on his letter pad. \n\"Truth is bitter,\" tweeted Raja on Monday uploading the two documents to underscore Vijay's religion. \nVijay, who had met Narendra Modi during electioneering ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, had even lauded demonetisation last year.",

      "text": "Texas Governor to lead trade delegation to India next year PTI Tweet Houston, Oct 24: Texas Governor Greg Abbott is planning to take a trade delegation to India next year as part of his effort to further increase trade and economic ties between the two countries. Abbott made the announcement in this regard during Diwali celebrations for members of the Indian-American community at the Governor’s Mansion in Texas capital, Austin on Sunday. Abbott and first lady Cecilia welcomed over 30 Indo— American community members from Austin, Houston, Dallas and other places, at their sprawling mansion and lighted the ceremonial Diwali lamp. “Diwali lamp has found a permanent home at the governor’s mansion in Austin, this is the third year in a row,” Abbott said. “Diwali and India community’s spirit of victory over evil, light over darkness inclusiveness is very similar to the values of the Americans,” he added. During the celebration, Abbott announced about his plans to lead a trade delegation to India next year as part of his effort to increase bilateral trade and economic ties between the two countries. The mission will focus on increasing trade and investment between Texas and India in a range of sectors. He also expressed admiration and appreciation for the Indian—Americans contribution and voluntarism during Harvey. The way Texans came together and responded to affected people during Harvey is an example, he said. 700 Indian—American volunteers dedicated more than 24,000 hours to Texas during Harvey and together they distributed over 28,000 meals to the locals in need. No rescuer asked about the race or the colour of the person he or she is going to rescue. It was just a service to a fellow human being and that is what matters, he said. Consul General Anupam Ray thanked the governor and the first lady of Texas for opening doors of their mansion on Diwali. Ray also highlighted the accomplishments of Indo—American community in Texas in 2017, including honouring Ian Grillot, having first successful Houston India conference in March 2017 where Texas and Indian businesses, think tank experts came together to increase bilateral trade and investment. India’s purchase of first USD 1 billion worth of gas from Texas, Texas community colleges led by Indo—American firm Cambridge Education partnering to work with Skills India mission, and purchase of USD 100 billion worth of defence equipment and helicopters.",

The two teams were also scheduled to have training sessions in Guwahati this evening.\nThe pitch at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium was severely affected during the quarterfinal match between Ghana and Mali on Saturday which was played under incessant rain. The Assam capital has been experiencing rain for the last four days, though it relented a bit today.\nRain stopped after light showers in the morning but the ground has been significantly damaged. Ghana coach Samuel Fabian had said that the match should have been postponed and played on another date after his side lost to Mali 1-2.\n\"Despite the great efforts by all involved parties, including the authorities of Guwahati, to preserve the pitch, FIFA has taken this decision following consultations with both teams in order to safeguard the players' health and to ensure the best playing conditions,\" the FIFA added.\nRead Also:\nPullela Gopichand: Would be too optimistic to call ourselves dominant force\nThe second semi-final on October 25, between Mali and Spain, will still kick off as planned at 2000hrs at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.\nFans with a valid ticket for the semi-final originally planned to take place in Guwahati will be entitled for a refund.\nAll purchasable tickets for the rescheduled game in Kolkata will be priced at Rs 100 and made available on a first-come-first-served basis.\nThe original Guwahati ticket-holders would be required to carry online proof of purchase to the dedicated ticket counter for Guwahati customers, should they travel to Kolkata. These tickets have also been priced at Rs 100.\nFIFA and the Local Organising Committee said it regretted that the match had to be shifted out of Guwahati.\n\"FIFA and the LOC regret that unforeseen circumstances have led to this decision, which will deprive football fans in Guwahati of this semi-final encounter. Both FIFA and the LOC would like to sincerely thank the city of Guwahati and the state government of Assam for their excellent cooperation throughout the competition.\"\nRead Also:\nWith tweets on SAI nomenclature, Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore hints at dramatic revamp",

      "text": "TECH Rocketships awards look to connect India's fast-rising tech stars with the UK's world-leading growth ecosystem of VC's, advisors, customers and support networks. In its fourth edition, Amo Kalar, UK Deputy Trade and Investment Commissioner to India, talks about why TECH Rocketships is bigger and better this year and what it means for Indian startups and India-UK relationship.\n\nEconomic Times (ET): In its fourth year, what does Tech Rocketship Awards aim to achieve this year? \nAmo Kalar (AK): TECH Rocketships requires no real introduction; it has been running for four years now, and last year- with a Royal launch and PM closing it - we took it to another level. So the stakes are even higher this year. But, the fourth edition, which will launch on October 27 in New Delhi, will be better than ever.\n\nLike previous years our judges will be the very best of India's entrepreneurs and thought-leaders in the space; so think Kiran Muzumdar Shaw, Arvind Gupta, Mohandas Pai and Saurabh Srivastava amongst many others, including the British High Commissioner Sir Dominic Asquith\n\nThey are all endorsing TECH Rocketship because they see its potential and brand value as a competition which has gradually established itself as a happy hunting ground for the best and brightest Indian entrepreneurs. And following some strong support from the Department for International Trade (DIT) in the UK and many other partners, we will be opening the awards up to high-growth tech companies in sectors where the UK has natural strengths, but crucially those with real potential to land and run successful businesses globally, especially in the UK.\n\nWe all know it is the world's best place to establish and grow a technology business. So whilst we will continue to support last year's stars like Project Mudra - amazingly founded by engineering students in their university lab and now funded by Anand Mahindra and others thanks to TECH Rocketship - this year we are looking for Indian scale-ups to become much more involved in the awards..\n\n\nET: What are the sectors in focus this year and has this changed since starting the award?\nAK: The UK's technology sector is larger than the rest of Europe combined and it has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the UK over the last decade. Technology plays a vital enabling role across a range of sectors where the UK has strengths: automotive/electric vehicles, Fintech, life sciences, clinical trials, agritech and logistics to name a (very) few.\n\nThis year we have matched Rocketship's focus categories to match HMG/ DIT's technology investment priorities. It's brilliant that these match those where India has both technology demands and inward investment potential. So think fintech, medtech, ioT, cloud computing & data analytics, cyber security and artificial intelligence and you are in the right place. These are the UK's fastest growing sectors, and the prizes for winning have evolved to include partnerships with UK companies in these sectors. \n\nThe UK offers an outstanding environment for global tech companies with a strong startup culture bolstered by tech clusters all over the UK. In areas like Cyber - the UK is investing £14.5 billion in its cyber security defences, which will make the UK the best place to start and grow a digital business and the safest place to be online.\n\nET: How will the winners for 2017 be determined and what's in it for the winners?\nAK: The awards have always seen the best of entrants from across India. Last year over 1000 startups applied to be one of the ten winners. This year again we have the support from the Indian Angel Network - the leading tech start-up support organisation globally. We are very excited to have such a highly regarded panel supporting us to select the best this year.\n\nAfter the launch in Delhi, which will see a live pitching session with the judges, followed by another in Bengaluru (Kiran Mazumdar Shaw as a panellist) and ending with the grand finale in Mumbai in February. Again there I can promise some star-due for our winners! \n\nThis year the stakes for us are much higher, scale-ups are busy growing their companies and accessing new opportunities. So we have had to work even harder to grab their attention and get the UK message across. This is why the prize has also developed - winners will get the chance to pitch to UK VCs during the world-renowned London Tech Week when they visit the UK, get into partnerships with established UK leaders and immerse themselves in the R&D. They would also get a chance to spend some quality time with companies across UK in similar sectors where various synergies from tech to skill exchange will be possible.\n\nFor more details please check: https://www.events.trade.gov.uk/tech-rocketship-awards-2017-18- \n\nET: How have previous year's winners benefited from the award?\nAK: TECH Rocketship Awards has been transformational for previous winners. Get My Parking received £0.9 million investment from Indian Angel Network, and are in the process of negotiating a business deal with a major European parking operator. As part of this, the UK will be one of the top countries where they will deploy their technology. Project Mudra, the 2015-16 winners had the opportunity to teach Braille to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during the Tech Summit, and they have received angel investment from none other than Anand Mahindra. Being an Indian startup trying to expand to the UK market, TECH Rocketship helped them build new connections in the UK, especially London and Bristol where they are attracting investors and customers.\n\nAnother winner Rep UP received funding from IAN and are currently targeting a strong hotel client base in the UK. Rep UP have now invested in the UK, having registered a company and developed a plan to start operations by next year. TECH Rocketship Awards winner Talocity, of video interview fame is in conversation with 12 UK based companies offering them their services, having pitched to Emma Sinclair in her airport cab back from the Tech Summit. They have already developed a back-office team for UK entry, which will begin with a UK marketing office by next financial year.\n\nPlease speak to our winners rather than boring old me - they are its biggest fans! Rocketship helped them receive support in terms of mentoring, networking and crucially the access to capital that has made them so successful as UK investors. Remember, Wipro, HCL and Tata had to start somewhere.\n\n\nET: Why are such programmes important for India- UK trade/relationship?\nAK: India needs a million jobs a month for its skilled, dedicated and brightest-of-the bright graduates. PM Modi, through 'Startup India', sees entrepreneurship as part of the solution, and the UK is right alongside. Through TECH Rocketship, we have enabled India's top young entrepreneurs to raise their profile with UK and Indian investors, incubators and business hubs. As we exit the EU, through competitions such as ours, and the upcoming India-UK Future Tech Month, we will hold our top spot as Europe's number one FDI destination.\n\nLast year India safeguarded more jobs in the UK than even the US. The UK has provided an excellent platform for Indian companies to grow their businesses, with the very highest quality financial and professional services, a world beating technology sector and unrivalled ease of doing business. None of that has changed; Indian investors continue their strong run in the UK as its fourth largest investors, with tech and telecommunications sectors accounting for 31% of Indian investments.\n\nWe see the awards strengthening this relationship and also exposing Indian companies to the benefits of globalising via the UK. The future pipeline of success, if we may. 0 Comments",

      "text": "J&K talks: Dineshwar Sharma's appointment may take some pressure off CM, open up political space \nBy Jagriti Negi \nFormer JNU student and activist Kanhaiya Kumar attacked the ruling government for making fake promises during elections and not fulfilling them. He also expressed his opinion on reservation, freedom and social transformation during an interactive session with journalists at the Press Club in Sector 27 on Monday. Here are some excerpts from the interaction: \nYou have been in the limelight several times for talking about azaadi. What freedom you wish for? \nEveryone wants freedom. Freedom has different meaning to everyone at different times. An internet user wants freedom from slow connection. I feel independence is somewhat like freedom from disparities prevailing in every grounds of our society, freedom from capitalism, Brahmanism, caste illiteracy, communal violence and starvation. Today, just because I and you are getting enough food that doesn’t mean that starvation not prevailing in the country. Still there are thousands of people who are struggling for food and shelter every day. We need freedom from hunger and poverty. I feel freedom is somewhat to secure and keep alive independence itself. \nRSS, BJP and left wing — all have their own perception on reservation. What is your opinion? \nReservation should be there or not should be there, it is not a matter of personal opinion. Although an open public debate should be there on such matters. This constitutional provision was meant for those weaker communities who were supposed to get aided in terms of education, job relaxations so that they could uplift and participate with the rest of nation. People have very half baked knowledge about reservation and such matters. People have perception that reservation decides job opportunities, I am not agree with this. One percent jobs are in government sector and rest of the sector is owned by big private corporate houses and MNCs. I ask if there is a 15 percent reservation, how long it affects at national level? \nSocial and economic issues like poverty, employment, quality education are ignored under the shield of crying over reservation. \nRail Mantri ji kehte hai ane wale samayme sarkari naukriyan khatam ho jayegi (no government jobs in near future). We should ask him if jobs will not be there then what is the relevance of his own post? He also should resign and the ministry even should not be even there if he is not able to think about creating jobs. People should raise questions on such statements . \nWhat are your views on participation and involvement of youth in politics? \nRajneetini se mera hamesha sarokar raha hai (I have always been concerned about politics). I feel politics is always connected to our lives in different aspects. The day when we are in mother’s womb politics is started in our families. From our birth to bringing us up, our education, marriage all is planned and decided. For those who wants to join it , Politics is like a wind and we have options to stand up against it or turn tails. I have a very unclear opinion on whether youth should participate in politics . It is completely their own choices but the thing is politics should not be taken as a business which deals only with profit and loss. \nWhat you think Modi is ruling the country or he is monitored by corporate houses? \nDemonetisation and GST resulted beneficial for big corporate houses only not for small or middle scale enterprises. This is the rule in the sea that big fishes eats small ones. Our prime minister helped to get profit big corporate houses only. Before and during election main agenda were corruption, Rs 15lakh in every account, black money, inflation control and others. After coming in rule, the middle class families were gifted with demonetisation and inflation only. I feel Modi is ruling the country in front of its people only. But behind the scene big corporate houses controlling the nation. The basic idea of social transformation is lost . On the basis of hatred and communal discrimination people are getting divided. \nWhat is common between you and Modi ? \nWhat he speaks in public platform matches with my opinion and my principles . But it is only in front of camera and public. Behind the scene our thoughts are not matched. There is a huge difference in his saying and doing . While he speaks in public, he speaks very confidently. He has been ruling for around three years now, has the government succeeded in getting back black money. Did it stop corruption? Did peasants stop committing suicide? Our country is driven by good will. \nIf joined politics, which party you will join BJP or Congress? \nI have never think about joining any party yet. I support our constitution and social transformation. Social transformation should be the main agenda of any government. When we talk of equality it is not the basis of caste , community or place. In India there is a cultural diversity, different communities and religions are there. Despite of talking over the reservation, religions, communal disturbances government should focus on creating employments, skill development, communal harmony and development. As citizen it is responsibility of all of us to keep our eyes open and ask questions to our government we have chosen. \nRight wing using social media to propagate their achievements and reach over masses. I think promotion system can not be an option of the democracy system. I am not that much active in social media because I think I am much engaged in real world than virtual world.

Deepa, urging the government to refrain from issuing press releases with respect to properties left behind by her aunt. \nShe also prayed for restraining the government officials from “visiting, altering or putting up any structure” at the former’s Poes Garden residence, Veda Nilayam. \nJustice K. Ravichandrabaabu issued the direction after recording Advocate General Vijay Narayan’s submission that the government was willing to consider and dispose of the representation made in August this year. Opportunity of hearing \nDisposing of a writ petition filed by Ms. Deepa, the judge made it clear that the Chief Secretary should give an opportunity to hear her as well as “other interested persons” before taking a decision. \nIn her affidavit, Ms. Deepa had said: “Since my aunt died intestate without executing a will or testament, I and my brother J. Deepak are entitled to succeed to her estate.” She objected to a press release issued by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on August 18 for converting Veda Nilayam into a memorial.",

According to reports, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandresekhar Rao wants the upcoming temple at Yadadri to be on par with Andhra Pradesh’s Tirumala, which is the country’s richest temple. A special purpose body for the development of the Yadadri temple has been instated by the government, and it employs around 500 sculptors. Phase-I of this project is expected to be completed by May 2018. As the temple shrine is located among hills, four-lane roads will also be constructed for better connectivity. The temple complex will span 11 acre and will include seven temple domes, with the main dome extending up to 100 ft and tourist facilities that will consist of cottages, parking and housing for priests sprawling across 1,400 acre. As per reports, the temple will have an estimated footfall ranging between 10,000-30,000 per day. The state government is reportedly of the view that the construction of the temple complex will boost economic activity in the region. Tags Cloud",

      "text": "Continue reading \nRajat Kabade \nThe Indian Bank's Association (IBA) has written a letter to the government questioning UIDAI's authority in issuing orders to the banks. UIDAI has recently started forcing banks to open enrollment and updating centers. \nThe letter clearly states that only the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can issue directives to the banks under the Banking Regulation Act. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is a nodal body that issues Aadhaar identification number. The Aadhaar-issuing body has recently started complaining about cooperation from banks. \nUIDAI had asked private as well as public sector banks to open Aadhaar enrollment and updating facility within bank's premises in July. The nodal body had asked the banks to open at least one-tenth of their branches by the end of August. Later UIDAI extended the deadline by a month and said it will impose Rs 20,000 fine per uncovered branch after September 30th. \nAadhaar-issuing body later published another directive on October 7th forcing all the banks to become Aadhaar registrar and enrollment agency. The directive signed by UIDAI chief, Ajay Bhushan Pandey further stated that banks will no longer be able to engage private agencies for Aadhaar enrollment of their customers. The circular was sent to all the 15,300 targeted branches by the UIDAI. \nThe Indian Bank Association's letter to the government highlights all the issues associated with banks creating Aadhaar facility within their branches. The enrollment and registration of Aadhaar is not the primary function of banks. The external authority demanding the banks to include Aadhaar enrollment as part of banking activities is not approved by the RBI yet. \nReserve Bank of India has not published any official circular regarding mandatory linking of Aadhaar number with bank accounts. The banks are demanding the freedom to design their own strategy for Aadhaar enrollment considering the available workforce.",

Vishwas group students are those who have repeatedly failed in classes IX and X. This year, the government has decided to set up 163 study centres in government schools under the Directorate of Education across Delhi, where regular classes will be held at these study centres. \nLast year, each school had their own Vishwas group students and they attended regular classes. They had appeared as private candidates in the Class X boards and had failed in large numbers. Out of 163, as many as 34 nodal centres each for boys and girls will be initially set up which will coordinate all the activities related to the programme \nSo the retired principals/vice principals will be employed as co-ordinators and in-charge of the nodal centres. They will be employed on a contractual basis. Their duty will be to get the students registered with NIOS (online and offline), to monitor and maintain enrolment records. They will also have to keep in touch with the parents and counsel them and their wards to enroll in these study centres. Video of the day   More Top News",

      "text": "What Malaysians want in Budget 2018 By Ida Lim Print Article \nMany Malaysians who are feeling the pinch are hoping for measures and aid that will help ease their burdens. — Reuters pic \nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 24 — As Putrajaya prepares to table Budget 2018 this Friday with a theme of “Shaping the Future”, many Malaysians who are feeling the pinch are hoping for measures and aid that will help ease their burdens. \nHere are some highlights of what Malaysians hope to see in Budget 2018: \nWorkers \nEmployees in both the private and public sectors felt the pressures of rising costs keenly, with the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) focusing particularly on seeking the government’s aid for the B40 and M40, respectively low- and middle-income groups, which it said were facing an “unhealthy income disparity” when compared to the country’s top-earners. \nThe MTUC, in its October 2 wishlist to the government, urged for the current minimum wage of RM1,000 (peninsular Malaysia) and RM920 (Sabah, Sarawak) for the private sector to be almost doubled to RM1,800. \nIt also proposed a RM5 billion revolving fund, to be provided the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) through the Malaysian Building Society Berhad (MBSB), for personal loans of up to RM10,000 for B40 and M40 employees at zero interest and 2 per cent interest, as well as a RM20 billion revolving fund by the government for zero-interest housing loans for the same groups. \nIn its July 20 wishlist to the government, the Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (Cuepacs) noted that the civil servants it represents are the backbone of the administration and catalysts of the private sector’s success, but said it found some to be still living below the poverty line. \nWhile expressing gratitude for the government’s special financial assistance over the past four years, Cuepacs said civil servants had not received a bonus during the same period and would want one and a half months’ of bonus. \nHousing \nWarning of a “homeless generation” of Malaysians who cannot afford to own homes, the National House Buyers Association (HBA) mooted four mechanisms to avert such a crisis, including curbing property speculation through higher stamp duty rates and higher real property gains tax on buyers and sellers who own more than two properties. \nHBA said the government should increase the supply of affordable homes by incentivising private developers with fast-track project approvals, cheaper land conversion or alienation costs, partial tax exemption on profits from such projects. \nIt also mooted a nationwide rent-to-own scheme for the B40 and M40 group to help them overcome the usual 10 per cent deposit hurdle; it also urged the government to intervene by imposing price controls on affordable housing as it knew the actual land costs developers had to bear. \nThe Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) proposed measures to make it easier for first-time buyers of affordable homes, including full stamp duty exemption on higher-value affordable properties instead of the RM300,000 limit announced in the last Budget, as well as exemption from higher conveyancing legal fee rates —— newly introduced this March —— for such properties. \nRehda’s detailed 10-point list also suggested waiving the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on affordable housing construction materials, and allowing first-time homebuyers earning below RM10,000 to have the housing loan interest during the construction period to be included in their affordable housing unit’s price. \nBesides asking for lower business costs, Rehda also said the minimum RM1 million price limit announced in Budget 2014 for foreign buyers of residential properties should be replaced with a three-tier pricing system according to how urbanised a state is. \nEducation \nMTUC argued that the government should provide free education for students from B40 and M40 families to raise their living standards, instead of the current provision of full federal study loan under the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) to students from low-income families which receive the annual BR1M cash aid. \n“In short, we are asking for free education from pre-school till they graduate from university. Children of B40 and M40 be given free education be it public or private universities and current students who are in receipt of PTPTN shall stop repaying immediately,” MTUC secretary-general J. Solomon told Malay Mail Online. \nMTUC also said the government should introduce laws for employers to provide mandatory financial education training for employees annually for free, and to have students taught how to manage their finances as part of the school syllabus. \nA member of youth movement UndiMsia mooted free tertiary education and an automatic conversion of PTPTN to a zero interest or lower interest scheme; as well as for tax rebates on PTPTN repayments. \nAside from seeking RM20 million for National Youth Day celebrations nationwide, the Malaysian Youth Council’s (MYC) proposals mostly revolved around training youths, including a RM10 million one-off grant for seminars on being debt-free and finance management and entrepreneurship. \nMYC also sought a RM15 million allocation for youth organisations to help plan follow-up programmes after the National Transformation 2050 (TN50) proposals are submitted to the prime minister. \nHealthcare \nGrowing healthcare costs prompted the Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) to suggest price controls of private hospitals, and for better public healthcare with more infrastructure and more specialist doctors to cut down on patients’ waiting time. \nThe MTUC said the Employment Act 1955 should be amended to introduce one month’s paid leave to new fathers, also asking that female employees be given 90 days of paid maternity leave for up to five children instead of the minimum 60 days under the same law. \nTransport \nMalaysian Public Transport Users Association (4PAM) president Ajit Johl repeated his suggestion from last year for the formation of a Public Transport Tariff Review and Tribunal Committee, which he said should include all public transport stakeholders such as the users, operators, regulators and report to the relevant ministries. \n“Tariff reviews must be done against pre-agreed KPIs (key performance indicators) and be transparent,” he said, adding that it could even manage proposed tariff reviews for air transport. \n“This same committee can also act like an ombudsman to help users air grievances against operators, specifically the express bus industry,” he said. \nHuman Rights / social needs \nThis year also saw the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) insisting that the government show commitment to human rights in Budget 2018, such as by ensuring sufficient funds to assist refugees and asylum seekers. \nSuhakam said the government should also ensure the disabled community’s needs are sufficiently considered and to ensure significant funds to help the indigenous community realise their land rights. \nFomca mooted a comprehensive social safety net with possible features such as a food stamp programme, cash aid for child care, food aid in school for students and subsidised public transport. \nAn UndiMsia member also proposed a higher budget for the welfare department with a focus on children welfare and social service workers.",

      "text": "The Centre has released Rs 45 crore for farmers to procure straw management machines on subsidised rates. Top News Golmaal Big J-K talks: Dineshwar Sharma's appointment may take some pressure off CM, open up political space Facing a tough challenge in its drive to check stubble burning, the Haryana government has approached the Centre for permission to engage MGNREGA workers to lift paddy crop residue from fields. Haryana Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar told The Indian Express that he has already discussed the issue with Union Rural Development Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.\n“An MLA in the state Assembly on Monday gave this suggestion. It’s a good solution as there will be no shortage of funds under the MGNREGA. The labour under the MGNREGA funds should be allowed to lift the paddy straw for a month during the harvesting season of paddy. We will send a formal request to the Centre which can take a final call on it,” said Dhankar.\nAccording to Dhankar, solution of paddy straw burning requires huge man power as paddy was cultivated in 33 lakh acres of land in the state which has generated 70 lakh tonnes of crop residue. To tackle the problem with short term and long term measures, the state has submitted a five year plan of Rs 1601.57 crore to the Centre, but it released just Rs 45 crore for providing straw management machines to the farmers on subsidy. Haryana has also contributed its share of Rs 30 crore.\nThree days after a farmer Prem Chand, 75, died in a fire caused by burning of paddy stubble in Ambala district of Haryana, the issue of paddy straw dominated Haryana Assembly on Monday.\nThrough a calling attention motion, the main opposition party, the Indian National Lok Dal, urged the government not to lodge FIRs against the farmers but arrange machines for them to process crop residue.\n“The farmers were compelled to burn their left over straw as the state government has not provided any solution to the farmers for this problem. This problem is too grave as the farmers could not make use of such a huge amount of residue and could not store the same as well. If the same is lifted manually, it requires labour charges of Rs 10,000 per acre which a farmer cannot afford,” said Abhay Chautala.\n“The government says that it offers subsidy on the machines. But subsidy of just Rs 50,000 on a machine of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh won’t offer any relief to the farmers,” he added.\n“Sarpanches are being threatened with suspension, if they fail to control the stubble burning. If this is the way, then the Chief Minister should also be suspended for burning the state thrice,” said Chautala in the Assembly indicating violence during Jat quota stir, Dera Sacha Sauda case and the incident involving self-styled godman Rampal.\nINLD MLA and former state Agriculture Minister Jaswinder Singh Sandhu said that the government must find a solution so that their agriculture land may be saved from becoming barren.\nAnother INLD MLA, Balwan Singh Daulatpuria, said that thousands farmers on Monday staged a protest in Fatehabad to seek a viable solution of the problem.\n India",

      "text": "Property market set to continue stabilizing as regulation takes effect, says official Source:Xinhua   22:03:40 China's property market is expected to continue stabilizing in the fourth quarter of this year, a senior government official said on Sunday. The market will continue to see slower growth in transaction volume and stabilizing prices, Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Wang Menghui told a press conference on the sidelines of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. \"For the whole year, the property market will maintain stable performance,\" he said. The government will not waver in its efforts to achieve the goals of property market regulation and will maintain continuity and stability of policies, Wang told reporters. Authorities are studying a \"long-term mechanism\" for real estate regulation and advancing legislative work on the development of the home rental market, he said. Regulatory moves since October last year have had an effect, curbing property buying for speculative and investment purposes and reining in excessively fast price increases, said the minister. He pledged to move faster to put in place a housing system that ensures supply through multiple sources, provides housing support through multiple channels, and encourages both housing purchases and renting. China's rocketing house prices, especially in major cities, had fueled concerns about asset bubbles before dozens of local governments passed or expanded their restrictions on house purchases and increased the minimum down payments. The market was cooled down by relatively tightened liquidity conditions as the government moved to contain leverage and risk in the financial system. Xinhua reported in early October that in North China's Tianjin, most commercial banks' house loan interest rates are 5 to 10 percent higher than the standard interest rate.Of the 70 cities surveyed in August, the pace of new home price growth slowed in 15 of them compared with the same month of last year.

They argue the technology is costly and make them more vulnerable to robbery. \n“We want the government to stop Uber, Cabify and any other applications that try to come here,” said William Trivino, a 38-year-old taxi driver in downtown Bogota. “Protect taxi drivers who...pay taxes and don’t allow someone with a private vehicle and a cell phone to become a taxi.” \nProtesters blocked roads and attacked colleagues that did not join the strike. Police threw tear gas to disperse them. \nThere are some 480,000 registered taxis in Colombia, with 53,000 in Bogota, a city of about 8 million people. \nUber and Cabify operate in a legal vacuum in Colombia, with the Technology, Information and Communication Ministry saying it cannot block them, while the Transport Ministry says they operate illegally but cannot be closed down. \nUber said in a statement that it is a safe and reliable alternative for thousands of users. Cabify said that taxi drivers and app-based services can coexist to provide quality service. — Reuters",

The number of nuclear reactors operating in South Korea will be cut to 14 by 2038 it said.\nPresident Moon Jae-in came to power in May, after running on a ticket that called for reducing South Korea’s nuclear and coal-fired power generation in a push to use more natural gas and renewable energy.\nAfter Moon took office South Korea halted work on the two reactors already under construction and called for a vote on their future amid public concerns over atomic safety. A public opinion survey found nearly 60 percent of the respondents were in favour of resuming construction.\nReporting by Jane Chung; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell",

      "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand could become the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalise cannabis for personal use after an unlikely alliance of populist, centrist and leftist parties put drug policy immediately on the agenda of the incoming government.\nNew Zealand Labour leader Jacinda Ardern smiles as she speaks to the press after leader of New Zealand First party Winston Peters announced his support for her party in Wellington, New Zealand, October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Charlotte Greenfield Recreational marijuana use is legal in several U.S. states and European nations including the Netherlands and Spain, but countries in the Asia-Pacific tend to have strict prohibitions.\nAustralia recently introduced laws freeing up access to cannabis for medicinal use, but does not allow recreational use.\nLabour’s prime minister-designate Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday she agreed with a Greens proposal for a referendum to legalise use of recreational cannabis.\n“We agreed that what we are doing now simply isn’t working, so we have said yes to having that referendum,” Ardern told reporters in Wellington.\nThere is no timeframe for possible legalisation, which would represent the first major reform of drug laws since the 1970s, but would depend on the public first voting to back reforms.\n“Anything that helps shift New Zealand drug laws out of the dinosaur age is going to be a good thing,” Ross Bell, executive director of the charitable NZ Drug Foundation, told Reuters.\n“Arguably it is better for the sustainability of the reform to have a broad church like we’ve got with this government, so that it is not just seen as some sort of fringe liberal policy,” Bell said in a telephone interview.\nDrug law reforms figured in talks to form New Zealand’s new government after a Sept. 23 election failed to yield a majority for either the governing National Party or opposition Labour, although neither major party had such a campaign plank.\nThe centre-left Labour will govern with support from its new junior coalition member, the populist NZ First, which supports holding referendums on controversial issues.\nThe Greens have offered “confidence and supply” and the diverse group of parties is already starting to deliver a melange of policies, from potential relaxation of drug laws to tighter immigration controls.\nNew Zealand’s drug use ranks among the world’s highest, a study by the NZ Drug Foundation shows. Too much money is spent on enforcement and convictions, rather than on health policies, says the body, which gets government and private funding.\nReporting by Jonathan Barrett and Ana Nicolaci Da Costa in WELLINGTON; Editing by Clarence Fernandez",

By PTI \nStepping up his attack against the government over GST, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi today took the Gabbar Singh analogy further by referencing the Bollywood villain's dialogue to say it was a tax that coveted people's earnings. \nGandhi, who had yesterday described the goods and services tax as \"Gabbar Singh Tax\" during a rally in Gujarat, today recalled a much quoted dialogue from \"Sholay\" to sharpen his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \n\"Congress GST = Genuine Simple Tax. Modi ji's GST = Gabbar Singh Tax = yeh kamaai mujhe de de (give me the income),\" Gandhi said on Twitter. \nGabbar Singh was the name of the dacoit in the Ramesh Sippy-directed 1975 Bollywood blockbuster. The character, played by late actor Amjad Khan, says at one point of time in the film, \"Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur (another character)\". \nGandhi had targeted the Centre over the issue yesterday in a rally in Gandhinagar and called for changes in the new tax regime to make it simple. \n\"Their GST is not GST. GST means Gabbar Singh Tax. This is causing a loss to the country. Small shopkeepers are finished. Lakhs of youths have been unemployed. But they are still not ready to listen,\" he had said. He had also stated that the Modi dispensation went ahead with its version of the GST despite the Congress warning the government about the tax regime's \"adverse impact\".",

By PTI \nThe government today approved Rs 7 lakh crore worth highway projects including the ambitious Bharatmala, an official said. \nThe development comes barely few months after Union Minister Nitin Gadkari told PTI that the government will soon launch the Bharatmala project to build over 20,000 km of highways in the first phase. \nThe Cabinet today gave the go ahead to highway projects worth about Rs 7 lakh crore for development of over 80,000 km of highways including Bharatmala project in the next five years, an official who did not wish to be quoted, told PTI. \nRoad, Transport Minister Gadkari had earlier said detailed project reports (DPRs) are being prepared for the Bharatmala project. \nBharatmala is a mega plan of the government and the second-largest highways project after NHDP that saw development of about 50,000 km, and aims at improving connectivity in border and other areas. \nThe official said the highway projects approved today also include economic corridor developments aimed at faster movement of cargo. \nThe government had earlier planned to develop economic corridors with a length of about 21,000 km besides 14,000 km of feeder routes. \nThe corridors included Mumbai-Cochin-Kanyakumari, Bengaluru-Mangaluru, Hyderabad-Panaji and Sambalpur-Ranchi, to name a few. \nA study under the proposed Bharatmala project by global consultancy firm AT Kearney had identified 44 economic corridors. \nThe Prime Minister's Office, earlier this year, had asked for Public Investment Board's (PIB) clearance to the first phase of the project. PIB, chaired by the expenditure secretary had later approved it. Other members of PIB included secretaries of economic affairs, Niti Aayog, statistics and programme implementation, environment and forests, besides the secretary of the administrative ministry concerned.",

By PTI \nRecalling his mother's ordeal of cooking on woodstove, Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy today said the government should provide subsidies to businesses which sell clean energy products like cookstoves in rural India. \nHe also said India should focus more on providing better healthcare facilities, education, nutrition and clean energy to its vast population. \"If country like India has to indeed redeem the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, then India has to work on health, education, nutrition and clean energy,\" Murthy said at an event organised by Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. \nThe iconic co-founder of infosys also said that he has seen the impact of not having clean cookstoves. \"I come from a family of lower middle class. My father was a high school teacher. We were 8 children. My siblings and I have watched our mother cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner using woodstove and the poor lady had to work very hard. \n\"It was very very tiring for her. We have seen her suffer,\" Murthy recalled. Pitching for government subsidies for companies that make clean energy products like cookstoves, he pointed out that businesses in India are not focusing on clean energy. \nSpeaking at the same occasion, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said the government has provided 30 million LPG connections so far and aims to provide 80 million LPG connections by 2020. \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been great believer of technology and he has directed ONGC to work towards making electric 'chullah',\" Kant said. \"40 per cent of world's population is still dependent on traditional biomasss for cooking and are exposed to indoor air pollution. It's like smoking 400 cigarettes a day,\" he added.",

      "text": "Over 5,000 administrative procedures slashed   15:31 The Hanoitimes - More than 5,000 administrative procedures were cut and simplified, making it easier for production and business, according to a Government’s report sent to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly recently. According to the report, cconsidering 2017 is the year of cutting costs for enterprises, the Prime Minister’s working team examined specialized management ministries to reduce administrative procedures and costs that still caused troublesome for firms. Right after the examination, the remaining impediments and limitations were changed positively. Taking the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) as an example, it last month decided to remove 675 out of 1,216 business and investment conditions under its management during 2017-18. The cut that was the highest-ever record in the MoIT’s history has been announced after a two-week review of business conditions in fields and sectors managed by MoIT, accounting for 55.5 percent of the total current business conditions. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has pioneered efforts to simplify investment and business conditions to facilitate business development. According to MoIT Minister Tran Tuan Anh, the streamlining of business conditions will be the core of the ministry’s administrative reform process in the coming time, aiming to improve the legal system as well as investment and business environment. After scrutinizing 27 fields and sectors under its management (excluding car manufacture and import), the MoIT has decided to ease conditions for doing business and making investment in 17 fields and sectors, including petrol and oil; gas; explosive precursors; liquor; cigarette; food; electricity; temporary import for re-export of frozen food; commercial franchise; logistics; industrial precursors; goods exchanges; commercial assessment; multi-level marketing; e-commerce; and industrial explosives (including also disposal activities). Meanwhile, investment and business conditions will be kept unchanged for the remaining 10 fields and sectors, namely activities involving the use of industrial explosives or explosive precursors; rice export; temporary import for re-export of excise tax-liable goods; temporary import for re-export of goods on the list of used goods banned or suspended from import or export; mineral trading; goods sale and purchase of FDI enterprises; oil and gas activities; energy auditing and technical inspection of machinery and equipment subject to strict requirements on occupational safety; and production of military uniforms for foreign armed forces. In a recent meeting with MoIT, Minister Mai Tien Dung, Head of the Government Office, on behalf of Prime Minister, praised the ministry’s strong determination to abrogate unnecessary investment and business procedures. Dung said that the MoIT should continue checking the list of goods to prevent overlapping management. As guided by the prime minister, each type of goods should be managed by only one specific ministry and sector. The time required for warehousing goods for customs clearance should also be reduced. Mutual recognition of inspection results should be increased among countries that have signed free trade agreements, especially among G7 countries. At the same time, he said, the MoIT should promote specialized inspections of imported food products and propose a common principle for amending legal documents. Besides the MoIT, the Ministry of Health has also started implementing risk management, moving from pre-check to post-check, the Government said.",

      "text": "New Delhi, October 24 Stepping up his attack against the government over GST, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took the Gabbar Singh analogy further by referencing the Bollywood villain’s dialogue to say it was a tax that coveted people’s earnings. Gandhi, who had on Monday described the goods and services tax as “Gabbar Singh Tax” during a rally in Gujarat, on Tuesday recalled a much-Quote: d dialogue from ‘Sholay’ to sharpen his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Congress GST=Genuine Simple Tax. Modi ji’s GST=Gabbar Singh Tax=yeh kamaai mujhe de de (give me the income),” Gandhi said on Twitter. Gabbar Singh was the name of the dacoit in the Ramesh Sippy-directed 1975 Bollywood blockbuster. The character, played by late actor Amjad Khan, says at one point of time in the film, “Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur.” (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd )\nGandhi had targeted the Centre over the issue on Monday in a rally at Gandhinagar and called for changes in the new tax regime to make it simple. :Their GST is not GST. GST means Gabbar Singh Tax. This is causing a loss to the country. Small shopkeepers are finished. Lakhs of youths have been unemployed. But they are still not ready to listen,” he had said. He had also stated that the Modi dispensation went ahead with its version of the GST despite the Congress warning the government about the tax regime’s “adverse impact”. PTI",

      "text": "Opposition to observe first anniversary of demonetisation as ‘Black Day’ PTI Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad (file pic) New Delhi, Oct 24: Several opposition parties today announced that they would observe November 8, the first anniversary of demonetisation, as ‘Black Day’ and would hold protests across the country to highlight its “ill-effects” on the economy. Announcing the decision at a joint press conference of the Opposition Coordination Committee, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad said, “This particular announcement made on November 8 is the scam of the century, which is why we are observing this as Black Day.” He described the note-ban decision as the NDA government’s “most ill-conceived and hasty decision\". “One can say this is a scam of the century. Eighteen political parties have decided to hold protests in every state in their capacity against the government’s decision which caused hardship to the people. Never ever in the world people have died because of a government policy,” Azad said. Azad, flanked by Sharad Yadav of the breakaway faction of the JD-U and TMC leader Derek O’Brien, said, “Each political party will try to give a regional name to observe this as a ’Black Day’ and will hold protests and processions.” O’Brien said his party would observe the day as “Kalo Dibas” which is ‘Black Day’ in Bengali. “History of modern India will remember the ‘scam’ which took place on November 8. We had raised a number of questions and our doubts regarding the policy but the government could not answer or erase our doubts,” he said. O’Brien also said all the 18 parties would interpret the day in different ways “in the true federal structure and will take it forward\". Asked why the Opposition was not planning a joint and united protest on the day, Azad said the Opposition had been “forced” to call November 8 as ‘Black Day’ and that the parties were united on the issue. “Since Opposition leaders from all parties, including regional ones, cannot be in Delhi. That is the reason the coordination committee has decided to have protests in every state according to the capacity of various Opposition parties. Our purpose is to show our unity,” he said. “When we raised this issue in Parliament, we visualised the problems but general public did not have apprehensions initially. All political parties were branded as if we all are corrupt and we are all black money hoarders. “This is how the Prime Minister tried to project those who opposed demonetisation. Each of them has felt the pinch and realised how much damage we have suffered due to it,” he said. The Coordination Committee of Opposition parties had met yesterday in Parliament House, where it authorised Azad to talk to other parties and finalise the protest plan on November 8. The group of 18 Opposition parties has stood together against the government and formed the seven-member coordination committee comprising leaders of the Congress, TMC, SP, BSP, DMK, the Left and the breakaway JD-U faction.

It had also told the apex court that it has an offer worth Rs 2,500 crore from a company.\"Jaiprakash Associates wants to sell off the Yamuna Expressway and deposit the money in an escrow account, a proposal which was opposed by us in the court today,\" said advocate Ashwarya Sinha, who represented the first petitioners in the case.The company also sought to give to the court the proposal to hive off the Yumuna Expressway and informing about the proposed buyer, etc, in a sealed cover.The application filed by Jaiprakash Associates and its attempt to give the proposal in a sealed cover were opposed by the Attorney General, who stared that any proposal which affected so many people could not be given in a sealed cover, according to Sinha.The Supreme Court on September 11 had asked Jaiprakash Associates to deposit Rs 2,000 crore by October 27 to pay off the aggrieved home buyers.About 32,000 home buyers were left in the lurch after the Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) on August 9 classified Jaypee Infratech , a subsidiary of Jaiprakash Associates, as insolvent on the petition filed by IDBI Bank under Section 7 of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. Jaypee had defaulted on a Rs 526-crore loan by the bank.However, the Supreme Court on September 4 stayed insolvency resolution proceedings against Jaypee Infratech on a plea by home buyers of its projects in Noida. IDBI Bank on September 5 moved the apex court demanding the stay order to be vacated.The apex court on September 11 re-initiated the insolvency resolution proceedings against Jaypee Infratech and gave its management control to the IRP, appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal, with immediate effect.The apex court has also asked the professional to submit an interim plan to SC within 45 days keeping in view the interest of homebuyers.

      "text": "NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways may soon unlock its prime residential property across the country for redevelopment, a move that could bring in additional revenue of Rs 20,000-25,000 crore for the national transporter. \n\nThe Railways owns real estate in all major cities and has swathes of residential property in Connaught Place, Nizamuddin and Chanakyapuri in New Delhi, apart from land in the heart of Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune. The plan is to grant 99-year leases to developers making compelling offers for such land, a senior Railway Board official said. \n\nThe ministry has asked all 17 zonal offices to compile details of residential land that can be redeveloped and offered to investors. The Railways has over 40,000 hectares of land, of which almost 950 hectares has been encroached upon. \n\nWork on the plan to unlock railway real estate for commercial development was started during Suresh Prabhu’s tenure as minister. Now, with Piyush Goyal taking his place, the project is being implemented with renewed interest. \n\n\n\n“We have huge residential colonies spread across the country. Railways, through builders, can redevelop the area by constructing multi-storey buildings and towers. Whatever is needed for railway requirement can be kept aside, remaining towers could be leased out,” the official said. \n\nGoyal took up the issue of redeveloping and unlocking railway land at a meeting with real estate companies last month. \n\nThe Railways is looking at the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) model. NBCC redevelops government colonies by making high-rise buildings and commercial complexes and leases part of the property to private parties, setting aside some units for government use. \n\n“We could have a similar model. The Railway Land Development Authority will be the nodal agency for all land redevelopment projects, whereas the Indian Railway Station Redevelopment Corp. will oversee the redevelopment of railway stations,” the official added. The station redevelopment project envisages building of apartments on land adjoining railway stations. The Railways is bidding out 23 stations for such redevelopment. 0 Comments",

      "text": "J&K talks: Dineshwar Sharma's appointment may take some pressure off CM, open up political space \nThe Delhi government will use the services of retired principals and vice-principals to take care of the nodal centres, meant for Vishwas group students appearing for Class X board exams from the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). Vishwas group students are those who have repeatedly failed in classes IX and X. This year, the government has decided to set up 163 study centres in government schools under the Directorate of Education across Delhi, where regular classes will be held at these study centres. \nLast year, each school had their own Vishwas group students and they attended regular classes. They had appeared as private candidates in the Class X boards and had failed in large numbers. Out of 163, as many as 34 nodal centres each for boys and girls will be initially set up which will coordinate all the activities related to the programme \nSo the retired principals/vice principals will be employed as co-ordinators and in-charge of the nodal centres. They will be employed on a contractual basis. Their duty will be to get the students registered with NIOS (online and offline), to monitor and maintain enrolment records. They will also have to keep in touch with the parents and counsel them and their wards to enroll in these study centres. Video of the day   More Top News",

No arrest has been made so far.Around 12.30am, Arif received a phone call and went out of the house while talking on the phone.Later his father heard gun shots and rushed out to see two people running away, Singla said.Arif’s body was later found near the house and the family informed police.The body has been shifted to GTB Hospital for autopsy.Separately, a Class 4 student collapsed and fell unconscious on Monday after an angry teacher flung an object at him that hit him in the groin in a Ghaziabad town. The still-unconscious nine-year-old, whose offence was he had entered the Staff Room when they were resting by mistake, was then thrown in an open field, police said.The incident occurred in BK Major Public School, Mustafabad Loni, a tehsil town of Ghaziabad bordering Delhi.The police said the student Samir, son of Noor Mohammad, entered the Staff Room during zero hour without permission. At that time the teachers were resting and gossiping. Angered at student’s sudden appearance in the room and in a fit of rage, one of the teachers flung an object at him that hit him in the crotch.As the student collapsed and became unconscious, the teachers called other students and asked them to throw him in the open field opposite the school. The student remained in the field for about half an hour after which he was taken to the local Global Nursing Home by other students. The students made a call to the police which did not act. Doctors said the boy was still unconscious, at the time of filing of this report.The boy’s father, Noor Mohammad, alleged that the school’s teachers are violent by nature. His elder son was also beaten by the teachers in the past.The District Inspector of Schools (DIOS) said the school does not figure in the list of recognized schools in the area.

A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra considered the report of advocate Gaurav Agarawal, who is assisting it as an amicus curiae, which said that out of several home buyers of Supertech’s twin Emerald Towers, 26 have not received any refund. The bench, which also comprised Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, said that Rs 20 crore has been deposited with the apex court registry by the prominent real estate firm and the money would be used in paying back the principal amount to the home buyers who have received nothing in refund. It also asked Amicus Curiae Agarawal to assist in disbursal. The court said the issue of interest and the deduction of return on investment (RoI) from the principal, payable to home buyers, would be dealt with at later stage. Advocates Akhilesh Kumar Pandey and Shoeb Alam, appearing for some home buyers, said the interest of the hassled home buyers needed to be protected. The bench, which had asked the amicus curiae to set up a web portal to deal with grievances of home buyers on September 22, said that Rs two lakh be paid to him towards expenses incurred in setting up of the portal. It posted for December 4 the final disposal of appeals of Supertech filed against the Allahabad High Court’s April 11, 2014 verdict ordering demolition of the twin towers–Apex and Ceyane– and directing the realty major to refund money to home buyers with 14 per cent interest in three months. Earlier, the top court had asked the home buyers to register and lodge their grievances on the web portal set up by the amicus curiae. It had asked the amicus curiae to include in the web portal the entire details of home buyers of these twin towers and the money paid by them and refunds made by the firm. The real estate firm had said it had deposited Rs 20 crore with the apex court registry for refunding money to the home buyers who did not want flats. The apex court, on August 14, had asked Supertech to deposit Rs 10 crore for refunding money to the investors. Penal action In an important verdict, the Supreme Court Monday ordered refund of principal amount of 26 home buyers who had booked flats in a Supertech project at Noida in Uttar Pradesh The apex court, on August 14, had asked Supertech to deposit Rs 10 crore for refunding money to the investors who wanted to opt out of the project Share this Post:",

An acknowledgement for receipt of the complaint has been issued. No first information report (FIR) had been lodged,\" a police official in Anna Nagar police station in Madurai told IANS over phone on Monday. \nTemple town Madurai is around 500 km from Chennai. \nMersal is in the midst of a controversy after the Tamil Nadu unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded the removal of certain dialogues which take a dig at the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Digital India. \nDirected by Atlee, Mersal stars Vijay in the roles of a village head, a doctor and a magician. It is doing brisk business at the box office. \nBJP's National Secretary H. Raja and Tamil Nadu BJP President Tamilisai Soundararajan criticised Vijay and the movie for the dialogues critical of GST and Digital India. \nThe BJP leaders said the dialogues were factually incorrect. \nIn a tweet on Monday, Soundararajan said like the freedom to express views, one has the freedom to rebut wrong views. \nRaja, who raked up the actor's Christian origin by his tweet \"Joseph Vijay's hatred for Modi is Mersal \" on October 21, continued that on Monday. \nHe uploaded the actor's voter identity card and a letter written by the actor to a magazine on his letter pad. \n\"Truth is bitter,\" tweeted Raja on Monday uploading the two documents to underscore Vijay's religion. \nVijay, who had met Narendra Modi during electioneering ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, had even lauded demonetisation last year.",

Further, the green panel asked both the authorities to show cause regarding the same within 10 days. \nThe Bench headed by NGT chairperson Swatanter Kumar met officials from the State government, Delhi Development Authority (DDA), DJB, Larsen and Toubro and National Mission for Clean Ganga in the NGT premises. \nDefying orders \nMr. Kumar pulled up the authorities for defying the orders that were earlier passed by the tribunal and said that except for shifting blame, the authorities had no other reason to explain their ‘in-action and non-cooperation’ towards the project. \nSewage treatment plants \nThe green panel also rapped the DJB for not setting up the sewage treatment plants that were required. \nReplying to the Bench regarding the same, the counsel appearing for the DJB said that necessary proceedings will be initiated and that the delay was because of certain decision-making processes by the board. \nDDA counsel \nThe counsel appearing for the DDA, on the other hand, said that they had complied with the NGT orders and were also releasing the money that the DJB had asked for. \nPhase-I of the Clean Yamuna Project dealt with lowering the pollution levels in the Najafgarh and Delhi Gate drains, while Phase-II dealt with Shahdara, Barapullah and other drain systems. \nIn the previous order, the green panel had also asked as to why ‘appropriate orders in relation to attachment of their accounts be not passed and the proceedings for non-compliance of the orders of the tribunal be not initiated’. \nIt had said that the pollution in the Yamuna was a serious concern as industrial effluents contaminated it highly. \nThe DJB is now expected to file a detailed reply within 10 days.",

      "text": "NEW DELHI: State-run ITI Ltd has emerged as the lowest bidder for 50 lakh smart meters quoting a rate of Rs 2,503 per unit, followed by Genus Power and KEONICS in a reverse auction by EESL.\nEarlier this month, L&T had quoted the lowest price for smart meters at Rs 2,722 per unit, which was 40-50 per cent lower than the current market price.\nState-run Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) has achieved a further price reduction in the procurement of 50 lakh smart meters on the basis of a reverse auction of the tender conducted last week, a Power Ministry statement said.\nAccording to the statement, ITI has emerged as the lowest bidder (L1 bidder) in this reverse auction, followed by Genus Power and KEONICS.\nITI quoted the lowest price of Rs 2,503 per unit. Now the total procurement cost of 50 lakh units has been reduced by Rs 132 crore due to reverse auction.\nThe bidding has brought the price down from Rs 2,722 to Rs 2,503 per smart meter which is a reduction of 8 per cent from the previous tender quote, it said.\nA total of seven companies were invited for the reverse auction. The lower price will further benefit the end consumers.\nAs per the government guidelines, EESL will invite Genus Power (L2) and KEONICS (L3) to match the L1 price.\nIt further said after L2 and L3 match the L1 price, the EESL will split the procurement of a single metre between three parties in the ratio of 50:30:20.\nThe meters will be installed over a period of three years in a phased manner in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana .\nThe procurement conducted by the EESL, which comes under Ministry of Power, is the world s largest single smart meter procurement. As many as 40 lakh such meters will be deployed in UP and the remaining 10 lakh in Haryana.\nSmart meters are a part of the overall Advanced Metering Infrastructure Solutions (AMI) aimed at better demand response designed to reduce energy consumption during peak hours.\nThe overall AMI solution will also have a system integrator who will be responsible for meter installation, data storage on cloud, preparing dashboards, etc. The bids for the system integrator are expected to open on October 31, 2017.\nEESL is procuring smart meters and services of the system integrator with 100 per cent investment and the utilities will make zero-investment.\nThe repayment to EESL will be through savings resulting from enhanced billing efficiency, avoided meter reading costs, etc.\nIt is said the average cost of meter reading is Rs 40 per meter, which will be completely avoided. 0 Comments",

      "text": "New Delhi, October 24 Stepping up his attack against the government over GST, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took the Gabbar Singh analogy further by referencing the Bollywood villain’s dialogue to say it was a tax that coveted people’s earnings. Gandhi, who had on Monday described the goods and services tax as “Gabbar Singh Tax” during a rally in Gujarat, on Tuesday recalled a much-Quote: d dialogue from ‘Sholay’ to sharpen his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Congress GST=Genuine Simple Tax. Modi ji’s GST=Gabbar Singh Tax=yeh kamaai mujhe de de (give me the income),” Gandhi said on Twitter. Gabbar Singh was the name of the dacoit in the Ramesh Sippy-directed 1975 Bollywood blockbuster. The character, played by late actor Amjad Khan, says at one point of time in the film, “Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur.” (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd )\nGandhi had targeted the Centre over the issue on Monday in a rally at Gandhinagar and called for changes in the new tax regime to make it simple. :Their GST is not GST. GST means Gabbar Singh Tax. This is causing a loss to the country. Small shopkeepers are finished. Lakhs of youths have been unemployed. But they are still not ready to listen,” he had said. He had also stated that the Modi dispensation went ahead with its version of the GST despite the Congress warning the government about the tax regime’s “adverse impact”. PTI",

      "text": "Opposition to observe first anniversary of demonetisation as ‘Black Day’ PTI Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad (file pic) New Delhi, Oct 24: Several opposition parties today announced that they would observe November 8, the first anniversary of demonetisation, as ‘Black Day’ and would hold protests across the country to highlight its “ill-effects” on the economy. Announcing the decision at a joint press conference of the Opposition Coordination Committee, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad said, “This particular announcement made on November 8 is the scam of the century, which is why we are observing this as Black Day.” He described the note-ban decision as the NDA government’s “most ill-conceived and hasty decision\". “One can say this is a scam of the century. Eighteen political parties have decided to hold protests in every state in their capacity against the government’s decision which caused hardship to the people. Never ever in the world people have died because of a government policy,” Azad said. Azad, flanked by Sharad Yadav of the breakaway faction of the JD-U and TMC leader Derek O’Brien, said, “Each political party will try to give a regional name to observe this as a ’Black Day’ and will hold protests and processions.” O’Brien said his party would observe the day as “Kalo Dibas” which is ‘Black Day’ in Bengali. “History of modern India will remember the ‘scam’ which took place on November 8. We had raised a number of questions and our doubts regarding the policy but the government could not answer or erase our doubts,” he said. O’Brien also said all the 18 parties would interpret the day in different ways “in the true federal structure and will take it forward\". Asked why the Opposition was not planning a joint and united protest on the day, Azad said the Opposition had been “forced” to call November 8 as ‘Black Day’ and that the parties were united on the issue. “Since Opposition leaders from all parties, including regional ones, cannot be in Delhi. That is the reason the coordination committee has decided to have protests in every state according to the capacity of various Opposition parties. Our purpose is to show our unity,” he said. “When we raised this issue in Parliament, we visualised the problems but general public did not have apprehensions initially. All political parties were branded as if we all are corrupt and we are all black money hoarders. “This is how the Prime Minister tried to project those who opposed demonetisation. Each of them has felt the pinch and realised how much damage we have suffered due to it,” he said. The Coordination Committee of Opposition parties had met yesterday in Parliament House, where it authorised Azad to talk to other parties and finalise the protest plan on November 8. The group of 18 Opposition parties has stood together against the government and formed the seven-member coordination committee comprising leaders of the Congress, TMC, SP, BSP, DMK, the Left and the breakaway JD-U faction.

According to a statement issued by the state government here yesterday, the chief minister said this at a public meeting in Chitrakoot. He also promised that Chitrakoot would be linked to a highway, and observed that the district was extremely important from cultural and security angles and a work plan should be devised for its planned development. \n“To attract tourists, Kalinjar Fort (in Banda district) and Rani Lakshmibai’s Fort in Jhansi will be developed. The state government will extend its full support and also seek support from the Centre,” he said. Adityanath also laid the foundation stone of the Ramayan Gallery and Tourism Facilitation Centre at Ramghat. “The state government is making every effort to usher in happiness in the lives of the people of Bundelkhand,” he said. \nAdityanath distributed certificates to beneficiaries of various schemes and undertook a surprise inspection of the district hospital. Later, chairing a review meeting of law and order and development works, he said, “Action should be taken under the provisions of the Goondas Act and the Gangsters Act against land mafia, mining mafia, dreaded criminals and those involved in smuggling of animals and illegal trade of tendu leaves.” He also issued directives for effective control of crimes committed against women.

The injured victims were being treated at a state-run hospital. \nEvery day, thousands of Indians take short cuts across railway tracks, but this can prove deadly. \nNearly 28,000 people were killed in accidents along tracks in 2014, mostly run down by speeding trains, the latest data from India's crime records bureau shows. \nIndia's railways transport nearly 23 million passengers every day. But critics say the creaking British-era network is inefficient, overburdened and unsafe. More about",

      "text": "India's utility scale solar capacity addition to slow down to 6GW \nPower surplus will hurt its current peak of 8GW. \nThe Indian solar market is being tested to its limits. GST has increased execution costs. According to Bridge to India, module prices have shot up when bidders were factoring in another 20% price decline by the end of this year. Chinese module suppliers are even reluctant to supply to India. \nThe government is considering anti-dumping duty petition to support domestic solar manufacturers. But perhaps, the biggest challenge facing the sector is slowing power demand. Lack of visibility over project pipeline is forcing developers to bid aggressive tariffs and reconsider strategic options including consolidation. \nIt is therefore relevant to ask what does the future pipeline scenario look like? \nHere's what Bridge to India has to say: \nSeven states – Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab – together make up over 80% of India’s total installed and pipeline capacity of 27 GW. \nOther states continue to lag and progress is expected to be slow because of surplus power situation in the country. \nAfter peaking at about 8 GW in 2017, India’s utility scale solar capacity addition is expected to stabilize at a much lower level of 5-6 GW per annum for next few years; The ten largest states in India have power consumption greater than 50 billion units each and together, they account for 75% of India’s total power demand. \nThese states, located mainly in central and southern India, should also account for bulk of solar power demand in the country. Five of these states – Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Rajasthan – have led the sector growth so far and tied up more than 3 GW of solar capacity each. \nMadhya Pradesh and Punjab have tied up another 2 GW and 1 GW respectively. These seven states together make up for over 80% of India’s total installed and pipeline capacity of 27 GW. \nThey have front-loaded their solar power demand and are well ahead of their annual targets determined by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Solar activity in these states is inevitably expected to slow down going forward and indeed, some of them are already cancelling ongoing tenders. \nIn contrast, combined installed and tendered pipeline capacity of the three largest power consuming states, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, is lower than that of Karnataka on a stand-alone basis. \nIn May 2017, we predicted that Uttar Pradesh could be a dark horse for India’s new solar allocations. Since then, it has issued a 750 MW tender under SECI scheme and is believed to be considering further tenders. Maharashtra’s power consumption is almost three times that of Andhra Pradesh but its installed solar capacity is just one-third in comparison. Gujarat, a solar frontrunner back in 2012-13, is also lagging way behind. It added a paltry 211 MW in the last two years against almost 1 GW in neighbouring Rajasthan and 2 GW in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. \nUnfortunately, the prevailing power surplus situation in India suggests that slowdown in solar power demand may continue for 3-4 years. We expect India’s utility scale solar capacity addition to peak in the current year (at about 8 GW) and then stabilize at a much lower 5-6 GW per annum for the next 2-3 years. Rooftop solar is expected to, however, provide some relief by continuing to grow at a healthy rate and becoming a 3 GW per annum market by 2020.",

The top leadership has approved four pilot national parks in the Sanjiangyuan region (the source of three rivers - the Yangtze, the Yellow and the Lancang) and Qilian Mountain. The area in total covers 215,000 square kilometers, said Yang Weimin, deputy head of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economic Affairs, the country's top economic policy-making office at a news conference on Monday afternoon. \"It means 2 percent of national territory will be saved for the rare species and to keep it clean for future generations, an unprecedented effort in history,\" he added at the news conference on the sidelines of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China when introducing the achievements in ecological civilization. Yang said in the past there were many departments to manage a vast number of natural reserves, but in many cases management methods could be enhanced. Source: china daily",

Quota spearhead Hardik Patel can play the role of kingmaker in the state as he commands considerable influence over Patidar community of the state. By: Anurag Kumar || Updated: 24 Oct 2017 09:57 AM Image: Hardik Patel/ Twitter - - - - - - - - - Advertisement - - - - - - - - - New Delhi: Gujarat Assembly elections are just around the corner and political activity has gained momentum in the state with Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting the home state thrice in October and more than five times this year. Not far behind the PM, the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi (who is all set to become president of the party) has also visited the state quite frequently recently. The Election Commission is yet to announced the dates for the Assembly elections in Gujarat and parties are trying to using the time in their favour. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been in power for the last two decades in Gujarat with Modi himself being the CM of the state before becoming the PM. Screen grab: Google maps A third player in Gujarat Interestingly, in Gujarat, in addition to BJP and Congress, there is a third player-- Hardik Patel --(who is giving an additional boost to the political motion). Quota spearhead Hardik Patel can play the role of kingmaker in the state as he commands considerable influence over Patidar community of the state. There are also reports doing rounds that Hardik Patel met Rahul Gandhi in a hotel in Ahmedabad on Monday. However, denial came immediately. In an exclusive interview to ABP Live's Anurag Kumar, Hardik Patel in May 2017, had hinted that he may support Congress party. EXCLUSIVE: Modi only 'burst balloons in air'; BJP won't win more than 60 seats in Gujarat, says Hardik Patel Recently, again he hinted the same to the channel. \"Congress is better than BJP,\" Hardik Patel said in an exclusive conversation with ABP News channel, on Sunday. Patidars, reportedly, represents 12.3% of the population of Gujarat and Hardik Patel with his oratorical skills commands significant influence over them. Anti-incumbency plus support for Congress plus Patidar factor may turn the table in favour of the Congress party. If Congress, by chance, with the support of Patidars comes to power, it will going to be a big blow for the ruling BJP, given the fact that General elections are also scheduled to take place in 2019. The result of Gujarat Assembly elections will definitely affect the result of the General election of 2019. And even if Congress fails to come to power, it appears, that the grand old party is all set to give a tough fight. Continous visits of Rahul Gandhi to the state is a proof of that. Whatever will be the result, it will be interesting to watch.

      "text": "0 82 \nISLAMABAD: Never in the country’s history has Pakistan faced a worse crisis than the one it faces today, former PML-N leader Javed Hashmi said in a characteristically well-timed press conference on Monday. \nThe press conference was called by him to share insights on Pakistan’s political and constitutional struggles, his own struggles for democracy and his brief stint with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).“This is a land that works without a constitution,” Hashmi said at the start of the presser hosted in Islamabad. Criticising the manner in which the 1956 and 1973 constitutions were formulated, he said the “civil and military powers alter the constitution at will”. He added that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto ran the country into a state of emergency.“Then came Ziaul Haq, who himself was the constitution,” he said.“We could not become a nation which respects its constitution,” he said, claiming that the country has never seen a worse crisis in its 70-year history than the one it sees today. Talking about the role of the Supreme Court, Hashmi said: “The Supreme Court has caused more destruction in the country than any other institution.” He alleged that the court had allowed former president and military dictator Pervez Musharraf to change the constitution, although he had “broken” the Constitution twice. However, he clarified that he was not criticising incumbent Supreme Court justices. “I know that if I say anything about the current SC, it will amount to contempt of court,” he noted. “The current chief justice [of Pakistan] publicly kissed my hand, how can I say something against him?” Hashmi asked. He said many SC judges swore to get plots but again clarified that he was not talking about the current judges, who he said, were saints. SHARE",

      "text": "US needs to work with others on North Korea crisis: PM Lee US needs to work with others on North Korea crisis: PM Lee By - October 24, 2017 US President Donald Trump and Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong deliver joint statements to reporters in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, October 23, 2017. Reuters \nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for President Donald Trump his country’s efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program but also advised the US leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict. \n“There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary, but so is dialogue,” Lee said in remarks with Trump at the White House. “The US will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia, to resolve the issue.” \nHe urged Trump to build a good relationship with China, noting that Singapore and other countries in the region “watch your relations with China very closely” and see it as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world.” \nA senior White House official also said US President Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure North Korea when he visits China next month, stepping up a strategy to have Beijing help rein in Pyongyang. \nIsolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. \nTrump will call on Xi to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea. \nChina, North Korea’s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. \nChina has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. \nBut a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump’s trip said China needs to do more to comply with two U.N. Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China’s support. \n“We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those U.N. Security Council resolutions,” the official said. \nThough China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. \nChina’s special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his US counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said, where they had a “deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue”. The ministry did not elaborate. \nTrump, who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nBut this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan. \n‘CRITICAL’ THREAT \nThe threat from North Korea has grown to a “critical and imminent level” and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his US and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday. \nOnodera’s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. \nThe White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff. \nAsked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a US envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said: “There’s nothing planned.” \nWith Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week. \nTrump’s Nov. 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. \nTrump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the US trade deficit with China, the White House official said. \n“We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,” the official said. \nDespite Trump’s fierce criticism of China’s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea. \nChina has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbor. \nEven as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to US demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang.

      "text": "* Spotlight on little-known counterterrorism operation\n* Dunford: No initial signs soldiers took too many risks\n* McCain: Formal hearing expected Thursday (Adds more from news conference, background, McCain comment)\nBy Idrees Ali\nWASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer sought on Monday to tamp down criticism the Pentagon had not been forthcoming about the death of four U.S. soldiers in an ambush in Niger, providing a timeline of the incident and acknowledging unanswered questions remained.\nGeneral Joseph Dunford, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the United States Africa Command was conducting an investigation into the Oct. 4 attack. Some lawmakers have criticized the Pentagon for being slow to provide answers.\nDunford acknowledged that a number of issues were still under investigation, including why U.S. forces on the ground waited an hour until they called for support, what type of intelligence was used in the mission and why it took as long as it did to recover a U.S. soldier's body.\n\"There has been a lot of speculation about the operation in Niger and there's a perception that the Department of Defense has not been forthcoming and I thought it would be helpful for me to personally clarify to you what we know today, and to outline what we hope to find out in the ongoing investigation,\" Dunford said in an hour-long news conference.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers has been criticized by lawmakers in Washington and has raised the profile of the deadly incident.\nDunford said for the first time that U.S. forces on the ground in Niger waited an hour before calling for support.\nWithin minutes, a U.S. drone located nearby was moved over the firefight and provided intelligence and full-motion video.\nFrench fighter jets arrived above the scene about an hour after that, said Dunford.\n\"It is important to note that when they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgment would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support,\" Dunford said.\nThe French fighters did not drop bombs when they arrived, something Dunford said was under investigation.\n\nQUESTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS\nRepublican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said last week he may consider issuing a subpoena because the White House had not been forthcoming with details of the attack.\nOn Monday, McCain said lawmakers were getting cooperation and information from the Pentagon and expected a \"formal hearing\" on Thursday about the ambush.\nThe attack threw a spotlight on the little-known counterterrorism mission in the West African country, which has about 800 U.S. troops, out of a total of 6,000 U.S. troops in Africa. The United States says it is there to support Niger in fighting Islamist extremists.\nThe Pentagon said at the time that three soldiers had been killed in the ambush. The body of a fourth soldier, Sergeant La David Johnson, was recovered about two days later.\nDunford said that on Oct. 3, a dozen U.S. soldiers accompanied 30 Nigerien forces on a reconnaissance mission near the village of Tongo Tongo.\nAfter spending the night near the village, the forces were moving back to their base when they came under attack from about 50 enemy fighters, who appeared to be from a local Islamic State affiliate. The militants attacked with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades, Dunford said.\n\"It was planned as a reconnaissance mission,\" Dunford said. \"What happened after they began to execute, in other words, did the mission change? That is one of the questions that's being asked,\" he said.\n\nCONSIDERED A LOWER-RISK MISSION\nThe mission had been seen as a relatively lower-risk endeavor for elite U.S. commandos and there was no armed air cover at the time that could carry out air strikes if necessary.\nHe added there was no indication the soldiers had taken too many risks.\n\"I don't have any indication right now to believe or to know that they did anything other than operate within the orders they were given,\" Dunford said.\nU.S. forces were conducting normal operations in Niger again and the plan was for them to continue to train and advise local partners. Dunford said there had been no discussions about increasing U.S. troops.\nA controversy has swirled for a week over how Trump has handled the task of consoling relatives of slain service members.\nMyeshia Johnson, the widow of the Army sergeant killed in Niger, said on Monday that Trump had \"made me cry even worse\" in a condolence call when he said her husband \"knew what he signed up for.\"\n\"We owe the families as much information as we can find out about what happened, and we owe the American people an explanation of what their men and women were doing at this particular time,\" Dunford said.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Additional reporting by David Alexander, Eric Walsh and Amanda Becker; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Peter Cooney)",

      "text": "By Valerie Volcovici\nWASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. federal government should adopt a strategy to manage climate change risks, as their cost to the government may rise as much as $35 billion per year by mid-century, a congressional watchdog office report released on Monday said. The report from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office comes as Congress weighs aid packages for U.S. victims of deadly hurricanes and wildfires that struck in 2017, with losses already estimated at more than $300 billion.\nPresident Donald Trump, a climate change doubter, rolled back Obama administration directives requiring federal agencies to prepare plans to address climate risks in March, and agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency have cut climate change research.\nThe report was written at the request of Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, who asked for a comprehensive study on the costs and risks to the U.S. government from climate change in November 2015.\n\"Climate change impacts are already costing the federal government money, and these costs will likely increase over time as the climate continues to change,\" the report said.\nExtreme weather and fire events have cost the federal government over $350 billion over the last decade, the report said, citing the Office of Management and Budget.\nPreliminary government estimates of the economic losses of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the wildfires in nine western states combined this year alone are poised to exceed $300 billion.\n\"Our government cannot afford to spend more than $300 billion each year in response to severe weather events that are connected to warming waters, which produce stronger hurricanes,\" said Maine Senator Collins.\nCantwell, lead Democratic on the Senate energy committee, whose home state Washington was affected by wildfires, said the report warns that the federal government will need to pay \"trillions more in the future unless we mitigate the impacts.\"\nThe GAO recommended that White House executive offices, including the Office of Science and Technology Policy, use available economic reports to \"craft appropriate federal responses.\"\nThe president has not appointed a chief scientific policy officer.\nThe report said the government should use available national economic studies that have attempted to quantify the economic effects of climate change, including the American Climate Prospectus study and the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis.\n\"Several experts we interviewed noted that even though the methods produce imprecise results, they can convey useful insight into broad themes about potential climate damages across sectors in the United States,\" the report said. The American Climate Prospectus study, for example, said the Southeast, Midwest and Great Plains regions will likely experience greater combined economic effects from climate change than other regions, due to coastal property damage in the Southeast and crop yield changes in the Midwest and Great Plains.

You can play multiplayer games with these titles across console types, but only in System Link mode.\n\"Now there are other players with nuclear competence\", Goldfein said, pointing out that the world is not a bipolar place where the main actors are only the USA and the Soviet Union.\nThe decision was made against the backdrop of \"the rapid development of North Korea's nuclear arsenal\", according to David Goldfein and other senior USA military officials Quote: d by the newspaper, which in turn 'do not hesitate to emphasize President Trump's hawkish approach to Pyongyang.' The rise in Russian military potential is also cited. \"It's never been more important to make sure that we get this mission right\".\nIn a report by security news website Defense One , Air Force chief of staff Gen. David Goldfein said the military was considering the move in light of rising tensions with North Korea.\nHe said: \"I've challenged Air Force Global Strike Command to help lead the dialogue, help with this discussion about 'What does conventional conflict look like with a nuclear element?' and 'Do we respond as a global force if that were to occur?' and 'What are the options?'\". He also asked his team to think of innovative ways a nuclear weapon can be used, either for deterrence or combat.\nPollution-related deaths in India rank among the highest globally, study reveals\nMost of these nine million deaths occur from pollution-related diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and lung-cancer. Other nations with deadly environments include Haiti , Bangladesh, South Sudan, Pakistan and North Korea .\nBarksdale Air Force base in northwestern Louisiana is the home of Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all nuclear forces the Air Force has under it's command. Still, at least one tangible sign of the potential move is in motion: The building where B-52 crews slept during the Cold War is being renovated, notes Defense One .\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later asserted that the diplomatic efforts to relax tensed relations with North Korea would continue \"until the first bomb drops\".\nThe situation on the Korean Peninsula has grown progressively tenser as Pyongyang has continued to launch a missile and nuclear tests, in spite of warnings of the global community and, in particular, the United States.\nEuropean Union leaders meeting in Brussels to issue statement on Iran nuclear deal\nHe is also determined to confront Iran's meddling in neighbouring states. He called on Europe to actively oppose Mr Trump's position. They had lobbied the administration hard and lost.",

      "text": "Abe targets N Korea after win AFP . Tokyo | Update: 11:20, Oct 23, 2017 0 Like \nPrime minister Shinzo Abe stormed to a landslide “super-majority” in snap Japanese elections, near complete projections showed Monday, with the hardline nationalist immediately pledging to “deal firmly” with North Korea. \nAbe’s conservative coalition is on track to win at least 312 seats with only a handful left to call, according to public broadcaster NHK, giving him a coveted two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament. \nThat will allow him to pursue his cherished goal of proposing changes to the country’s pacifist constitution to beef up the status of the military, which is effectively restricted to self-defence. \nAbe, 63, is now on course to become Japan’s longest-serving premier, winning a fresh term at the helm of the world’s third-biggest economy and key US regional ally. \nThe hawkish prime minister said the crushing election victory had hardened his resolve to deal with the crisis in North Korea, which has threatened to “sink” Japan into the sea and fired two missiles over its northern islands. \n“As I promised in the election, my imminent task is to firmly deal with North Korea. For that, strong diplomacy is required,” stressed Abe, who has courted both US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n‘Some concerns’ about Abe \nHowever, while local media acknowledged what was described as a “landslide” victory, many chalked up Abe’s win to a weak and ineffective opposition and urged caution. \n“The voters didn’t think the opposition parties were capable of running a government... they chose Prime Minister Abe, who is at least better, even if they had some concerns about the ruling coalition,” said the Nikkei daily. \nThe Asahi newspaper said: “The Abe brand is not as strong as it was before. There are some signs that voters are seeking a change in the situation whereby Abe is the only decent option.” \n“Winning an election in a democracy doesn’t give the winner carte-blanche and he would be overconfident if he thought people were satisfied with the past five years of government management,” said the paper. \nAccording to an exit poll by Kyodo News on Sunday, 51 percent of voters said they do not trust Abe with 44 percent saying they did. \nTurnout was expected to be only a fraction higher than all-time low set in the 2014 election and was boosted largely by people voting early to avoid a typhoon, which smashed into Japan on election day. \nThe opposition Party of Hope, formed only weeks before the election by the popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, suffered a drubbing. It won just 49 seats according to the NHK projections. \nA chastened Koike, speaking thousands of kilometres away in Paris where she was attending an event in her capacity as leader of the world’s biggest city, said it was a “very severe result” for which she took full responsibility. \nThe new centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party out-performed Koike’s new group but still trailed far behind Abe with 54 seats. \n“People are reluctant about Prime Minister Abe, but then who would you turn to? There is no one,” said Naoto Nonaka, professor at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. \n‘Deepen constitution debate’ \nAbe, who has in the past been criticised for an arrogant attitude towards voters, vowed to face the challenge posed by the victory “humbly.” \nHe struck a cautious note on possible revisions to the US-imposed constitution, saying that he would “deepen” debate in parliament on the divisive issue but not seek to ram anything through. \n“I don’t plan to propose (changes) via the ruling bloc alone. We’ll make efforts to gain support from as many people as possible.” \nAny changes to the document must be ratified by both chambers of parliament and then in a referendum, with surveys showing voters are split on the topic. \nMany voters stressed that the economy is their biggest concern, as the prime minister’s trademark “Abenomics” strategy of ultra-loose monetary policy and huge government spending has failed to rekindle the former Asian powerhouse. \nAbe has vowed to use the proceeds from a planned sales tax hike to fund free childcare in a bid to get more women into the workforce. \n“Neither pensions nor wages are getting better... I don’t feel the economy is recovering at all,” said 67-year-old pensioner Hideki Kawasaki as he cast his vote in a rain-swept Tokyo. \nBut investors cheered the victory, with the benchmark Tokyo index up 1.15 percent, extending a winning run that has seen 14 straight consecutive gains—the first since 1961.",

      "text": "Print Article \nMelania Trump poses after the Republican US presidential candidates debate sponsored by ABC News at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire February 6, 2016. — Reuters pic CHICAGO, Oct 24 — Donald Trump’s detractors may label him one of the world’s most powerful bullies, but that did not discourage America’s first lady from championing the fight against bullying at a Detroit area school yesterday. \nMelania Trump has publicly embraced the anti-bullying cause at the risk of drawing unfavorable parallels with a president who routinely resorts to brutal personal attacks and name-calling both on and off social media. \n“I think it’s important that we choose kindness and compassion,” she told students at Orchard Lake Middle School, in a Detroit suburb, during a visit made as part of National Bullying Prevention Month. \n“I encourage you to find a new friend,” the first lady told the children. \n“Ask them what they like, what their hobbies are, so nobody becomes sad or stressed and everybody feels included.” \nMelania Trump, the mother of the president’s youngest child, 11-year-old Barron, pledged during the 2016 campaign to make the fight against bullying a priority as first lady, and addressed the issue during a speech at the United Nations in September. \nBut her choice of a cause to champion has consistently raised eyebrows. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump displayed a propensity to attack personal traits of his opponents — be it their stature, ethnic origin or even in one notorious case the physical disability of a reporter — and since taking office has been regularly accused of using the presidency as a bully pulpit. \nTo hammer the point home, the Washington Post ran an annotated version of Melania Trump’s statement yesterday’s visit — linking to more than a dozen tweets in which Trump variously labelled his opponents with the terms “loser”, “idiot”, “dummy”, “failed”, “moron” and “dope”. — AFP",

      "text": "Tokyo: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stormed to a landslide “super-majority” in snap Japanese elections, near complete projections showed, with the hardline nationalist immediately pledging to “deal firmly” with North Korea.\nAbe’s conservative coalition is on track to win at least 312 seats with only a handful left to call, according to public broadcaster NHK, giving him a coveted two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament.\nThat will allow him to pursue his cherished goal of proposing changes to the country’s pacifist constitution to beef up the status of the mili­tary, which is effectively restricted to self-defence.\nAbe, 63, is now on course to become Japan’s longest-serving premier, winning a fresh term at the helm of the world’s third biggest economy and key US regional ally.\nThe hawkish prime minister said the crushing election victory had hardened his resolve to deal with the crisis in North Korea, which has threatened to “sink” Japan into the sea and fired two missiles over its northern islands.\n“As I promised in the election, my imminent task is to firmly deal with North Korea. For that, strong diplomacy is required,” stressed Abe, who has courted both US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nHowever, while local media acknowledged what was described as a “landslide” victory, many chalked up Abe’s win to a weak and ineffective opposition and urged caution.\n“The voters didn’t think the opposition parties were capable of running a government... they chose Prime Minister Abe, who is at least better, even if they had some concerns about the ruling coalition,” said the Nikkei daily. \nThe Asahi newspaper said: “The Abe brand is not as strong as it was before. There are some signs that voters are seeking a change in the situation whereby Abe is the only decent option.\n“Winning an election in a democracy doesn’t give the winner carte-blanche and he would be overconfident if he thought people were satisfied with the past five years of government management.”\nAccording to an exit poll by Kyodo News on Sunday, 51% of voters said they do not trust Abe, with 44% saying they did.\nTurnout was expected to be only a fraction higher than the all-time low set in the 2014 election and was boosted largely by people voting early to avoid a typhoon, which smashed into Japan on election day.\nThe opposition Party of Hope, formed only weeks before the election by the popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, suffered a drubbing. It won just 49 seats according to the NHK projections. — AFP",

      "text": "Bautista's impeachment case declared moot Tuesday, October 24, 2017 \nMANILA. Commission on Elections Chairman Andres Bautista (SunStar Philippines file photo/Al Padilla) \nMANILA (Updated) -- The House committee on justice declared moot and academic on Tuesday, October 24, the impeachment complaint against Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman Juan Andres Bautista. \nMindoro Oriental Representative Reynaldo Umali, panel chair, said President Rodrigo Duterte's acceptance of Bautista's offer to resign mooted the impeachment process against the Comelec chair. \nOn October 11, Bautista submitted a resignation letter effective December 31, citing the need to prioritize his family, but the President officially accepted it on Monday, October 23. \n\"The Palace has accepted the resignation of Commission on Elections' Chairman Andres Bautista effective immediately,\" Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said. \nHe said the six remaining Comelec commissioners, in the meantime, can appoint the poll agency's officer-in-charge. \n\"As an independent commission, the Comelec will resolve among its remaining commissioners as to who will be the officer in charge, until such time the President appoints the new chair,\" Abella added. \nHe said the President has yet to appoint a new chairman of Comelec. \nDuterte in an earlier interview said that it was not necessary to oust Bautista since the latter already decided to resign. \nBautista said Monday that he got the news from Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea informing him that the President had accepted his resignation \"effective immediately.\" \nThe House panel was supposed to tackle the Articles of Impeachment against Bautista after the House of Representatives voted to proceed with the impeachment complaint against the poll chief for culpable violation of the Constitution and betrayal of public trust. \nMajority of the House members voted to override the recommendation of the justice panel to dismiss the impeachment complaint. \nThe impeachment complaint was filed by former Negros Oriental representative Jacinto Paras and lawyers Ferdinand Topacio and Manuelito Luna. \nAside from Bautista, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno is also facing an impeachment complaint before the House justice committee. \nAmid Bautista's resignation, there were speculations that Duterte's chief legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, was eyeing to assume the position. \nAbella, however, refused to comment on Panelo's alleged desire to serve as Comelec chief. \nPanelo, in a separate statement, dismissed as \"mere hearsay\" his alleged plan to replace Bautista. \n\"That's a mere hearsay. There have long been persistent rumors that I want to be the Comelec chairman. I am not interested to assume that position,\" he said. (PS Jun M.

      "text": "Print Article \nFormer UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks during his news conference in Seoul, South Korea January 31, 2017. — Reuters pic LONDON, Oct 24 — US President Donald Trump is “standing on the wrong side of history” in withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, former UN chief Ban Ki-moon told AFP in London yesterday. \n“I am deeply concerned about what President Trump of (the) United States has declared that the US is withdrawing from this Paris agreement. \n“I have been speaking out that his vision is politically short-sighted, and economically irresponsible and scientifically wrong. So he is standing on the wrong side of history,” Ban said on the sidelines of a London peace walk. \nThe former Secretary-General of the United Nations joined other members of The Elders, a group created by Nelson Mandela, on the procession through the city before a discussion on world peace. \nBan said despite Trump’s decision to pull out of the historic Paris agreement, he remained heartened by a US civil society campaign to continue to honour the environmental deal. \n“I am encouraged and hopeful that whole worlds will be united in moving ahead with this Paris climate change agreement. This is the political and moral responsibility of our political leaders,” he said. \nTrump announced in June the start of a three-year process to pull out of the 2015 agreement, signed by 195 countries, on the grounds that it would put the US at an economic disadvantage. \nReflecting on the broader political climate, Ban said he had been “working very closely” with Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, who last week criticised the “politics of division” which characterised the 2016 US presidential race. \nBan also decried the current “lack of commitment” to an international spirit. \n“A lack of leaders’ global vision that we are living in a very tightly-interconnected small world, and that whatever is happening in this country may affect the neighbouring countries and even all around the world,” he said. \nHe cited the “very tense period” on the divided Korean peninsula — with Pyongyang staging its sixth nuclear test and launching two intercontinental ballistic missiles — as one area where world leaders needed to act collectively. \n“As one of the Korean citizens, I’m very much committed that the whole international community should stand resolute and unified and strong voices, so that North Korea realises that there is no other way but to return to dialogue to address these issues,” he said. — AFPx",

      "text": "CLARK, Philippines (Reuters) - The timing of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' trip to the Philippines this week couldn't have been better, coming just as it celebrated a victory against Islamist militants in Marawi City - with a critical dose of help from the U.S. military.\nBut as Mattis prepared to meet President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, five Russian warships were parked off the Philippines and Moscow was preparing to formally hand over thousands of assault rifles, a million rounds of ammunition and 20 army trucks at a public ceremony on Wednesday.\nDuterte, known for his strident anti-American rhetoric, has made no secret of his plans to cultivate ties with America's rivals, Russia and China. Those efforts appear to be starting to bear fruit.\nJust before he meets Mattis, Duterte was scheduled to sit down with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday, who, like Mattis, was attending a gathering of Asian defence ministers north of Manila.\nOn Wednesday, Duterte was scheduled to visit a Russian anti-submarine ship, the Admiral Pantaleyev, docked in Manila. \nU.S. Ambassador Sung Kim played down any U.S. concerns about Duterte's outreach to China and Russia and noted that the United States, a former colonial power, was the country's only treaty ally, with far deeper ties in the Philippines.\n\"I'm not really threatened by this notion that China or Russia are providing some military equipment to the Philippines,\" Kim told a small group of reporters travelling with Mattis. \n\"We have been providing very important equipment to the Philippines for many, many years. The fact that the Chinese and the Russians have provided some rifles, I'm not sure is really such a cause for concern for the United States.\"\nDuterte's often profanity-laden tirades against the United States have become his trademark during his year-old presidency, and he has chided Washington for treating his country \"like a dog,\" despite the longstanding U.S. assistance.\nStill, Duterte's rhetoric has been inconsistent, and he warmly greeted visiting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in August, calling himself a \"humble friend\" of the United States at the time. \nAhead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the Philippines, the U.S. envoy cited an improvement in \"tone and substance\" in bilateral ties over the 10 months since he's been in his post.\n\"President Duterte has made clear that even as he pursues improved relations with countries like China and Russia, he will continue to focus on making sure that the U.S.-Philippines alliance remains strong,\" Kim said.\nMARAWI OPERATION\nThe same day that Mattis landed in the Philippines, Manila announced the end of five months of military operations in a southern city of Marawi held by pro-Islamic State rebels, after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country's biggest security crisis in years.\nThe rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have gained influence among local Muslims and have ambitions to use the island of Mindanao as a base for operations in Southeast Asia.\nMattis, on his flight to the Philippines, commended Manila on the operation and on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen U.S.-Philippines military ties in talks with the Philippine defence minister.\n\"It was a tough fight,\" Mattis said during his flight, adding he thought the Philippines had sent \"a very necessary message to the terrorists.\"\nKim said the U.S. military assistance made a \"huge difference\" in the battle in Marawi, particularly its intelligence support, including with the deployment of Gray Eagle and P-3 Orion aircraft.\n\"I think all of us were surprised by the extent of infiltration by the terrorists into Marawi City,\" he said.\n\"When you encounter a situation like that, you obviously need good intelligence to be able to target key areas and I think that's where our support was quite critical.\"\nBut even in Marawi, Duterte has also credited U.S. rival China for its assistance.\nDuterte said it was one of the 100 sniper rifles donated by China that fired the bullet that killed Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State's \"emir\" in Southeast Asia, on Oct. 16.\nThe ranger unit conducting the operation said the shot was fired from a heavier weapon mounted on an armored vehicle. \nPhilippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters on Tuesday about the receipt of heavy equipment from China to help rebuild Marawi, and also noted the receipt of rifles and ammunition from Beijing. He expected to receive four fast boats from China before the end of the year.\nThe United States has for decades been the Philippines' defence treaty ally and its biggest source of hardware and training, providing about $1 billion in equipment since 2000.\n(Additional reporting Karen Lema; Editing by Nick Macfie)",

By PTI \nStepping up his attack against the government over GST, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi today took the Gabbar Singh analogy further by referencing the Bollywood villain's dialogue to say it was a tax that coveted people's earnings. \nGandhi, who had yesterday described the goods and services tax as \"Gabbar Singh Tax\" during a rally in Gujarat, today recalled a much quoted dialogue from \"Sholay\" to sharpen his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \n\"Congress GST = Genuine Simple Tax. Modi ji's GST = Gabbar Singh Tax = yeh kamaai mujhe de de (give me the income),\" Gandhi said on Twitter. \nGabbar Singh was the name of the dacoit in the Ramesh Sippy-directed 1975 Bollywood blockbuster. The character, played by late actor Amjad Khan, says at one point of time in the film, \"Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur (another character)\". \nGandhi had targeted the Centre over the issue yesterday in a rally in Gandhinagar and called for changes in the new tax regime to make it simple. \n\"Their GST is not GST. GST means Gabbar Singh Tax. This is causing a loss to the country. Small shopkeepers are finished. Lakhs of youths have been unemployed. But they are still not ready to listen,\" he had said. He had also stated that the Modi dispensation went ahead with its version of the GST despite the Congress warning the government about the tax regime's \"adverse impact\".",

      "text": "New Delhi, October 24 Stepping up his attack against the government over GST, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took the Gabbar Singh analogy further by referencing the Bollywood villain’s dialogue to say it was a tax that coveted people’s earnings. Gandhi, who had on Monday described the goods and services tax as “Gabbar Singh Tax” during a rally in Gujarat, on Tuesday recalled a much-Quote: d dialogue from ‘Sholay’ to sharpen his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Congress GST=Genuine Simple Tax. Modi ji’s GST=Gabbar Singh Tax=yeh kamaai mujhe de de (give me the income),” Gandhi said on Twitter. Gabbar Singh was the name of the dacoit in the Ramesh Sippy-directed 1975 Bollywood blockbuster. The character, played by late actor Amjad Khan, says at one point of time in the film, “Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur.” (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd )\nGandhi had targeted the Centre over the issue on Monday in a rally at Gandhinagar and called for changes in the new tax regime to make it simple. :Their GST is not GST. GST means Gabbar Singh Tax. This is causing a loss to the country. Small shopkeepers are finished. Lakhs of youths have been unemployed. But they are still not ready to listen,” he had said. He had also stated that the Modi dispensation went ahead with its version of the GST despite the Congress warning the government about the tax regime’s “adverse impact”. PTI",

      "text": "0 Comment \nPresident Donald Trump’s eldest daughter has channeled her roles as a working mother, entrepreneur and senior adviser to the president to help sell the administration’s tax plan, which she said is overdue to address the needs of the modern American family in an increasingly competitive global market. \nIvanka Trump joined US Treasurer Jovita Carranza and former US Rep. Nan Hayworth of New York for an hour-long, town hall-style meeting at a senior center outside Philadelphia. \nShe called tax reform “critical” legislation and touted proposed changes to the tax code as changes that will help everyday Americans. \n“There are many elements of this tax plan that I think are squarely targeted at creating jobs and growth in this country and offering relief to our middle-income families,” she told the audience. \n“This is about the recognition that, as a country, we have to have policies that mirror our values. We have to encourage the next generation to be competitive and compassionate. For me, I think this couples together our core values as a country.” \nThe president has prioritized tax reform as his top agenda item and is urging Congress to pass legislation. He and other Republican leaders have crafted a proposal calling for steep tax cuts for corporations and potentially individuals, a doubling of the standard deduction used by most Americans, a reduction in the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four and a repeal of the inheritance tax on multimillion- dollar estates. \nThe tax system would be simplified, and most Americans would be able to file their income taxes on a postcard, according to the plan. \nIvanka Trump, as part of the tax reform package, has been focused on expanding the child tax credit. She drew on her life experience to connect with the audience as a mom who has an understanding of the challenges parents face with the rising cost of child care. \n“Every parent has to manage the competing demands of raising a family and their passions,” she told the crowd. “I, too, had to manage that, but I am far more fortunate than most. I had help, and I recognized that I wouldn’t be able to do even a small fraction of what I was able to do professionally or as a parent … if I didn’t have access to the means to be able to put my children in a secure and safe and protected and nurturing environment.” \nIncreasing the child tax credit, she said, could mean the difference between sending a child to an after-school program or paying for quality day care and could even aid some young couples wrestling with whether they can afford to start a family. \nDetails on how much the $1,000 child tax credit should increase have not been settled, and Ivanka Trump has not publicly offered a number.",

Following are excerpts of the interview done with Hakeem, who is also the Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage. \nQ Actually, the Government is facing serious allegations over the Central Bank bond scam. How do you analyze the current political situation in that context? \nOur Government is committed to transparency. We are prepared to face critiques of the Government and correct ourselves if any wrongdoing is highlighted. Basically, the Presidential Commission has undertaken to conduct a fact finding inquiry. There is no possibility of finding anybody guilty as such. After the report is submitted, the Government will have to examine the needs for any correctional measure. Depending on their recommendations, the Government should consider what steps need to be taken. That is to impose any punitive punishment if anyone is found guilty after a proper trial before a court of law. We have to ensure that institutional arrangements are better supervised. \nQ The Government, at the beginning, promised a lot including the introduction of a new Constitution and establishing good governance. As the SLMC Leader, how do you view the progress in terms of deliverance on these promises? \nFrom a reforms perspective, there have been discussions at the Steering Committee of Parliament as a precursor to a Constitutional Assembly. We have finalized draft proposals. The draft proposals contain alternative positions taken regarding various contentious issues. The opposition is making allegations that we are going to drastically alter the structure of the state and to lower the status given to Buddhism in the Constitution. They are creating a phobia of future disintegration of the country. This is history repeating itself. Whenever reforms are to be introduced, these forces try to interpret the proposals in a way to create negative public opinion. It’s up to the parties bent on reforms to educate the public and actively campaign for total overhaul of the Constitution. \n\nThe opposition is making allegations that we are going to drastically alter the structure of the state and to lower the status given to Buddhism in the Constitution. They are creating a phobia of future disintegration of the country. This is history repeating itself \nQ As the SLMC Leader, what is your stand on the unitary structure of the Constitution and the foremost status accorded to Buddhism? \nNone of us wants the primary status given to Buddhism diluted. While the primacy of Buddhism is preserved, we wish that the specific proviso be added to say that other religions wont be discriminated against. It’s a very innocuous clause. \nQ In the current Constitution, there are safeguards for other religions. You want something extra in this regard? \nThe Fundamental Rights Chapter has a general provision. When you add a proviso to the very same Article which gives one religion the status of supremacy, others feel that they will not suffer. They will feel that they have some accommodation. Certain xenophobic forces have been attacking mosques and other places of religious worship. They are showing a lot of intolerance. The state must be able to provide basic protection against such elements. I don’t see why such a hue and cry is made. We haven’t even used the word that this must be a secular state. In India, Hinduism has the pride of place, but the Constitution itself says it is a secular state. There is a feeling of insecurity in the people belonging to other faiths here because of what was happening. That has to be kept in mind. \nQ As for the structure of the Constitution, what is your opinion on the move to abolish the Concurrent List which outlines the subjects jointly held by the centre and the provincial councils under the present Constitution? \nThe abolition of the concurrent list is, at least, to make it clear the powers vested with the centre and the periphery. It becomes much more unambiguous otherwise. In many Federal countries, the concurrent list is preserved. \nQ The perception is that the subjects outlined in this list will be vested solely with the periphery when abolishing it. What is your argument? \nIt’s to clear ambiguity. With more than 150 years of centralized rule, bureaucrats are also not willing to part with power. Provincial Governors have been used as a tool to stifle the provincial councils from exercising the devolved powers. Once you clearly define it this way, the room for such manipulations will be reduced. \n\nCertain xenophobic forces have been attacking mosques and other places of religious worship. They are showing a lot of intolerance \nQ What is your view on the postponement of the elections to three Provincial Councils? \nWe aren’t for the postponement of any election. We want the elections to be conducted on time. We have even protested against the procedure in which the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act was brought into being. The procedure, adopted, has created the feeling that it was brought for the collateral purpose of postponing elections. There is a duty on the part of the Government to ensure that there is no inordinate delay in the conducting of elections. I have fought in Parliament, the Parliamentary Business Committee as well in the debate against the Bill itself. \nThe procedure, adopted to introduce amendments to the Provincial Council Elections Act, is totally unacceptable. It’s a violation of the right of citizens to petition the Supreme Court. Substantive changes were introduced to the original draft in the guise of amendments at the committee stage. It’s a violation of the parliamentary procedure. It’s tantamount to the violation of the Constitution. I have taken serious exceptions to the manner in which this Bill was brought to Parliament. What we voted in the Second Reading was totally different to what was in the Third Reading. This is total travesty. I am fully in agreement with those who challenged this from the outside. They are very correct in raising this objection. \nQ But, you voted for it along with others in the Government and some in the opposition. Why is it? \nI supported the Bill after the introduction of amendments. The fact is that the procedure is wrong. I stand by that. \nQ Earlier you asked for a separate administrative district for Muslims in the East. In the evolution of the new Constitution, how are you going to meet the demands of Muslims? \nIn creating a new administrative district, we have proposed to consider the needs of Tamil speaking people. Tamil speaking people in the Amapara District have to go to the Ampara town to transact business. That is done in the Sinhala language at the Ampara District Secretariat. In the coastal belt of the district, the majority speaksTamil. Yet, you continue to have businesses transacted using the Sinhala language. Those matters have to be taken into consideration. \nAny centre of administration will have to be accessible within a reasonable time frame. All those things will have to be taken into account. We have proposed a separate administrative district. \nQWhat is your stand on the merger of the North and the East? \nWe have said that the number of provinces has to remain as it is. The country will consist of nine provinces. The Tamil speaking members want the merger as an option. That remains an option. We must be able to accommodate the aspirations of different people. This is only a draft proposal. It included different options. When there is no consensus on a particular issue, we decided to add different options. It doesn’t mean the Government has agreed with the merger. There are three different options given. It is up to the Constitutional Assembly to debate on these matters, revise the draft and finally arrive at a consensus. \nEven regarding the Executive Presidency, there seems to be differences. The position of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) seems to retain it in a modified form. When we started, it was not so. The original proposal to amend the Executive Presidency has suffered some setbacks. One of the main parties, that wanted the abolition, is having second thoughts about it. \n\nThe Tamil speaking members want the merger as an option. That remains an option. We must be able to accommodate the aspirations of different people \nQ What is your party’s stand? \nWe can live with the retention of the Executive Presidency. Yet, if there is overall consensus, we won’t oppose it either. The main issue here is a fair election system. Whatever proposal made so far regarding electoral reforms haven’t generated sufficient consensus among the political parties. The minor parties have always been at loggerheads regarding the new system introduced. We want those things addressed. The parliamentary election system can’t be unilaterally changed. We have presented a separate set of proposals. \nIt has been proposed to create 140 electorates. It’s a question how to accommodate members. We fear the Muslim representation will be reduced by 50 percent or more. It’s totally unacceptable. We have submitted separate alternate proposals. \nQ How serious are you about the current constitution making process? \nThis is my 24th year in Parliament. I have served three Select Committees of Parliament. I have attended three All Party Conferences starting from the time of then President the late R. Premadasa. There has been many a slip between the cup and the lip. We are cautiously optimistic of something happening. We won’t be able to achieve much unless the UNP- SLFP Government devises a collective strategy to educate the public. Before that, we must reach consensus on critical reform areas. There is still so much of divergence in the critical areas of reform. This has to be addressed. There is going to be a parliamentary debate on the matter for three days. Let’s see how things unfold!",

      "text": "Washington, October 24\nUS President Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure North Korea when he visits China next month, a senior White House official said on Monday, stepping up a strategy to have Beijing help rein in Pyongyang.\nIsolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date.\nFollow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd )\nTrump will call on Xi to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea.\nChina, North Korea’s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country.\nChina has said it will strictly enforce UN Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North.\nBut a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump's trip said China needs to do more to comply with two U.N. Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China's support.\n\"We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those U.N. Security Council resolutions,\" the official said.\nThough China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region.\nSouth Korea, the United States and Japan started a two-day missile tracking drill on Tuesday, South Korea's military said in a statement, in preparation for any missile or nuclear threats from North Korea.\nThe exercises will be held in waters off the coasts of South Korea and Japan, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, with four Aegis combat system-equipped ships from all three countries participating in the drill.\n\"Critical\" threat\nChina's special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his US counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China's Foreign Ministry said, where they had a \"deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue\". The ministry did not elaborate.\nTrump, who has threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nBut this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan.\nThe threat from North Korea has grown to a \"critical and imminent level\" and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his U.S. and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday.\nOnodera's remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.\nThe White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff.\nAsked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a U.S. envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said: \"There's nothing planned.\"\nNo quick solution\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for Trump his country's efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program but also advised the US leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict.\n\"There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary but so is dialogue. The U.S. will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia to resolve the issue,\" he said.\nWith Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week.\nTrump's November 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nTrump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the US trade deficit with China, the White House official said.\n\"We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,\" the official said.\nDespite Trump's fierce criticism of China's trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea.\nChina has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbor.\nEven as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to US demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang. —Reuters",

We held fruitful meeting with Minister of State, Kiren Rijiju, Home Minister, Rajnath Singh and Shillong MP, Vincent Pala. A copy of the memorandum was also submitted to the office of the president of India and the office of the PM,” he added.The GHSMC later held a meeting on September 9 under the chairmanship of Nikman at Tura.“We demand a separate state under the Constitution of India framed by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, in order to safeguard tribal societies of India like Garos under the Article 3, creation of new state for the distinct language and culture under State Re-Organisation Act, 1956,” stated the release.Incidentally the rally on November 15 at Tura Chandmary playground would be the 21st such rally undertaken by the GHSMC in support for their demand.“We would like to request all, without bias to come forward and support the movement for a separate state. We would also like to request the entire Garo Community of entire North-East Region, the state, the country and the world to give support to make this a global event,” added the GHSMC.The rally is set to start at 11 am on the said date.",

      "text": "Opposition plans joint protests on note ban anniversary \nA row erupted Monday evening after senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said Gujarat police and local Intelligence Bureau sleuths took away CCTV footage from a hotel in Ahmedabad where he stayed and had meetings with Patidar agitation leader Hardik Patel and OBC leader Alpesh Thakor who, earlier in the day, joined the Congress. \nGehlot, AICC general secretary in charge of Gujarat and former Rajasthan Chief Minister, told The Indian Express that hotel authorities told him that “IB and police people inquired who all came… to meet whom. Then they took away CCTV footage and gave it to the media… Rahul Gandhi se mile, kis se mile, kya hua… inko kya matlab hai. Kaun kis se mila inko kya matlab hai. Koi absconder hai kya? (Whether someone met Rahul Gandhi or others, what happened, how is that any of their concern. Is anyone an absconder?)”. \nThe Ummed Hotel did not deny sharing the CCTV footage. When contacted, Vikram Singh Shekhawat, chief security officer of the hotel, said “no room was searched by police but there were many police and IB officials deployed in the hotel throughout the day due to VVIP visits. The police did ask for CCTV footage and, after consulting our top management, we provided it to them. This was all for security reasons.” \nGehlot spoke out after some TV channels aired visuals which purportedly showed Hardik Patel entering a hotel elevator. There was speculation that he had a secret meeting with Rahul Gandhi. \nGehlot said Patel and Thakor had come to meet him separately at night. He said he was told by hotel authorities that police and IB personnel told them they would inspect the rooms. “They wanted to know who stayed in which room. Whether Hardik stayed… in which room Ashok Gehlot stayed. It is the first time I have seen people stooping to this level,” he said. \nAsked how did he get to know about what police and IB did, he said: “Hotelwale bataye humko (hotel staff told me). They told us that IB people have taken away footage. And it was shown on TV. People are seen coming and going, Hardik Patel coming into the hotel. For Jay Shah, they will argue about privacy in court… and here they are giving footage to the media.” \n“I am asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is behind all this… How did the footage come in the media… because the local IB or police, they will not do anything without a signal from the BJP government, its leaders, Chief Minister, Prime Minister or PMO… And why did they seek the footage? Are Alpesh, Hardik and Jignesh Mewani absconders,” Gehlot said. \nIn a series of tweets, Gehlot said: “I met Hardik n Jignesh in Ummed Hotel. IB, Police are chckng hotel rooms. @PMOIndia @narendramodi ji Wat is happening in Gandhiji’s Gujarat? The rooms which hv been booked in my name are being checked. We are openly saying, we have met them n will keep meeting them in future too.” \n“When they met BJP leaders, then their offices were not checked. Why it is being done now? Are #HardikPatel and #JigneshMevani criminals or absconders? If that is so, BJP must clear its stand. Why CCTV footage was taken by IB n police from Hotel? Is the right to privacy, sole proprietorship of #JayAmitShah? I condemn all this surveillance being done on BJP’s orders,” he tweeted. \nGujarat Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja and Ahmedabad Police Commissioner A S K Singh did not respond to allegations levelled by Gehlot.

CPI(M) leader M.V. Govindan and CPI leader Sathyan Mokeri were among those who spoke. \nAt Sreekantapram, P.K. Sreemathy, MP, CPI(M) district secretary P. Jayarajan, and CPI district secretary P.

An acknowledgement for receipt of the complaint has been issued. No first information report (FIR) had been lodged,\" a police official in Anna Nagar police station in Madurai told IANS over phone on Monday. \nTemple town Madurai is around 500 km from Chennai. \nMersal is in the midst of a controversy after the Tamil Nadu unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded the removal of certain dialogues which take a dig at the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Digital India. \nDirected by Atlee, Mersal stars Vijay in the roles of a village head, a doctor and a magician. It is doing brisk business at the box office. \nBJP's National Secretary H. Raja and Tamil Nadu BJP President Tamilisai Soundararajan criticised Vijay and the movie for the dialogues critical of GST and Digital India. \nThe BJP leaders said the dialogues were factually incorrect. \nIn a tweet on Monday, Soundararajan said like the freedom to express views, one has the freedom to rebut wrong views. \nRaja, who raked up the actor's Christian origin by his tweet \"Joseph Vijay's hatred for Modi is Mersal \" on October 21, continued that on Monday. \nHe uploaded the actor's voter identity card and a letter written by the actor to a magazine on his letter pad. \n\"Truth is bitter,\" tweeted Raja on Monday uploading the two documents to underscore Vijay's religion. \nVijay, who had met Narendra Modi during electioneering ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, had even lauded demonetisation last year.",

      "text": "BJP’s victory song: AAP jaisa koi meri B-team main aa jaaye By Deepal Trivedi, Ahmedabad Mirror | Updated: Oct 24, 2017, 02.00 AM IST Faced with the imminent threat of three powerful youth movement leaders — including Hardik Patel and Alpesh Thakor — backing the Congress, the BJP is interestingly banking upon its one-time bitter rival, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), to sharpen its prospects on at least over a dozen seats in the upcoming Gujarat polls. Assembly elections in Gujarat are likely in December and the BJP is seeking a fifth consecutive victory. However, this is the first BJP election since 15 years that the BJP is fighting without Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister. Top sources confirmed to Ahmedabad Mirror that the BJP “is contented with the list of 11 candidates declared by the AAP in Gujarat”. We have evaluated these candidates. None of them is capable to win but they will for sure dent into Congress vote bank and thereby benefit us,” a BJP leader said. At least 10 of the 11 seats that the AAP has declared its candidates for are seats where the saffron party is on a shaky wicket because of the ongoing Patel and OBC agitations in Gujarat. These are seats where the agitation has made a visible impact. These 11 seats also include five Assembly seats of Bapunagar, Lathi, Chhota Udepur, Padra and Karjan which the BJP won with a margin of less than 5,000 votes in the last elections. “With the ongoing agitations, majority of these 11 seats are a challenge for us. In this case, we know that the AAP will dent into the Congress vote bank and thereby indirectly help us,” a BJP leader said. The AAP leaders have denied these claims vehemently. Talking to Mirror, the AAP spokesperson and State media coordinator Harshil Nayak rubbished the claims as baseless. “After our defeat in Punjab assembly election, the AAP was working on a strategy. As part of this strategy, we have decided to contest polls on seats where we find good candidates and have a strong grassroots set up.” Nayak further added that the party has declared only 11 candidates so far. Read Also AAP comes out with first list of 11 candidates for Gujarat polls “Fifty more candidates are under review. If the Congress is so sure that we are helping the BJP, I would want to ask them: Can the Congress assure that it will defeat the BJP if the AAP does not field any candidates in the remaining seats?” he said. He also added that if it is the BJP that the Congress wants to fight, it should not contest on any Delhi seats in the 2020 state assembly election. Harshil articulated the rigorous process his party has adopted to select candidates. Quoting Gujarat in charge Gopal Rai (whom Mirror tried to contact but he remained unavailable), Harshil said, “We are anti-BJP. We have a democratic right to contest. The Congress has been claiming that we do not have any infrastructure to give a good fight. In this case, if the Congress assures us that it would defeat BJP we will not announce any more candidates. Also, Congress cannot decide or order us not to contest in Gujarat polls.” However, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia categorically told Mirror that the AAP was working as the BJP’s B team. “The AAP has declared candidates for 11 seats. I am confident that it will not win any of these seats most of its candidates will lose their deposits. However, they will hurt us very badly in all these seats. He added, “If the AAP is really serious about fighting the BJP, why is it fighting the Congress? A third force has always damaged the Congress in Gujarat and the AAP knows this. Why is it helping the BJP?” Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani is contesting on Rajkot (West) seat. Against him is young the Congress MLA Indranil Rajyaguru. However, the AAP’s Rajesh Bhut is likely to dent Congress votes. Similar is the case in Bapunagar, Unjha, Gondal, Lathi, Padra, Karjan and Kamrej where Hardik Patel’s ongoing agitation for reservation has had a very positive impact and has threatened BJP’s victory. Out of the 11 seats on which the AAP has declared candidature, only Danilimda and Chhota Udepur are currently with the Congress. The rest are with the BJP. Danilimda has sizeable Muslim population and Chhota Udepur has a tribal majority. On both these seats, the AAP candidates will hurt the Congress. Another senior Congress leader told Mirror, the BJP can win majority of these seats with the help of the AAP, NCP and Jankvikalp parties. “The Janvikalp is a front floated by former Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela. If each of these parties even bag a thousand votes each, the BJP can manage to win. The BJP won four of these 11 seats with a vote margin of less than four thousand in 2012, despite a strong pro-BJP wave and with Narendra Modi as the CM. When contacted State Gujarat BJP chief Jitu Vaghani denied the claims, saying I do not want to comment on this issue.",

By PTI \nStepping up his attack against the government over GST, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi today took the Gabbar Singh analogy further by referencing the Bollywood villain's dialogue to say it was a tax that coveted people's earnings. \nGandhi, who had yesterday described the goods and services tax as \"Gabbar Singh Tax\" during a rally in Gujarat, today recalled a much quoted dialogue from \"Sholay\" to sharpen his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \n\"Congress GST = Genuine Simple Tax. Modi ji's GST = Gabbar Singh Tax = yeh kamaai mujhe de de (give me the income),\" Gandhi said on Twitter. \nGabbar Singh was the name of the dacoit in the Ramesh Sippy-directed 1975 Bollywood blockbuster. The character, played by late actor Amjad Khan, says at one point of time in the film, \"Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur (another character)\". \nGandhi had targeted the Centre over the issue yesterday in a rally in Gandhinagar and called for changes in the new tax regime to make it simple. \n\"Their GST is not GST. GST means Gabbar Singh Tax. This is causing a loss to the country. Small shopkeepers are finished. Lakhs of youths have been unemployed. But they are still not ready to listen,\" he had said. He had also stated that the Modi dispensation went ahead with its version of the GST despite the Congress warning the government about the tax regime's \"adverse impact\".",

My father was a high school teacher. We were 8 children. My siblings and I have watched our mother cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner using woodstove and the poor lady had to work very hard. By PTI \nRecalling his mother's ordeal of cooking on woodstove, Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy today said the government should provide subsidies to businesses which sell clean energy products like cookstoves in rural India. \nHe also said India should focus more on providing better healthcare facilities, education, nutrition and clean energy to its vast population. \"If country like India has to indeed redeem the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, then India has to work on health, education, nutrition and clean energy,\" Murthy said at an event organised by Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. \nThe iconic co-founder of infosys also said that he has seen the impact of not having clean cookstoves. \"I come from a family of lower middle class. My father was a high school teacher. We were 8 children. My siblings and I have watched our mother cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner using woodstove and the poor lady had to work very hard. \n\"It was very very tiring for her. We have seen her suffer,\" Murthy recalled. Pitching for government subsidies for companies that make clean energy products like cookstoves, he pointed out that businesses in India are not focusing on clean energy. \nSpeaking at the same occasion, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said the government has provided 30 million LPG connections so far and aims to provide 80 million LPG connections by 2020. \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been great believer of technology and he has directed ONGC to work towards making electric 'chullah',\" Kant said. \"40 per cent of world's population is still dependent on traditional biomasss for cooking and are exposed to indoor air pollution. It's like smoking 400 cigarettes a day,\" he added.",

      "text": "New Delhi, October 24 Stepping up his attack against the government over GST, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took the Gabbar Singh analogy further by referencing the Bollywood villain’s dialogue to say it was a tax that coveted people’s earnings. Gandhi, who had on Monday described the goods and services tax as “Gabbar Singh Tax” during a rally in Gujarat, on Tuesday recalled a much-Quote: d dialogue from ‘Sholay’ to sharpen his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Congress GST=Genuine Simple Tax. Modi ji’s GST=Gabbar Singh Tax=yeh kamaai mujhe de de (give me the income),” Gandhi said on Twitter. Gabbar Singh was the name of the dacoit in the Ramesh Sippy-directed 1975 Bollywood blockbuster. The character, played by late actor Amjad Khan, says at one point of time in the film, “Ye haath mujhe de de Thakur.” (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd )\nGandhi had targeted the Centre over the issue on Monday in a rally at Gandhinagar and called for changes in the new tax regime to make it simple. :Their GST is not GST. GST means Gabbar Singh Tax. This is causing a loss to the country. Small shopkeepers are finished. Lakhs of youths have been unemployed. But they are still not ready to listen,” he had said. He had also stated that the Modi dispensation went ahead with its version of the GST despite the Congress warning the government about the tax regime’s “adverse impact”. PTI",

Updated: October 24, 2017, 3:19 PM IST Tamil film actor Vishal. Chennai: Tamil actor Vishal, who was raided by Income Tax officials after his slanging match with the state BJP over the film Mersal, is in no mood to back down saying he is ready to face the consequences for criticising the government. \"If I have to face the consequence for speaking up against someone in the government, bring it on,” the actor-producer told CNN-News18’s Zakka Jacob in an interview on Tuesday, a day after I-T sleuths ‘visited’ the office of his Vishal Film Factory. The actor also sharpened his attack on Tamil Nadu BJP leader H Raja for objecting to some portions of the Vijay-starrer Mersal after he reportedly claimed to have watched a pirated version online. “What are we waiting for?,” he asked about the delay in taking action against Raja, adding governments which were strict in taking action against other crimes went slow when it came to piracy. “As a leader what example are you trying to set. It’s a crime, irrespective of whatever position you hold,” he said adding, “If you curb piracy we pay more taxes and the government can spend more for the people.” Vishal who got into a war of words with Raja after the BJP leader hit out at Vijay for purported anti-GST comments in Mersal, said he will continue to campaign for reducing tax on film tickets from 28%. I-T sleuths knocked at the doors of his film company a day after his spat with Raja, but Vishal preferred to call it a “visit” and said he was not sure whether it was out of political vendetta.",

The injured victims were being treated at a state-run hospital. \nEvery day, thousands of Indians take short cuts across railway tracks, but this can prove deadly. \nNearly 28,000 people were killed in accidents along tracks in 2014, mostly run down by speeding trains, the latest data from India's crime records bureau shows. \nIndia's railways transport nearly 23 million passengers every day. But critics say the creaking British-era network is inefficient, overburdened and unsafe. More about",

      "text": "India's utility scale solar capacity addition to slow down to 6GW \nPower surplus will hurt its current peak of 8GW. \nThe Indian solar market is being tested to its limits. GST has increased execution costs. According to Bridge to India, module prices have shot up when bidders were factoring in another 20% price decline by the end of this year. Chinese module suppliers are even reluctant to supply to India. \nThe government is considering anti-dumping duty petition to support domestic solar manufacturers. But perhaps, the biggest challenge facing the sector is slowing power demand. Lack of visibility over project pipeline is forcing developers to bid aggressive tariffs and reconsider strategic options including consolidation. \nIt is therefore relevant to ask what does the future pipeline scenario look like? \nHere's what Bridge to India has to say: \nSeven states – Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab – together make up over 80% of India’s total installed and pipeline capacity of 27 GW. \nOther states continue to lag and progress is expected to be slow because of surplus power situation in the country. \nAfter peaking at about 8 GW in 2017, India’s utility scale solar capacity addition is expected to stabilize at a much lower level of 5-6 GW per annum for next few years; The ten largest states in India have power consumption greater than 50 billion units each and together, they account for 75% of India’s total power demand. \nThese states, located mainly in central and southern India, should also account for bulk of solar power demand in the country. Five of these states – Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Rajasthan – have led the sector growth so far and tied up more than 3 GW of solar capacity each. \nMadhya Pradesh and Punjab have tied up another 2 GW and 1 GW respectively. These seven states together make up for over 80% of India’s total installed and pipeline capacity of 27 GW. \nThey have front-loaded their solar power demand and are well ahead of their annual targets determined by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Solar activity in these states is inevitably expected to slow down going forward and indeed, some of them are already cancelling ongoing tenders. \nIn contrast, combined installed and tendered pipeline capacity of the three largest power consuming states, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, is lower than that of Karnataka on a stand-alone basis. \nIn May 2017, we predicted that Uttar Pradesh could be a dark horse for India’s new solar allocations. Since then, it has issued a 750 MW tender under SECI scheme and is believed to be considering further tenders. Maharashtra’s power consumption is almost three times that of Andhra Pradesh but its installed solar capacity is just one-third in comparison. Gujarat, a solar frontrunner back in 2012-13, is also lagging way behind. It added a paltry 211 MW in the last two years against almost 1 GW in neighbouring Rajasthan and 2 GW in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. \nUnfortunately, the prevailing power surplus situation in India suggests that slowdown in solar power demand may continue for 3-4 years. We expect India’s utility scale solar capacity addition to peak in the current year (at about 8 GW) and then stabilize at a much lower 5-6 GW per annum for the next 2-3 years. Rooftop solar is expected to, however, provide some relief by continuing to grow at a healthy rate and becoming a 3 GW per annum market by 2020.",

I had had the opportunity of meeting a lot of people in various professional settings and saw how their true selves reflected through even in a sanitised professional world. So when I found myself at the receiving end of a subtle but dogged sexual harassment, I didn't write it off as a figment of my imagination, I knew exactly what it was.\nI was required to make a two-week long trip to the headquarter offices in the United States, as was custom for most senior positions in my company. After a few discussions on the dates, I asked the sole woman working in the administration departments to make bookings for the two-week slot.\nJust an hour later, I saw another senior management colleague (let's call him Mark) walk a few seats past me to go to the admin and ask her what dates I was booked for. He asked for his trip to also be scheduled for the same dates. It wasn't unusual for people of different departments to have synced their HQ trips, to attend common meetings together, so even though this did strike me as a little odd, I didn't make much of it. Mark was about a decade older than me, married and had kids. We were in different departments, and our professional interactions were limited to a few meetings and related discussions per week. Mark and I were the only two India office visitors to the HQ that fortnight.\nHe coolly said, \"ah, I thought you'd want to come up?!\" I was shocked and could just manage blurting out a meek 'no'. The US office was in a historical suburban town. It was a serene and a beautiful suburb, with a national park, several biking trails and nature walks around, but also utterly lifeless. The next big city was 30 miles away. The first two days of the trip were uneventful and simply boring. The office would be drained of people by 5:30 pm sharp, and the shops in the downtown area shut at 6:00 pm. I had previously only travelled to the big cities in the USA, so I had no idea how dull and isolated the suburbs would be. Unlike the red carpet welcome that would be given to HQ visitors in India, with a fleet of cars at their disposal, a chockablock evening calendar with people taking turns to take them out for dinner, drinks, shopping, touristy trips, there was no such arrangement at the US offices. All 'catch-ups' would happen during office hours.\nUnwilling to go solo, I asked Mark if he wanted to make a quick evening trip to the big city nearby (30 miles away) and we could head back immediately post dinner. I wanted to walk around downtown, the city centre, and soak in as much history as the long summer hours would allow. I insisted on quick dinner because the thought of entering an already dead town at a dead hour gave me the heebie-jeebies. We cabbed it back to the hotel at a decent hour, maybe around 9 pm, and while heading up, he got the lift button but didn't press for my floor. I immediately reached and pushed the number, which was a few floors before his. He coolly said, \"ah, I thought you'd want to come up?!\" I was shocked and could just manage blurting out a meek 'no'.\nHe had had enough time to browse through my recent chats and was looking up my emails, flight and cab booking details of the weekend. The next morning we ran into each other at the tiny buffet area for breakfast. We piled up our plates and awkwardly decided to eat at the same table. He asked about my weekend plans--I'd made bookings to fly down to visit a friend on the East Coast-- and unasked went on to tell me his plans, \"I am going to go to this beach city nearby, it's supposed to be quite an experience, I hear\". I refused to ask him what exactly was he trying to convey by that 'experience' bit. After breakfast, I walked to the reception and asked them when I could deposit my luggage for the weekend; they were upgrading my room for the week after. Out of nowhere, Mark suggested, \"You know, you could just hand it to me, I could safely keep your luggage for you.\" I didn't even know he'd been overhearing my conversation with the receptionist, leave alone the fact that he thought it perfectly suitable to offer such a ridiculous and overreaching solution. \"No Mark, why would I do that? No thanks, no\", I said, and I was visibly pissed.\nI waited for him to be out of earshot and went back to the reception and blurted out, \"He is not my husband (I don't even know why I said that!). He and I are not together, we are from the same office, but that's that. So when I deposit my luggage with the front desk, I will do so with the trust that you will not allow anyone else access to it. Please make a note of this, and let your team know.\" They probably weren't going to do that anyway, but I just wanted to be sure. I was creeped out. The weekend came and went, and Monday morning we were at the buffet area again. I took a table in a quieter corner, and Mark thought it perfectly okay to join me. I was texting my friend about my safe return to the hotel, got up to get a coffee and returned a minute later. I looked down to pick up my phone and finish my text. Despite the identical phone models issued to all of us, it didn't look like my phone! I pressed a random button, and the screensaver wasn't mine. It wasn't my phone. I looked up at Mark, and he was casually browsing through my phone. He'd probably been doing that for the last minute or so. \"What are you doing with my phone?\", I asked him. \"Oops, no wonder I'm so confused, all these names seemed totally unfamiliar. I kept wondering who are these people!\", he chortled, trying to sound genuinely mistaken and amused.\nMark was a serious, no-nonsense person with a dry and obscure sense of humour, and he liked being in control of things, always. Definitely not the goofy, absentminded, 'cool' guy he was trying to pass off as, at that moment. \"No, you knew it was my phone. You went for it. And it takes a good minute to realise you've picked up someone else's phone? Really?\", I asked him, barely managing to keep my voice bereft of anger. I felt utterly violated and disgusted, took my phone back to see what he was looking into. He wasn't in the BBM window, he had had enough time to browse through my recent chats, and was looking up my emails, flight and cab booking details of the weekend. To check if I really spent my weekend with a female friend, or was I gallivanting about? This is a professional colleague I'm talking about, not a jealous partner.\nI spent the next five days avoiding him during the evening hours\nI took those nature walks and went on a bike trail. I tried sushi at a Japanese restaurant that looked charming, I walked by the downtown on an unusually busy day and saw people swarm the cafes and restaurants. I got a tub of frozen yoghurt, sat on a bench by the sidewalk and I also remember playing lots of Candy Crush on my iPad till I felt like crashing for the day.\nThe week after, I was back at my home office. I told no one about Mark's intrusive and borderline obsessive behaviour during the trip. I was embarrassed to even to bring it up, and I thought people would brush it off as an inconsequential thing. Most of all I didn't want to be in the news for the 'wrong' reasons and be associated in people's minds as a victim of harassment. Something told me I'd be the poster person of juicy gossip, while life would pretty much remain the same for him.\nA few weeks later, as a part of my role, not spurred by the events during my trip, I co-conducted office-wide workshops on Prevention Of Sexual Harassment along with an expert in the field. Mark made several attempts to derail the severe nature of the topic at hand with offhand remarks and questions such as, \"this entire subject is very arbitrary. Who will decide if it is harassment or not? Why can't the intentions of the men be believed? Who will defend the men?\" To his regressive mind, it was an issue of hapless men vs the world which believes all women are victims. The expert and I tried to explain and answer him matter-of-factly, but he continued to trivialise the discussion.\nAfter the first session, the expert and I did a debrief on the pace of the discussion. She asked me, \"Who was that gentleman who kept asking nonsensical questions on purpose time and again? He seemed like he's in a senior role. His behaviour is unacceptable, and it sends a message that the organisation tolerates his views on the matter rather than deal with is sensibly and sensitively, should any situation come up...\" It seemed like it was just the validation I was waiting for, and at that moment, I told her who he was, what was his role and position with the company, and about the way he'd behaved with me during the work trip. She didn't waste a second in saying that his behaviour was very inappropriate, unwelcome and totally out of line and that he was abusing his position in the company to exert his demands on the women around. \"This is harassment, and I hope you've talked about this with an appropriate person\", she added.\nThough Mark was in a different department and assignment of my projects, compensation or promotion didn't depend on him at all, my work needed the collaboration and approval of several stakeholders, him being the senior most one of them. So, Mark's retaliation towards me came in the form of stalling those discussions and refusing to collaborate. He shot my ideas and projects down in the garb of them not being thought through. Despite him being the only one who vehemently and persistently opposed anything and everything I had to say, most others didn't notice. \"You really need to iron your differences with him to get your work done\", was the studied advice I got from my manager (who was also Mark's manager) when I called out the unnecessarily aggressive behaviour for what it was. I told him about how he behaved at the sexual harassment awareness workshops, and what the expert had to say about him. I didn't make any mention of the incidents with me. \"It took me five months to hire someone for this role. The team is really coming together only now. He is a very difficult man and he has his quirks, granted, but we have to find a way to work with him\", he said when I insisted that such behaviour should not be condoned because the person is so senior, but merits correction for those very reasons.\nI was at the end of my rope, but frankly, I never really fought it out\nI backed out of the situation and consoled myself by thinking: 'be thankful he and you don't need to work together'. I tried to maintain bare minimum professional contact with him. Because the one time I gave it a half-attempt by talking to the manager, his indifferent response only reiterated that this whole exercise was futile and a waste of everyone's time. Each time the victim, be it a woman or a man, brushes off harassment as \"shit happens\", we normalise the predator's behaviour. We let them carry on, without any disincentive for their actions. We instil doubts in a victim's mind about violation of themselves as something not worthy enough of being called out. We gaslight them as the crazy ones, the ones who love to make a mountain of molehills and don't know how to just get on with it. It's time we don't let the harassers get away. We need to pause, listen and face these uncomfortable truths because not only do they erode shareholder value by fostering a toxic work environment but because quite simply, it's the right thing to do.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this post are the personal views of the author.

Moreover, Supreme Court must give her a lump sum compensation because all of her family people died after the Godhra incident and she was being raped.\" \nThe Supreme Court sought a detailed reply from the Gujarat Government within four weeks in connection with the case. \n\"The Supreme Court has asked Gujarat government what departmental action was taken against the policemen, who were on duty but did not stop the crime from happening and did not come forward to protect Bilkis Bano. \nThey may not have been tried under Indian Penal code but department action was nonetheless required to be taken for dereliction of duty,\" said another activist Abha Singh. \nThe apex court also directed the state government to apprise it about the departmental action taken against the policemen found guilty of negligence of duty. \nIn March 2002, Bilkis Bano was gang raped and left for dead alongside 14 members of her family, including her 3-year-old daughter, during the Gujarat riots. \nShe was then five months pregnant, when rioters attacked her in Vadodara.

File image of Hardik Patel. PTI \n\"The Congress leaders had invited me to meet them but I was at a rally in Mahisagar district. I reached very late, may be 3 am, and met Ashok Gehlot. I presented the demands of the Patidars and the issues we are concerned about,\" Patel said. \n\"It had got very late, so I put up at the hotel and left in the morning,\" the Patel leader said. He stressed, \"It is absolutely wrong that I met Rahul Gandhi. I will meet when he comes next. And if I want to meet him, I don't have to do so secretly. I am not meeting a terrorist, or meeting Nawaz Sharif at midnight like Narendra Modi did.\" \nEarlier, at a public meeting in Mandal in North Gujarat, Patel said, \"If BJP is a mahachor, the Congress is a chor. And if a chor's help is needed to trounce a mahachor, we will do that also.\" \nMeanwhile, Ashok Gehlot demanded to know through a tweet how could the police or the government ask for CCTV grabs of a hotel. \"I met Hardik and Jignesh in Ummed Hotel. IB, Police are checking hotel rooms. What is happening in Gandhiji's Gujarat? I condemn all this surveillance being done on BJP's orders.\" \n\"Are HardikPatel and Jignesh Mevani criminals or absconders? If that is so, BJP must clear its stand. When they met BJP leaders, then their offices were not checked. Why it is being done now?,\" he asked. \n\"The rooms which have been booked in my name are being checked. We are openly saying, we have met them and will keep meeting them in future too,\" he said. \nInterestingly, the CCTV grabs were almost simultaneously telecast by all Gujarati TV channels, each one claiming it to be an exclusive. \nPublished Date: Oct 24, 2017 08:24 am | Updated Date: Oct 24, 2017 08:24 am Tags : #Ashok gehlot #Bjp #Congress #Gujarat #Hardik patel #Newstracker #Patidar #Patidar agitation #Rahul gandhi Also See",

Quota spearhead Hardik Patel can play the role of kingmaker in the state as he commands considerable influence over Patidar community of the state. By: Anurag Kumar || Updated: 24 Oct 2017 09:57 AM Image: Hardik Patel/ Twitter - - - - - - - - - Advertisement - - - - - - - - - New Delhi: Gujarat Assembly elections are just around the corner and political activity has gained momentum in the state with Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting the home state thrice in October and more than five times this year. Not far behind the PM, the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi (who is all set to become president of the party) has also visited the state quite frequently recently. The Election Commission is yet to announced the dates for the Assembly elections in Gujarat and parties are trying to using the time in their favour. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been in power for the last two decades in Gujarat with Modi himself being the CM of the state before becoming the PM. Screen grab: Google maps A third player in Gujarat Interestingly, in Gujarat, in addition to BJP and Congress, there is a third player-- Hardik Patel --(who is giving an additional boost to the political motion). Quota spearhead Hardik Patel can play the role of kingmaker in the state as he commands considerable influence over Patidar community of the state. There are also reports doing rounds that Hardik Patel met Rahul Gandhi in a hotel in Ahmedabad on Monday. However, denial came immediately. In an exclusive interview to ABP Live's Anurag Kumar, Hardik Patel in May 2017, had hinted that he may support Congress party. EXCLUSIVE: Modi only 'burst balloons in air'; BJP won't win more than 60 seats in Gujarat, says Hardik Patel Recently, again he hinted the same to the channel. \"Congress is better than BJP,\" Hardik Patel said in an exclusive conversation with ABP News channel, on Sunday. Patidars, reportedly, represents 12.3% of the population of Gujarat and Hardik Patel with his oratorical skills commands significant influence over them. Anti-incumbency plus support for Congress plus Patidar factor may turn the table in favour of the Congress party. If Congress, by chance, with the support of Patidars comes to power, it will going to be a big blow for the ruling BJP, given the fact that General elections are also scheduled to take place in 2019. The result of Gujarat Assembly elections will definitely affect the result of the General election of 2019. And even if Congress fails to come to power, it appears, that the grand old party is all set to give a tough fight. Continous visits of Rahul Gandhi to the state is a proof of that. Whatever will be the result, it will be interesting to watch.

      "text": "US needs to work with others on North Korea crisis: PM Lee US needs to work with others on North Korea crisis: PM Lee By - October 24, 2017 US President Donald Trump and Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong deliver joint statements to reporters in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, October 23, 2017. Reuters \nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for President Donald Trump his country’s efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program but also advised the US leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict. \n“There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary, but so is dialogue,” Lee said in remarks with Trump at the White House. “The US will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia, to resolve the issue.” \nHe urged Trump to build a good relationship with China, noting that Singapore and other countries in the region “watch your relations with China very closely” and see it as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world.” \nA senior White House official also said US President Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure North Korea when he visits China next month, stepping up a strategy to have Beijing help rein in Pyongyang. \nIsolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. \nTrump will call on Xi to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea. \nChina, North Korea’s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. \nChina has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. \nBut a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump’s trip said China needs to do more to comply with two U.N. Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China’s support. \n“We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those U.N. Security Council resolutions,” the official said. \nThough China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. \nChina’s special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his US counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said, where they had a “deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue”. The ministry did not elaborate. \nTrump, who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nBut this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan. \n‘CRITICAL’ THREAT \nThe threat from North Korea has grown to a “critical and imminent level” and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his US and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday. \nOnodera’s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. \nThe White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff. \nAsked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a US envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said: “There’s nothing planned.” \nWith Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week. \nTrump’s Nov. 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. \nTrump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the US trade deficit with China, the White House official said. \n“We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,” the official said. \nDespite Trump’s fierce criticism of China’s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea. \nChina has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbor. \nEven as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to US demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang.

[Special coverage] \nFrom the exquisite torch used at the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics to the fancy cycling helmets painted with Peking opera masks worn by Chinese track cyclists at the 2016 Rio Olympics, items on display at an exhibition in Beijing on Monday triggered oohs and ahhs from visitors flocking to the show to review China's social and economic achievements over the past five years. \nSome high-profile athletes attended the show at the Beijing Exhibition Hall, recalling their own highlight moments while learning about the progress their country achieved in other fields. \n\"I feel really thrilled to learn how much our country has developed in so many areas, not only in sports, with such a concrete presentation of items, illustrations and models,\" said Dong Dong, China's Olympic and world champion trampoline athlete. \"The sense of national pride just encourages you to work harder in whatever you do individually.\" \nDong was among a whopping 1,000 members of a sports delegation who visited the exhibition, Five Years of Sheer Endeavor, on Monday. It opened on Sept 25. \nThe country's State-run sports system deserves credit for the momentum of scientific innovation that has brought a technology-centered approach to sports development at both the elite and grassroots levels, Dong said. \n\"The progress in our talent-development system, which now combines all relevant sciences, is really remarkable,\" the 28-year-old veteran said. \nWorld champion table tennis star Fan Zhendong said the inspiration he felt at the exhibit was a morale boost that will help him win more titles and actively promote sports off the stage. \n\"Since the top leadership in our country attaches so much importance to sports development, we as front-runners in the business need to shoulder more responsibility for spreading the positive energy of sports participation to the public,\" said Fan, who won his first world title when he was 17 years old in May 2014. He was one of China's youngest athletes to do so. \nAmong the sports delegates was the new coach of the Chinese women's national handball team, Jesper Holmris of Denmark, who was enthusiastic about many of the exhibits. \"It's interesting to be here to see how fast the development has been going on in China, which is amazing,\" said Holmris, who last visited China 20 years ago. \n\"This is like a team-building experience for us, coming from Scandinavian culture to learn about what's going on in general in China. It will help us better understand the culture and do our job in sports,\" he said. Related news",

You can play multiplayer games with these titles across console types, but only in System Link mode.\n\"Now there are other players with nuclear competence\", Goldfein said, pointing out that the world is not a bipolar place where the main actors are only the USA and the Soviet Union.\nThe decision was made against the backdrop of \"the rapid development of North Korea's nuclear arsenal\", according to David Goldfein and other senior USA military officials Quote: d by the newspaper, which in turn 'do not hesitate to emphasize President Trump's hawkish approach to Pyongyang.' The rise in Russian military potential is also cited. \"It's never been more important to make sure that we get this mission right\".\nIn a report by security news website Defense One , Air Force chief of staff Gen. David Goldfein said the military was considering the move in light of rising tensions with North Korea.\nHe said: \"I've challenged Air Force Global Strike Command to help lead the dialogue, help with this discussion about 'What does conventional conflict look like with a nuclear element?' and 'Do we respond as a global force if that were to occur?' and 'What are the options?'\". He also asked his team to think of innovative ways a nuclear weapon can be used, either for deterrence or combat.\nPollution-related deaths in India rank among the highest globally, study reveals\nMost of these nine million deaths occur from pollution-related diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and lung-cancer. Other nations with deadly environments include Haiti , Bangladesh, South Sudan, Pakistan and North Korea .\nBarksdale Air Force base in northwestern Louisiana is the home of Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all nuclear forces the Air Force has under it's command. Still, at least one tangible sign of the potential move is in motion: The building where B-52 crews slept during the Cold War is being renovated, notes Defense One .\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later asserted that the diplomatic efforts to relax tensed relations with North Korea would continue \"until the first bomb drops\".\nThe situation on the Korean Peninsula has grown progressively tenser as Pyongyang has continued to launch a missile and nuclear tests, in spite of warnings of the global community and, in particular, the United States.\nEuropean Union leaders meeting in Brussels to issue statement on Iran nuclear deal\nHe is also determined to confront Iran's meddling in neighbouring states. He called on Europe to actively oppose Mr Trump's position. They had lobbied the administration hard and lost.",

The Cuban School of Wushu and Qigong celebrated its 22nd anniversary on Sunday in a popular square in Havana with a massive demonstration of Chinese martial arts. (Xinhua/Joaquin Hernandez) \nHAVANA, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban School of Wushu and Qigong celebrated its 22nd anniversary on Sunday in a popular square in Havana with a massive demonstration of Chinese martial arts. \nFrom breathing exercises to Qigong movements performed by young and old students, as well as traditional martial arts executed by children, the celebration saw varied performances. \n\"It has really been 22 years of transformations, of perseverance and steadiness, of fulfilling a mission and being able to bring Chinese culture, not only to the Chinese who live here and their descendants, but to all Cubans,\" Roberto Vargas Lee, director and founder of the school, told Xinhua. \nVargas Lee said that Wushu and Qigong are already inserted within Cuban society and the school is present in all the provinces of the country. \nLocated in Havana's Chinatown, the Cuban School of Wushu was founded in 1995 with the aim of developing Chinese martial arts and therapeutic exercises (Jian Shen Qigong) and also contributing to the rescue of Chinese traditional culture. \n\"China has put these ancient martial arts in our hands for the benefit of all Cubans and we will continue in this endeavor for many more years,\" he said. \nVargas Lee participated in the various demonstrations of Qigong and concluded the celebration with a special interpretation of the song \"Cabalgando con Fidel,\" a single dedicated to the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro. \n\"170 years ago, the first Chinese arrived in Cuba and there is a common history. I think, with the Wushu school, we have helped to build bridges of friendship between our countries,\" he said. \nThe school now has about 15,000 students all over Cuba and 2,500 in Havana. \nAlthough the highest percent are represented by children and young people, elderly people also are attracted to the practice. \nIn the Qigong demonstration celebrated at Old Havana's San Francisco square, many students took part, to show how these exercises improve their quality of life. \n\"Wushu and Qigong have contributed a lot to me because they give me spiritual and mental peace and help with all the problems of daily life,\" Edenia Curbelo, 74, who has been practicing this martial art for 15 years, told Xinhua. \nFor others like Nidia Naranjo, 68, practicing Qigong represents a way to have \"a healthy mind and body\" as well as an opportunity to meet new people. \n\"I have been practicing these exercises since four years ago and I happily go out every morning to perform them to maintain good health,\" Naranjo told Xinhua.",

China has sent two unmanned boats to join a geological survey along its 18,000 km coastline, especially in main coastal zones. Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey has introduced two unmanned boats, developed by Shanghai University, to collect data and take video, which used to be done by surveyors. (Xinhua/Zhang Jiansong) \nChina has sent two unmanned boats to join a geological survey along its 18,000 km coastline, especially in main coastal zones. \nGuangzhou Marine Geological Survey has introduced two unmanned boats, developed by Shanghai University, to collect data and take video, which used to be done by surveyors. \nThe unmanned boats, named Jinghai N0. 3 and Jinghaihong respectively, are carried by China's new-generation offshore fishing ship YUEXIAYU 90215, which has a displacement of 887 tonnes and is equipped with a crane for lifting the boats. \nThe boats have just finished surveying the geological marine condition in Dongmaozhou Islands off Sanya city in Hainan Province, where surveyors failed to carry out a field survey last year after ships ran aground. \nIt was the first time that unmanned boats had been used in such a survey, said senior engineer Wen Mingming from the Guangzhou subsidiary of China Geological Survey. \n\"Many shallow coasts are complicated and likely to leave survey boats stranded. While, the unmanned boats can fit in and eliminate risks for surveyors,\" Wen said. \nJinghai No. 3 is 6.28 meters long and 2.86 meters wide, with a load capacity of 2.6 tonnes and a cruising power of 200 nautical miles. It can conduct automatic topographical mapping, sea floor exploration and environmental monitoring. \nThe 2.7-meter-long Jinghaihong is the newest model developed by the Shanghai University, with a speed of 6 nautical miles per hour. It can perform automatic route planning and navigation while collecting hydrological data. \nShanghai University unmanned vessel research institute is China's first institute for designing and developing such vessels with advanced communication and computing systems. \nGuangzhou Marine Geological Survey is responsible for comprehensive geological survey of coastal zones in Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan provinces, as well as Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.",

      "text": "《TAIPEI TIMES》 More military spending on agenda: Tsai 2017-10-24 03:00 \nPLA TRACKING: The president discussed defense spending with visitors from a US think tank, as the defense ministry tried to reassure the public about PLA exercises near Taiwan \n/ Staff writer, with CNA \nTaiwan will continue to increase military spending as it works to strengthen its national defense capabilities, President Tsai Ing-wen （蔡英文） yesterday told a delegation from a Washington-based think tank, while the Ministry of National Defense said it was closely monitoring Chinese military planes and navy vessels during their exercises near Taiwan. \nMeeting with Hudson Institute president Kenneth Weinstein and others with his group, Tsai said Taiwan maintains stable and close economic and regional security relations with the US. \nAs head of state, one of her priorities is to strengthen Taiwan’s defensive capabilities and promote the development of its defense industry, and the government plans to increase its defense budget to enhance military training and boost military morale, she said. \nTaiwan has made many efforts in this area, Tsai said, adding that she looks forward to receiving suggestions from the institute, particularly in the fields of military reforms and cooperation to strengthen regional peace and stability. \nShe did not give any figures, but in March the government suggested it wanted to increase defense spending from 2 percent of GDP to about 3 percent of GDP, which would mean a 50 percent increase in defense spending. \nHowever, the Ministry of National Defense’s proposed budget for fiscal 2018, which it submitted earlier this month, was for NT$327.8 billion （US$10.83 billion）, an increase of 1.9 percent over its NT$321.7 billion budget for this year. \nMeanwhile, ministry spokesman Chen Chung-chi （陳中吉） said China’s far-sea training activities that bring its fighters and vessels near Taiwan are expected to become routine and the defense forces have a set of response options. \nChen made the remarks in response to reporters’ questions following a news conference in Beijing on Sunday on the sidelines of the Chinese Communist Party’s 19th National Congress on the theme of “solid strides on the path of building a powerful military with Chinese characteristics.” \nPeople’s Liberation Army （PLA） Air Force bomber pilot Liu Rui （劉銳） told the news conference that since the PLA expanded its far-sea training to the deep seas several years ago, it has made such deployments a routine part of its live-fire exercise cycles. \nThe Chinese military would continue to expand its far-sea training, increase the frequency of such training activities and increase the scale of its exercises, Liu said. \nPLA aircraft and vessels have several times flown or sailed near southern Taiwan and into the Western Pacific via the Miyako Strait, which lies between the Japanese islands of Miyako and Okinawa, and is part of Japan’s exclusive economic zone, but includes a narrow band of international waters and airspace. \nChinese fighter jets and ships have also regularly crossed the “first island chain,” which refers to the first major archipelagos off the East Asian continental mainland, including the Japanese archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan and the northern Philippines. \nChen said that the military is closely monitoring the air space and seas above and around Taiwan, and has a range of responses. \nHe also urged the public to support the government’s efforts to develop a more independent defense sector and asymmetric warfare capabilities. \nDominican Republic Minister of Defense Lieutenant General Maximo Delgado, left, meets with President Tsai Ing-wen, right, at the Presidential Office in Taipei yesterday.

[Special coverage] \nWu said the municipality will work for rapid, sustained and healthy development under the guidance of CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping's \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\", and fully translate into reality Xi's instructions given during a visit to the city last year. \n\"Chongqing will establish a moderately well-off society and become an economic center in the Yangtze River's upper reaches, as well as a major modern manufacturing base,\" Wu said. \nTo fulfill Xi's vision, Chongqing will gear up as an inland port and accelerate the formation of an opening-up system that coordinates with international rules and laws. It will also accelerate the development of its pilot free trade area, promote the China-Singapore Chongqing Connectivity Initiative and encourage institutional innovation in such areas as investment and trade facilitation and government services, Wu said. \nAlso, Chongqing will explore the use of international railway supply chains and cross-border highways, and create a law-based, internationalized and enabling climate for investors. It will further boost the capacity and efficiency of the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe regular cargo rail and make it a signature route connecting Asia and Europe. \nCargo will be increased in both directions, cargo sources will be optimized, values per container will rise and two to three train services will be offered daily, Wu said. \nAlso, Chongqing will enhance the Chongqing-Guangxi-Singapore sea-to-rail route to offer western China a new southward access to the sea, he added. \nChongqing will be a point that hosts a high-speed rail network connecting western China to key river deltas in the country and in Southeast Asia, according to Wu. \nIn the waterways, Chongqing will further facilitate commodity trade between the Yangtze region and countries along routes of the Belt and Road Initiative, he said.

      "text": "New Chinese film 'Road to the Sky' tells story of WWII China-Myanmar supply lifeline nicknamed the 'Second Great Wall' By Wei Xi Source:Global Times   17:18:39 New Chinese film tells story of WWII China-Myanmar supply lifeline Promotional material for Road to the Sky Photo: Courtesy of TiHE Communications While for most Chinese today, the Burma Road is nothing more than a name in history books, but for Chinese mainland filmmaker Wang Yi, bringing the history of this vital World War II supply line that connected Kunming in China's Yunnan Province to Lashio in Myanmar (then known as Burma) onto the big screen has been a rewarding endeavor that has taken up the past three years of his life. Despite the fact that his historical feature Road to the Sky has screened at 46 international film festivals abroad, grabbing 23 awards in the process, Wang said that he still feels fortunate that the film will be releasing nationwide in China on Tuesday. Recreating history \"I have TiHE Communication to thank for the release,\" Wang told the Global Times on the phone. Based on the real life story of how people from China and Myanmar worked together to build a 1,154-kilometer-military supply road in just eight months in 1937, Road to the Sky narrows its focus to two villages in South China's Yunnan Province, showing how villagers progress from begrudging reluctance to dedicating themselves entirely to the project. To add to the realism, Oliver Lucas, the film's US producer, even went so far as to purchase some original footage showing construction of the road, shot by a US journalist during World War II, from the US Library of Congress so it could be used in the film. On Saturday, a special prescreening of Road to the Sky was held at the MOMA Broadway Cinema in Beijing. Early reactions from the event have been overwhelmingly positive. \"What impressed me the most is how the film restored history,\" Zu Ge, a primary school teacher, told the Global Times after the prescreening. She explained that while she knew that the film would take some artistic liberties with the source material, she was impressed how real the story felt. \"I learned about this part of history in school. This film brought back those memories and gave me a better understanding of it all.\"Stating that he felt Road to the Sky is a good option for a family film for primary school children and above, Liu Yonghe, a parenting education advocate, said that \"the film provides some very good topics for parents and children to talk about: The experiences that those before us went through, and how that led to the lives we live today, as well as what kind of nation we want to build in the future.\" \"The story in Road to the Sky actually happened. I was only recovering the past,\" Wang explained.Wang pointed out that one major flaw in Chinese films today is that they are often \"unconvincing.\" \"[Though many] US films are fictional stories, they are real in spirit and so are able to convince people that what they are watching is what happened,\" he said. Wang admitted, however, that the less than 10 million yuan ($1.5 million) production is still not perfect and that there were many things he wished he could have done better, such as the film's lighting, music and dialogue. Promotional material for Road to the Sky Photo: Courtesy of TiHE Communications Making room Speaking about why he decided to support the film, Road to the Sky producer He Qin explained that he was inspired by how difficult the Burma Road project was, as it was seen as something of an impossible mission. \"The then Chinese government had asked its UK and US allies for help and was told that it would take six years using modern machinery to build such a road. However, 200,000 villagers, including the elderly, women and children, in Southwest China accomplished this task without advanced technology in just eight months,\" he said, going on to explain that this is why the road is also known as the \"Second Great Wall.\" \"It's estimated that every seven out of the 10 bullets used in major battles in China came from this supply line.\"The importance of the Burma Road is tied to the fact that it was the only land supply line China had during World War II. After the Japanese invaded China in 1937, all the major transportation lines the country had with the outside world were destroyed by the invaders. Though there have been a few other films and TV dramas about the Burma Road made in recent years, such as the seven-episode China Central TV documentary and the 2015 32-episode TV drama Twenty-four Turns , very few works have managed to make a lasting impression on general audiences.Having already traveled to 16 countries and regions for 20 showings of the film, He said that the success of films such as Road to the Sky overseas is a sign that Chinese culture is becoming more accepted. He added that now that China has been increasing its number of screens, he hopes the market make more room for smaller budget films that don't rely on star power to attract audiences.

      "text": "Property market set to continue stabilizing as regulation takes effect, says official Source:Xinhua   22:03:40 China's property market is expected to continue stabilizing in the fourth quarter of this year, a senior government official said on Sunday. The market will continue to see slower growth in transaction volume and stabilizing prices, Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Wang Menghui told a press conference on the sidelines of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. \"For the whole year, the property market will maintain stable performance,\" he said. The government will not waver in its efforts to achieve the goals of property market regulation and will maintain continuity and stability of policies, Wang told reporters. Authorities are studying a \"long-term mechanism\" for real estate regulation and advancing legislative work on the development of the home rental market, he said. Regulatory moves since October last year have had an effect, curbing property buying for speculative and investment purposes and reining in excessively fast price increases, said the minister. He pledged to move faster to put in place a housing system that ensures supply through multiple sources, provides housing support through multiple channels, and encourages both housing purchases and renting. China's rocketing house prices, especially in major cities, had fueled concerns about asset bubbles before dozens of local governments passed or expanded their restrictions on house purchases and increased the minimum down payments. The market was cooled down by relatively tightened liquidity conditions as the government moved to contain leverage and risk in the financial system. Xinhua reported in early October that in North China's Tianjin, most commercial banks' house loan interest rates are 5 to 10 percent higher than the standard interest rate.Of the 70 cities surveyed in August, the pace of new home price growth slowed in 15 of them compared with the same month of last year.

      "text": "Communist Party Congress endorses second term for Xi PTI Tweet Reuters Chinese President Xi Jinping raises his hand as he takes a vote at the closing session of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, China. Reuters A general view shows delegates attending the closing session of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, China. \nXi Jinping along with Premier Li Keqiang ranked number one and two in the Communist Party of China’s hierarchy Beijing, Oct 24: China’s ruling Communist Party today endorsed a second five-year term for President Xi Jinping and appointed a new set of leaders backed by him. 64-year-old Xi’s second term was endorsed by the party at the end of its week-long once-in-a-five-year Congress. The conference attended by over 2,350 delegates ended at the Great Hall of the People, the seat of power of China’s Communist leadership. Xi along with Premier Li Keqiang, 62, ranked number one and two in the Communist Party of China’s hierarchy, would continue based on two five year tenure convention for top leaders. Five new members will be elected to the seven member Standing Committee of the party which rules the country. Xi and Li took over power in 2012 and set to continue till 2022. The new Standing Committee would be unveiled for China and the world tomorrow when they would formally appear in front of the media during a live telecast. Reports in the Hong Kong media said that Xi may not have his way at the Congress as his closest aide Wang Qishan, who led the massive anti-corruption campaign in which Xi’s opponents were allegedly crushed, is likely to step down from the powerful Standing Committee belying speculation that he would be retained by overriding the 68-year retirement rule. Also the Congress may keep the number of the Standing Committee members to seven, contrary to reported preference of Xi to reduce its number to five. The new seven-member committee may retain balance of power among various factions within the party though Xi may still remain powerful with the induction of some of his close associates into the Standing Committee, the reports said. Xi, regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader in recent times heading the party, presidency and the military too is expected to retire by 2022 after his second term. But speculation is rife that he would break that retirement age convention and may continue for a third term considering his powerful stature in the party, equalling that of the party founder Mao Zedong and his successor Deng Xiaoping. Xi also is set to have his own ideological thought enshrined in the CPC Constitution, elevating him to the same political league as Mao and Deng. Former Chinese leaders Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin also had their own ideologies incorporated in the Constitution. But unlike Mao and Deng their names were not included. As China enters a new era, the CPC must write a new chapter of 21st century Marxism with a broader vision to achieve the goals set at the milestone Congress, Chen Shuguang, a professor with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee told state-run Xinhua news agency. Liu attributed the CPC’s success in maintaining vitality and creativity to the ability to advance with the times, saying it is the “magic code” for the CPC to lead China toward becoming a great modern country. The 19th Congress of the CPC which ended today will make great contribution to the world thanks to the concepts mentioned in a key report to the congress, Xinhua quoted analysts as saying. Hu Angang, director of the Center for China Studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said “a community with a shared future for mankind means a community of shared interests and development.”",

      "text": "Xi gets stronger, his thoughts included in Party constitution Tuesday, 24 October 2017 | IANS | Beijing Chinese President Xi Jinping has emerged on par with former leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping with his political ideology being added into the constitution of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The symbolic move came on the final day of a week-long political summit in Beijing , the 19th CPC National Congress, at which Xi, 64, pledged to lead the world's second largest economy into a \"new era\" of international power and influence. With the inclusion of \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\", Xi has surpassed veterans like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Xi is the third Chinese leader after Mao and Deng whose theory will be added to the constitution of the world's largest political party. \"The Congress unanimously agrees on Xi Jinping's 'Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era' in addition to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong, Deng Theory,\" the amendment to the constitution read. \"The Congress urges all Party members to use the Thought to achieve unity in thinking and action, be more purposeful and determined in studying and applying it.\" \"Our party shows strong, firm and vibrant leadership,\" Xi said in a brief address to more than 2,200 delegates. \"Our socialist system demonstrates great strength and vitality. The Chinese people and the Chinese nation embrace brilliant prospects. \"Today we more than 1.3 billion China's people live in jubilation and dignity. Our land radiates with enormous dynamism. Our Chinese civilisation shines with lasting splendour and glamour,\" the Guardian quoted Xi as saying. Since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, only Chairman Mao had been honoured in such a way while still alive, in his case with a political philosophy called Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao founded the People's Republic of China in 1949. Also on Tuesday, the CPC unveiled a new leadership, electing the 19th Central Committee to lead the party for the next five years. The 19th CPC Central Committee will in turn elect the Political Bureau, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and the General Secretary at its first plenary session on Wednesday, reports Xinhua news agency. According to the Party Constitution, the highest leading body of the CPC is the National Congress and the Central Committee it elects, and all constituent organisations and members of the Party are subordinate to the National Congress and the Central Committee.

It is coming from a brotherly country that loves Syria and Lebanon as well,\" he said. \nWang said that the Chinese donation, which expressed China's sympathy and support to the Syrian refugees, aimed at helping Lebanon to deal with the refugee crisis. \n\"We truly wish for the return of the Syrian refugees to their homeland with acceleration of the political solution process in Syria so these refugees can live in a secure, peaceful and prosperous atmosphere,\" the Chinese enovy said.",

It has built facilities such as runways, terminals and parking aprons, attracting 20 aviation firms. \nThe overall market for drones is expected to reach 75 billion yuan (around 11 billion U.S. dollars) by 2025 in China, according to an iResearch report last year. \nIn the booming drone market, researchers and manufacturers need a dedicated place to host test flights for their products. In late August, Shanghai also set up a test flight base for civilian drones. \nLiu said the airspace for industrial drones in Shenyang aviation base will help it become an industrial cluster for producers of unmanned vehicles.

      "text": "Residential developers conscious on investment 24 Oct 2017 at 04:00 38 viewed 0 comments   KANANA KATHARANGSIPORN - + Residential developers remained cautious on investment in the third quarter amid low consumer confidence and slowed economic activities, according to a survey by the Real Estate Information Center (REIC). \nSurachet: Sluggish economy in Q3 \nThe centre reported that the housing developer's expectations index dropped to 61 points in the third quarter from 67 in the second, showing weaker confidence in revenue, presales, investment, employment and new project launches. \nThe lower confidence might be derived from the expectation that economic activities will slow in the early fourth quarter, while development costs might increase. \nThe index also suggested that developers' confidence on presales slightly dropped to 53.1 points from 53.7. The decrease was in line with the consumer confidence index, which remained low due to concerns over the current economic situation. \nBut developers were more confident in revenue in the third quarter as the sentiment index on revenue increased to 53.4 points from 45.4 in the second quarter. \n\"This reflects that developers' adjustments were fruitful. They shifted to investing in the upper-end segment,\" the report said. \"Developers also remained confident in residential demand as sentiment index on demand slightly rose.\" \nFor new project launches, the sentiment index also declined to 59.3 from 60.4, impacting employment, for which the index decreased to 56.2 from 57.4. \nREIC reported that developers remained positive on investment in new projects, albeit more cautiously. They focused on projects in a segment where demand and purchasing power were strong. \nBut the housing developer's sentiment index rose slightly to 54.8 in the third quarter from 53.1 in the second quarter. \nDevelopers' confidence in development costs rose from 40.1 to 45, as prices for construction materials rose, especially cement, which saw higher demand. \nSurachet Kongcheep, associate director of property consultant Colliers International Thailand, said the overall economy in Thailand had not recovered but showed positive signs several months ago with growth in export and tourism arrivals. \n\"The overall economy was still sluggish. People did not feel the economy had improved despite what the government claimed,\" he said. \"Many businesses struggled, like the retail sector, which faced decreasing income among tenants.\" \nIn the office sector, a sluggish economy had a minimal impact as a leasehold contracts were long-term, with advanced bookings of office space throughout the year. Demand for office space remained strong but will be challenged by a large amount of new supply in the future. \nAt least 500,000 square metres of office space is scheduled for completion in the next few years, which might have an impact on average rents. \nIn the condominium sector, most projects launched in the third quarter were along new mass transit lines and extensions where developers introduced units priced 70,000-130,000 baht per sq m. This price range was suited to Bangkok's purchasing power. \nThe average take-up rate for condominiums in Bangkok was 77%, with more than 36,000 units remaining for sale. \nOf this unsold amount, 55% were priced 50,001-100,000 per sq m.

According to reports, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandresekhar Rao wants the upcoming temple at Yadadri to be on par with Andhra Pradesh’s Tirumala, which is the country’s richest temple. A special purpose body for the development of the Yadadri temple has been instated by the government, and it employs around 500 sculptors. Phase-I of this project is expected to be completed by May 2018. As the temple shrine is located among hills, four-lane roads will also be constructed for better connectivity. The temple complex will span 11 acre and will include seven temple domes, with the main dome extending up to 100 ft and tourist facilities that will consist of cottages, parking and housing for priests sprawling across 1,400 acre. As per reports, the temple will have an estimated footfall ranging between 10,000-30,000 per day. The state government is reportedly of the view that the construction of the temple complex will boost economic activity in the region. Tags Cloud",

(Photo/Xinhua) \nAlibaba, JD.com, among high techs to help in nation's development \nChinese internet firms said they are gearing up their pace as General Secretary Xi Jinping's speech gives the economy new impetus to soar through increased innovation and a wave of entrepreneurism. [Special coverage] \nBy leveraging technological prowess and business model innovation, tech giants and startups alike expressed their readiness and confidence to satisfy \"people's ever-growing needs for a better life\". \nJack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group, said entrepreneurs are the \"pivotal forces\" to help ease \"unbalanced and inadequate\" development, which stands in the way of people's pursuit for a better life. \n\"To us, this spells both indispensable responsibilities and huge opportunities,\" he said, adding that companies should utilize their vast resources and financial abundance to bring affluence and promote equal development. \nAlibaba and JD.com, another e-commerce major, have sharpened their focus on precise poverty reduction employing big data technologies. The duo empowered the nation's poverty-stricken population by allowing them to sell local specialties online and boosting sales via digital marketing measures. \n\"Under the guidance of the Party, JD.com is a major beneficiary of the deepened reform and constant improvement of business environment,\" said the company's Party Secretary and Vice-President Long Baozheng. \n\"We will assist the structural supply-side reform and rejuvenate the real economy by opening up our platforms and capabilities, and shoulder more corporate social responsibilities.\" \nChina's new economy, which includes the adoption of information technologies across various sectors, is estimated to account for 12 percent of the country's GDP this year, according to a report published last month by Renmin University of China and China Chengxin Credit Management. \nIn his address to the 19th CPC National Congress, Xi called for more efforts to foster new areas of growth through further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy. \nEric Jing, CEO of fintech giant Ant Financial, said his firm is committed to better serving the real economy through digital means, which effectively lowers financing barriers for smaller merchants and offers easier access to loans. \n\"We will make sure that our payment, wealth management and credit services can improve the welfare of the unbanked and underbanked population, and optimize the operating conditions of hundreds of thousands of mom-and-pop shops,\" he said. \nAgreed Zhong Yongjian, Party secretary of Meituan Dianping, a leading group-buying and dining information platform. He said deepened integration between the internet and the real economy is in accordance with the company's mission to facilitate \"better eating and better living\" through information technologies. \nThe site has poured in resources to Party building in the company, establishing a Party member database and developing a smartphone application that allows them to take online courses and watch broadcasts of Party meetings. \nBike-sharing firm Mobike will continue to firmly implement the major development concepts of \"innovation, coordination, greening, opening up and inclusiveness\", bringing premium services to its 200 million users who favor low-carbon transportation. \n\"We will throw full force into building a smart society by adopting internet of things and artificial intelligence technologies,\" said Wang Xiaofeng, Mobike's co-founder and CEO.

(Photo by Liu Debin/For China Daily) \nGrowth in steel demand is expected to remain subdued in China next year as the government continues to shift its focus from manufacturing to services and steps up environmental protection measures, according to the World Steel Association. \n\"China's steel demand may remain relatively stable in 2018,\" said Wang Guoqing, research director at the Lange Steel Information Research Center. \"Real estate controls and environmental protection measures have weakened steel demand, despite higher demand due to infrastructure investment and mechanical products associated with the Belt and Road Initiative.\" \nDuring the first eight months of this year, China's infrastructure investment grew 19.8 percent compared with the same period last year, and is expected to maintain a higher growth rate for the rest of the year. \nDomestic demand of steel products in the country is expected to see further growth next year, thanks to the robust development of the economy, said Li Xinchuang, deputy secretary-general of the China Iron and Steel Association, who shares a different opinion from that of the World Steel Association. \n\"Next year would be the first year for the country after the 19th CPC National Congress, which will promote economic growth with all strength, resulting in higher steel demand.\" \nThe World Steel Association released its October 2017 Short Range Outlook on Sept 16 and forecast that China's steel demand would increase by 3 percent in 2017, an upward revision over the previous forecast. \nSublime China Information, another steel industry body, has estimated that China's steel consumption would rise 2 percent this year on better consumption from downstream sectors like infrastructure, automobiles and machinery. \nAutomobile sales in the country is expected to reach 29.4 million units in 2017, up 5 percent year-on-year. \nThe World Steel Association expects global steel demand to reach 1,622.1 million metric tons this year and 1,648.1 million tons in 2018. Demand excluding China would rise to 856.4 million tons, up 2.6 percent in 2017 and 882.4 million tons, up 3 percent in 2018. \nT V Narendran, Chairman of the Economics Committee at the World Steel Association, said, \"we expect global growth to moderate in 2018, mainly due to slower growth in China, while in the rest of the world, steel demand will continue to maintain its current momentum.\" \nBoth advanced and developing economies are exhibiting stronger economic momentum this year. Confidence and investment sentiment is improving in a large part of the world despite some financial market volatility and growing concerns of stock market over-valuation, according to the report. \nAlso on a positive note, global trade is gaining momentum despite worries about rising protectionism and talks of rearranging existing free trade agreements.

      "text": "Property market set to continue stabilizing as regulation takes effect, says official Source:Xinhua   22:03:40 China's property market is expected to continue stabilizing in the fourth quarter of this year, a senior government official said on Sunday. The market will continue to see slower growth in transaction volume and stabilizing prices, Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Wang Menghui told a press conference on the sidelines of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. \"For the whole year, the property market will maintain stable performance,\" he said. The government will not waver in its efforts to achieve the goals of property market regulation and will maintain continuity and stability of policies, Wang told reporters. Authorities are studying a \"long-term mechanism\" for real estate regulation and advancing legislative work on the development of the home rental market, he said. Regulatory moves since October last year have had an effect, curbing property buying for speculative and investment purposes and reining in excessively fast price increases, said the minister. He pledged to move faster to put in place a housing system that ensures supply through multiple sources, provides housing support through multiple channels, and encourages both housing purchases and renting. China's rocketing house prices, especially in major cities, had fueled concerns about asset bubbles before dozens of local governments passed or expanded their restrictions on house purchases and increased the minimum down payments. The market was cooled down by relatively tightened liquidity conditions as the government moved to contain leverage and risk in the financial system. Xinhua reported in early October that in North China's Tianjin, most commercial banks' house loan interest rates are 5 to 10 percent higher than the standard interest rate.Of the 70 cities surveyed in August, the pace of new home price growth slowed in 15 of them compared with the same month of last year.

      "text": "Download paper US Military needs during the Cold War induced a mathematical modeling of rational allocation and control processes while simultaneously binding that rationality with computational reality. Modeling strategies to map the optimal to the operational ensued and eventually became a driving force in the development of macroeconomic dynamics. \nKey features of macroeconomics that originated in US military-funded research on applied mathematics in the 1950s and 1960s included recursive optimization taking uncertainty into account, agents modeled as collections of decision rules, and the certainty equivalent and equilibrium modeling strategies. The modeling strategies that opened the door to economists’ agile underpinning of macroeconomics with microfoundations had their own foundation in empirical microeconomics. In the 1950’s the United States Air Force Project SCOOP (Scientific Computation of Optimum Programs) and the Office of Naval Research awarded contracts to establish and maintain a research center for the Planning and Control of Industrial Operations at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. Faced with client demands for computable decision rules that would minimize costs in the face of uncertain demand, the Carnegie team reverse engineered effective computational protocols to derive optimal forms and properties. They also developed procedures to narrow the modeling choices in dynamic programming. The formal analysis of the statistical and mathematical properties of bridges connecting the rational with the computable formed a modeling self- consciousness and channeled a new disciplinary focus on modeling strategies. The rational expectations theorists built on the modeling strategies that had been fabricated for planning in their attempt to bridge aggregative economics with the optimizing behavior of the individual and the clearing capacities of markets. The state-transition models that in the 1970s gave macroeconomists a framework for recursive optimization with uncertainty had similarly transformed control engineering in the 1960s. In both disciplines a “modeling-strategy turn” narrowed the primary analytical focus to the properties of mathematical models with less emphasis on the phenomena being modeled. \nKeywords: modeling strategy, bounded rationality, rational expectations, forecasting, dynamic programming, empirical microeconomics, macroeconomics, operations research, history of economics, Herbert E.

      "text": "Texas Governor to lead trade delegation to India next year PTI Tweet Houston, Oct 24: Texas Governor Greg Abbott is planning to take a trade delegation to India next year as part of his effort to further increase trade and economic ties between the two countries. Abbott made the announcement in this regard during Diwali celebrations for members of the Indian-American community at the Governor’s Mansion in Texas capital, Austin on Sunday. Abbott and first lady Cecilia welcomed over 30 Indo— American community members from Austin, Houston, Dallas and other places, at their sprawling mansion and lighted the ceremonial Diwali lamp. “Diwali lamp has found a permanent home at the governor’s mansion in Austin, this is the third year in a row,” Abbott said. “Diwali and India community’s spirit of victory over evil, light over darkness inclusiveness is very similar to the values of the Americans,” he added. During the celebration, Abbott announced about his plans to lead a trade delegation to India next year as part of his effort to increase bilateral trade and economic ties between the two countries. The mission will focus on increasing trade and investment between Texas and India in a range of sectors. He also expressed admiration and appreciation for the Indian—Americans contribution and voluntarism during Harvey. The way Texans came together and responded to affected people during Harvey is an example, he said. 700 Indian—American volunteers dedicated more than 24,000 hours to Texas during Harvey and together they distributed over 28,000 meals to the locals in need. No rescuer asked about the race or the colour of the person he or she is going to rescue. It was just a service to a fellow human being and that is what matters, he said. Consul General Anupam Ray thanked the governor and the first lady of Texas for opening doors of their mansion on Diwali. Ray also highlighted the accomplishments of Indo—American community in Texas in 2017, including honouring Ian Grillot, having first successful Houston India conference in March 2017 where Texas and Indian businesses, think tank experts came together to increase bilateral trade and investment. India’s purchase of first USD 1 billion worth of gas from Texas, Texas community colleges led by Indo—American firm Cambridge Education partnering to work with Skills India mission, and purchase of USD 100 billion worth of defence equipment and helicopters.",

      "text": "Despite plentiful opinion on the importance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to the economy, entrepreneurs continue to struggle to access loans from the financial system.\nThis is despite the existence of the Magna Carta for MSMEs, a law mandating banks to set aside 8 percent of their loans to\nmicro and small ventures and 2 percent to medium enterprises.\nTheir plight has not escaped the new governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Nestor Espenilla, who promised last week to lay down a plan to improve MSMEs’ access to bank credit and recast outdated policies that result in banks charging unnecessary risk premiums on small businesses needing loans for their operations. ADVERTISEMENT\n“MSMEs are unable to reach their full potential due to a range of barriers, including financial access,” the central bank chief noted. Bank lending to MSMEs truly leaves much to be desired, comprising only 8.4 percent of the banking industry’s total loan portfolio.\nGiven the difficulty in accessing bank financing, 80 percent of small businesses are internally financed, unlike large corporations that borrow billions of pesos at substantially lower interest rates.\nA Deloitte-Visa survey noted as early as 2015 the difficulty of small enterprises in accessing bank credit. It noted that total bank loans extended to small and medium-sized Philippine enterprises amounted to only $9 billion in 2014, compared to Thailand’s $171 billion — the highest in the region.\nPersonal funds were the dominant source of financing among these smaller firms. The survey also cited many nonfinancing challenges faced by small and medium-sized firms, among them rising business costs, difficulty of finding quality labor, intensifying competition, unstable demand and the multitude of government regulations.\nThe survey found that access to financing was a key challenge for local SMEs, with most Philippine lenders requiring collateral before extending credit, citing other financing barriers such as slow fund disbursement due to lack of credit information, lack of bank and government guidance on the preparation of compliance documents, and high interest on loans due to risks faced by banks.\nGovernor Espenilla noted that MSMEs made up 99.5 percent of all registered businesses in the Philippines and contributed the biggest share of total jobs generated at 61.6 percent.\nDespite this, small businesses accounted for only 35.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\n“At the BSP, we are troubled by these numbers and take them seriously,” Espenilla said, adding that they were working hard to provide the regulatory environment that would create a more inclusive financial system. ADVERTISEMENT\nThe intention of Espenilla’s plan is for banks to focus on cash flow analysis and ability to pay rather than collateral when determining a borrower’s creditworthiness. Indeed, collateral—particularly real estate — should play only a secondary role in credit decisions.\nAnd Espenilla promised that under the new framework he would lay down, MSMEs that are “fundamentally good businesses” would be able to access cheap loans even without collateral.\nThis can easily tie in with the BSP governor’s earlier policy statement to release more money into the growing economy. He wants to reduce banks’ statutory reserves to single digits from their current level of 20 percent of total deposits held in the BSP’s vaults.\nA lower reserve requirement for banks will free up the idle cash for more productive uses, like lending to job-generating activities.\nEach percentage point cut in the reserve requirement frees up as much as P70 billion of these deposits. In effect, a reduction to single-digit levels has the potential to release into the financial system more than P700 billion in cash over the medium term.\nWe hope a big portion of this will go to finance the productive operations of MSMEs and, as a result, generate new jobs and eventually help uplift the living conditions of many of those dependent on these homegrown enterprises.\nSubscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

PTI | Last Updated: Oct 24, 2017, 10:22 AM IST \nMumbai: The benchmark BSE Sensex gained over 156 points in early trade on Tuesday as investors widened their positions ahead of quarterly earnings from some bluechip companies amid positive Asian cues. \nMoreover, continuous buying by domestic financial institutions also supported trading sentiment. \nThe 30-share index gathered 156.24 points, or 0.48 percent, to 32,662.96 with all the sectoral indices led by oil & gas, realty, PSU and metal trading higher. \nThe gauge had rallied 116.76 points in the previous session. \nThe NSE index Nifty too climbed 34.25 points, or 0.33 percent, to trade above the 10,200-mark at 10,219.10. \nBrokers said fresh spell of buying by investors ahead of quarterly earnings from Infosys and a few other bluechip companies later in the day and a firming trend at other Asian bourses buoyed trading sentiment here. \nMajog gainers were ONGC, NTPC, Tata Steel, Hindustan Unilever, Axis Bank, Asian Paint, ICICI Bank, Coal India, SBI, Maruti Suzuki, Wipro and Power Grid, rising up to 2.42 percent. \nDomestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth Rs 307.84 crore in yesterday's trade, as per provisional data issued by the stock exchanges. \nAmong other Asian markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.12 percent and Japan's Nikkei gained 0.17 percent, while Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.09 percent in early trade today. \nThe US Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, shed 0.23 percent in yesterday.

      "text": "KIET report shows that preferential duties in KORUS FTA had little effect on export increases Posted on : Oct.23,2017 16:52 KST Modified on : Oct.23,2017 16:52 KST Hyundai cars are lined up on a shipping pier at the Hyundai Motors’ Port waiting to be loaded onto a ship for export. SK trade authorities plan to use the findings to counter claims that the agreement is unfair South Korean trade authorities submitted empirical analysis findings to Washington showing that preferential US duties as part of the South Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) had almost no direct effect on the increase in South Korean exports to the US over the past five years. The findings are expected to be used as major support in the two sides’ amendment negotiations to counter Washington’s claims that the agreement is unfair and beneficial only to South Korea. An Oct. 22 Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET) report titled “Analysis of FTA Effects by Industry” included results from a quantitative analysis of the effects of preferential FTA duties (abolition or reduction) on South Korean exports of 12 major manufacturing items to the US in the period (2007-16) before and after the agreement took effect in Mar. 2012. The findings indicates that the effects of preferential duties were not statistically significant for 11 of the items, including automobiles, steel, general machinery, and agriculture/forestry/fishing products. It was the first-ever empirical analysis purely focused on the effects of the agreement’s concessions on exports after eliminating the three factors of US consumer income levels, changes in trade, and exchange rate fluctuation. South Korean trade authorities previously submitted the findings to the US while negotiating during the second session of the two sides’ joint KORUS FTA committee in Washington on Oct. 4. The analysis also found that the actual average US import duty rate for South Korean manufacturing products fell from 1.2% in 2012 to 0.4% last year, but rose slightly from 1.6% (the World Trade Organization’s most-favored nation duty rate) to 1.7% over an equivalent period when the FTA did not exist. “While imports of South Korean automobiles, steel, general machinery, and other manufacturing items have increased substantially in the US market over the past five years, the analysis showed no major correlation with the reduction of duties according to the agreement,” KIET said. “Based on the absence of a large difference between the actual duty rate and the decrease in duties when there was no agreement, the decrease in duties does not appear to have led to an increase in exports of South Korean items,” it added. The institute further said the “decline in the FTA usage rate as factors such as administrative costs for place-of-origin certification functioned as transactional expenses for exporting businesses also stems from the minor effect of preferential duties.” The Office of the Minister for Trade reportedly began work with state economic think tanks on Oct. 11 to examine scenarios for potential impacts on the South Korean economy if the FTA comes to an end.

      "text": "Tajkistan / Economy / Trade possibilities spurring rapprochement between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Trade possibilities spurring rapprochement between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan 14:17, сегодня Автор: EurasiaNet.org 0 0 0 116 \nAn exhibition of Tajik industrial goods that took place at the UzExpoCenter exhibition hall in Tashkent this month was a response to an analogous event in April organized for Uzbek exporters looking to expand their market in Tajikistan. \nThere was particular excitement at the stand for Italian denim company Carrera, which has a factory in Tajikistan. Visitors were especially struck by the low prices for men’s jeans — at $12 apiece, they would compete well in the Uzbek market. \nThe company representative at the Carrera stand explained that all their denim goods are manufactured with Tajik cotton. Around 90 percent of their Tajik output, which ranges from jeans to shirts and jackets, is at the moment sent to Italy and then exported onward to markets in Western Europe. \nEurasiaNet.org notes that prior to this year, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan for the best part of two decades had engaged in a low-level cold war. Thus, the sense of novelty about the goodwill exchange is strong. \nA member of the Tajik delegation, Dushanbe-based entrepreneur Abdumavlon Abdulloyev, told EurasiaNet.org that he last visited Uzbekistan in 1985, when he was 33 years old. \nAbdulloyev’s company processes cotton and produces a wide range of clothes, from overalls for manual laborers to school uniforms. For him, as for many Tajik manufacturers, the prospect of gaining a foothold in Uzbekistan’s populous and geographically convenient market is appealing. \nHis Uzbek partner, Jamallidin Yakubov, however, was slightly more circumspect and said that although the countries may be growing closer on a diplomatic level, lots of details need to be addressed to boost imports and exports. \nSlapping punishing tariffs on imports was the late President Islam Karimov’s notion of how to keep external competition at bay. His successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has embarked on a radically different approach to trade and is seeking to simplify life for exporters and importers alike. \nAs long as Karimov was in power, it would have been inconceivable to stage any such fairs. Fazliddin Abdiyev, a 23-year-old shoe manufacturer form Tajikistan, told EurasiaNet.org that not only was he visiting Uzbekistan for the first time, but that the idea of traveling to Tashkent had never even crossed his mind before. Abdiyev said he is dipping his toe into the Uzbek market to see what the competition is like. \n“We produce quality wares with Turkish equipment. Our military-style boots should find demand among Uzbek businesses. They are really in with young people right now,” Abdiyev said. \nMeanwhile, economist Yuliy Yusupov noted that even though the barrier for bilateral trade is coming down, administrative obstacles, including the visa regime and import tariffs, remain in place. Earlier this month, Uzbekistan lifted visa requirements for Tajik citizens visiting the country for a single day, but longer stays still require completing onerous paperwork and an $18 visa fee. \n“One key problem of the Tajik economy is the excessively high rate of the Tajik currency, on account of all the remittances from migrants. The somoni is depreciating more slowly than inflation is increasing, and that means the real exchange rate is increasing. In real terms, Tajik goods are getting more expensive, and imports getting cheaper,” Yusupov told EurasiaNet.org . \nTajik journalist Muzaffar Yunusov, for his part, said that the high tariff wall has fueled a robust trade in contraband goods. Black marketeers take meat, potatoes and cigarettes from Tajikistan across the border. Flowers, tomatoes and fuel go the other way. \nBilateral trade between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan rose by 17.8 percent year-on-year in 2016 to $197 million, according to Uzbek government figures. The figure for the first nine months of this year is already $178.2 million, indicating that this year will be significantly better than last. Toggle navigation",

      "text": "* Composite, services PMIs below all poll forecasts\n* Manufacturing PMI above all poll forecasts\n* PMI points to Q3 GDP growth of 0.6-0.7 pct -IHS Markit (Adds comment, detail)\nBy Jonathan Cable\nLONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Private sector growth across the euro zone slowed more sharply than predicted this month, a survey showed on Tuesday, but activity remained strong even though firms increased prices at the steepest rate in over six years.\nIHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for October, seen as a good guide to overall economic growth, fell to 55.9 from September's 56.7, still comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.\nOctober's reading was below all expectations in a Reuters poll, which had forecast a more modest dip to 56.5, but was still much higher than it has averaged in recent years.\n\"Despite declining in October, the euro zone Composite PMI suggests that the economic recovery continued at a healthy pace at the start of Q4,\" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.\nGermany's private sector posted the highest increase in new orders in 6-1/2 years in October, implying Europe's largest economy started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. France's business rebound meanwhile showed no sign of slowing as activity rose more than expected.\n\"Based on the German and French figures, the average PMI for Spain and Italy probably fell, perhaps because issues in Catalonia weighed on business activity in Spain,\" Brown said.\nCatalonia's independence drive and its potential fallout has affected markets. Madrid has said it will impose direct rule on the region, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy.\nIHS Markit said the PMI, if maintained, pointed to fourth quarter economic growth of 0.6-0.7 percent in the euro zone, faster than the 0.5 percent a recent Reuters poll predicted.\nThe robust growth came as firms jacked up prices. The output prices index climbed to 53.3 from 52.7, its highest since June 2011.\nInflation has stubbornly refused to reach the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling but a recent Reuters poll predicted policymakers will say on Thursday they plan to start trimming monthly asset purchases in January.\nA PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry sank to 54.9 from 55.8, missing all expectations in a Reuters poll that predicted a reading of 55.6.\nBut suggesting firms think the slowdown won't last, they hired staff at the second fastest rate in over nine years. The employment index rose to 54.3 from 53.7 and has only been higher once -- in March -- since early 2008.\nManufacturing growth, on the other hand, accelerated. The factory PMI came in at 58.6 compared to September's 58.1, its highest since February 2011. It was forecast at 57.8 and was better than anyone polled by Reuters predicted.\nAn index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, dipped to 58.7 from 59.2.\nIndicating the momentum might continue, new orders picked up. The sub index was 58.7 compared to September's 58.5, matching a more than six-year high set in June.\n\"With new orders increasing and export demand picking up, the underlying detail provided enough encouragement for another robust start to the quarter,\" said Bert Colijn at ING.

      "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Financial guarantee insurer, Danajamin Nasional Bhd, and Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd (BPMB) have collaborated to co-guarantee the issuance of an 18-year, RM639 million Senior Sukuk Murabahah (Sukuk) by TRIplc Bhd’s unit, TRIplc Medical Sdn Bhd (TMSB). \nIn a statement today, Danajamin said, the guarantee marked its second guarantee facility extended to the TRIplc group after the previous sukuk issuance for the construction of Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Puncak Alam, Selangor. \n“The funds raised from the issuance of the Sukuk will be used primarily to part-finance the project’s cost of the new teaching hospital and medical academic centre development in UiTM’s existing campus in Puncak Alam,” it said. \nIt said the Sukuk was rated ‘AA1/stable’ by RAM Rating Services Bhd premised on the support from the co-guarantors’ irrevocable and unconditional financial guarantee during the construction period. \n“This means that the guarantee will not be required once the project has been completed,” it said. \nDanajamin Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mohamed Nazri Omar, said the company would continue to be innovative in how it applied its financial guarantee to create rating diversity and at the same time find new ways to bring developmental as well as economic impact to Malaysia. \n“For the past eight years, Danajamin has brought a total of 18 first-time bond/sukuk issuers into the market and has provided its guarantee for bond/sukuk programmes issued by a total of 32 viable Malaysian corporations across various sectors. \n“To-date Danajamin has brought about a market impact of approximately RM16 billion,” he said. \nBPMB’s President/Group CEO, Shaharuddin Zainuddin, said the bank’s participation in this project reflected its continued commitment to provide financing to the four mandated sectors – infrastructure, oil and gas, maritime and technology. \n“We had approved financing totalling RM7.2 billion for 33 private finance initiative projects in the country mainly in infrastructure which include education and healthcare sectors, to-date,” he said. – BERNAMA",

      "text": "October 24, 2017 / 7:25 AM / Updated an hour ago France to discuss possible new Rafale sale with Egypt's al-Sisi: Le Maire Reuters Staff 2 Min Read PARIS (Reuters) - France will discuss the possible sale of more Rafale aircrafts with Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi during his visit to Paris this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Europe 1 radio on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire meets with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (not pictured) at Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, June 12, 2017. REUTERS/Costas Baltas Under the previous government, France had concluded several major military agreements with Egypt, including the sale of 24 Rafale combat aircraft, a multi-mission frigate and two Mistral warships in contracts worth some 6 billion euros. The 2015 Rafale contract - the first export contract for the jet - included the option of selling another twelve aircrafts. “If there can be new contracts, so much the better. That will be discussed today by the President of the Republic (Macron) and the president (Sisi),” said Le Maire, when asked by Europe 1 radio to comment on reports that the sale of the extra 12 aircrafts was on the table but that his ministry was reluctant because of the payment terms asked for by Egypt. “It is normal that Bercy (the French finance ministry) would want to make sure Egypt should be able to pay its plane orders,” Le Maire said. Sisi is in Paris until Oct 25. “As far as human rights are concerned, of course we’ll discuss that. I have no doubt that the President of the Republic will mention the issue of human rights when he has lunch with his Egyptian counterpart,” added Le Maire. Rafale-maker Dassault Aviation declined to comment. France and Egypt have nurtured closer economic and military ties in recent years, and with Sisi’s rise to power that relationship has improved with both sides concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt. But human rights organisations at home and overseas have accused France under Macron of remaining silent in the face of increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi’s government, as the 2018 presidential elections approach.

Reuters | October 24, 2017, 07:58 IST Newsletter A A \nMILAN- Enel's green power unit leads a consortium selected as preferred bidder to build a 100 megawatt solar farm in Ethiopia , the Italian utility said on Monday, in its first foray in the country. \nEnel, the biggest private renewable energy player in Africa, said the consortium would invest around $120 million in the project. \nThe consortium includes Ethiopian infrastructure company Orchid Business Group, it said. \n\"Ethiopia has all the potential to become a key market for Enel's strategy in Africa,\" Enel Green Power boss Antonio Cammisecra said. \nEthiopia, Africa's most populous state after Nigeria, has an annual economic growth rate of around 10 percent but still has one of the lowest electrification rates on the continent. \nEnel, which controls Spain's Endesa, is keen to expand in Africa where it already operates in Zambia, Morocco , Kenya , Senegal and South Africa .

      "text": "Criticism, regulatory tightening to weigh on share price: experts 1 2017-10-24 09:44 Global Times Editor: Li Yan ECNS App Download \nChinese online lender Qudian Inc is under fire in China after what observers said was a less-than-impressive interview by its CEO Luo Min Sunday that was aimed fending off criticism of the company's business practices. The critics said it could instead exacerbate the company's domestic image and hurt its share price. \nQudian had a great week on Wall Street after its debut on the New York Stock Exchange raised $900 million on Wednesday, but Chinese experts on Monday painted a dim picture for the company's shares, citing domestic challenges such as criticism and expectations of tight regulations for the online lending sector. \nFollowing its splashy debut in the U.S., Qudian was the subject of many negative news reports, mostly from popular social media accounts, about its business model, with some questioning its practice of targeting students for loans and others even describing the company as a \"loan shark\" - lending money at usurious rates. \nIn an apparent bid to respond to these criticisms, Qudian CEO Luo Min participated in an interview with online technology reporter Lu Hongyan, addressing what Lu described as two types of criticisms: \"[the company's] business insecurity and moral disgrace.\" \nIn the interview, which Lu published on his WeChat account in question-and-answer form, Luo acknowledged that the company had targeted students for its loans prior to 2015 but stopped the practice after the government intervened. He added that, though there were other legal ways to lend to students, the company \"was afraid of doing it\" because \"we are afraid of public pressure.\" \nLuo also touted his company's robust consumer data system and risk control mechanisms, which he said had helped the company to weed out risky borrowers and keep the company's bad debt ratio and losses low. \n\"Our bad loan ratio is below 0.5 percent, that's very low. So we can afford it when those people don't pay up… Losses have been contained at a low level,\" Luo said. \nBut part of the interview drew much attention and even mockery. Luo said, \"Loans that weren't paid on time were considered dead accounts. We never pushed people to pay back. We don't even call. If you don't pay back, then never mind, we'll just give it to you as a gift.\" \nLuo's claims of not following up on overdue loans and reclassifying them as gifts were mocked on social media as unprofessional and hypocritical. \n\"Please forgive me, I laughed reading this … I think this interview is a serious failure [of public relations], fully exposing the founder's lack of professionalism,\" Chu Zihang, director of investment at Shanghai-based Woofoo Capital, wrote on Monday on zhihu.com, a popular online commentary site. \n\"It is the first time that I heard a founder of a lending institution say that delinquencies are dead accounts… and about risk control; In Luo's logic, if the company won't collect overdue loans, that means it has abandoned post-lending risk control,\" Chu told the Global Times on Monday. \nLiu Dingding, an independent technology analyst, also said that the CEO's comments on overdue loans \"weren't clearly thought through.\" \n\"In such a climate where top leaders in the country have been repeatedly calling for efforts to fight systemic financial risks and there have been a lot of risks and problems exposed in the consumer lending sector… the CEO should keep a low profile, but he went on to say it so publicly… that's very inappropriate,\" Liu told the Global Times. \nHe said such high-profile acts from Luo and other investors such as Zhou Yahui, an early investor of Qudian, would draw a lot of heat from regulators at a hyper-sensitive time and exacerbate the company's situation. \nLiu added that foreign investors were enthusiastic about Qudian's IPO because they knew they could make short-term gains by flipping the shares, but given the company's domestic challenges, the stock price will drop soon. \n\"I think we don't have to wait long, the company's share price will almost certainly fall sharply in the coming days,\" Liu said.

      "text": "The dollar touched a three-month high against the yen on Monday, as investors bet the overwhelming election victory for Japan’s ruling party would mean a continuation of “Abenomics,” the ultra-easy policies that have kept downward pressure on the yen.\nThe US dollar traded close to a 2-1/2 week high against a basket of six major currencies. Traders have been speculating that the next head of the Federal Reserve could take a more hawkish stance on monetary policy.\nRenewed expectations of federal tax cuts have also supported the US dollar and stoked a rise in US bond yields, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year peak at 1.589 per cent.\n\n“The common trait is higher US yields. You have the whole Fed chair debate and the fiscal situation,” said Alan Ruskin, global co-head of FX strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Monday he is “very, very close” to making his decision on who should chair the Fed and was considering at least three people: Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor and current Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\nSpeculators pared net bearish bets on the dollar to their lowest level in more than a month, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.\nAbe promises to deal with North Korea ‘firmly’ after landslide win in Japan’s election \nThe dollar index was last up 0.22 per cent at 93.910, below a session peak of 94.017.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition kept its two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house with a total of 313 seats in its election win on Sunday.\nAbe’s victory eased fears that the economic steps implemented under his leadership, including an expansive asset-purchase programme by the Bank of Japan, would be disrupted and halt the yen’s depreciation against the dollar.\nThe dollar gained as much as half a per cent to 114.10 yen on the EBS trading platform, its strongest since July 11. It was last up 0.1 per cent at 113.69 yen.\nArticle 155: How Spain is taking control of Catalan powers \nThe euro fell 0.4 per cent to US$1.17420, holding below a 2-1/2-year peak of US$1.2092 reached on September 8, on anxiety about Madrid’s handling of civil unrest in Catalonia following a referendum on the region’s independence on October 1.\nThe single currency was on its back foot ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday. Traders were betting on a more hawkish stance from the ECB offset by hints it is not in a rush to tighten policy.",

If we prohibit new innovations or transactions, we will lose opportunities to build the new [crowdfunding] ecosystem to drive the country towards the Thailand 4.0 policy,\" said Mrs Tipsuda. \nAn ICO is a type of fund-raising scheme that is increasingly becoming popular among tech startups, enterprises and investors. \nICO transactions are similar to crowdfunding, where an issuer presents a business model to investors, but the difference is that the raised funds are in the form of digital currencies using blockchain technology, and the contracts are enforced under smart contracts. \nMrs Tipsuda said the capital market needs people who will take care of an investment banker's role for ICO transactions. \nThose parties will be responsible for three key roles: reading the white papers offered by ICO issuers and verifying whether the business model makes sense; verifying and enforcing the source code of smart contracts; and conducting the \"know-your-customer\" process for transparency. \nIn the first stage, the SEC will allow retail investors to put up to 300,000 baht per company in ICO funding, said Mrs Tipsuda. \n\"There is one trading portal that has shown interest and many startups have also expressed enthusiasm for ICO funding,\" she said. \nMrs Tipsuda said the public hearing process is expected to be completed and ready for implementation before the Fintech Act goes into effect. \nThe Fintech Act is in the revision process, after which it will be proposed to the National Legislative Assembly. \nThe Act is expected to be implemented next year. \nThe SEC is also in the process of revising the SEC Act to allow operations of the new electronic trading platform.

      "text": "* Spot gold may break resistance at $1,283/oz - technicals * Market focus turns to Fed leadership * Dollar edges away from 3-month peak vs yen (Adds comment, updates prices) By Apeksha Nair Oct 24 (Reuters) - Gold inched up on Tuesday on the back of a slightly weaker dollar, but traded in a tight range amid possibilities of an early announcement on the next U.S. Federal Reserve chair. Spot gold was up 0.1 percent at $1,282.80 an ounce by 0337 GMT, after hitting its lowest since Oct. 6 at $1,271.86 in the previous session. U.S. gold futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,284.60 per ounce. \"Nothing really spurring a big selloff for gold yet. We're waiting for currency direction... maybe people are anxious about an early announcement from Trump on the Fed chair,\" said a Hong Kong-based trader. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies and the yen , after climbing to a more than three-month high against the latter in the previous session, as attention turned to who would be the next Fed chairman. President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday he is \"very, very close\" to making his decision on who should chair the Fed. He is said to be considering Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor for the position. Current Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, was one of the five candidates Trump interviewed for the job. A less hawkish candidate would be expected to favour lower interest rates, reducing the value of the dollar and making the greenback-denominated metal cheaper for holders of other currencies. The Fed will raise interest rates in December and twice next year, according to a Reuters poll of economists showed, who now worry that the central bank will slow its tightening because of expectations that inflation will remain low. \"I'm very surprised we're up here. Risk is still on if you look at stock markets. Generally gold should be lower... I was expecting gold to drift down to $1,260 area,\" said the Hong Kong-based trader. \"We'll probably consolidate around $1,275-$1,285 until some Fed news comes out.\" Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao, however, said spot gold may break a resistance at $1,283 per ounce and rise into a range of $1,289-$1,295.

      "text": "Despite plentiful opinion on the importance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to the economy, entrepreneurs continue to struggle to access loans from the financial system.\nThis is despite the existence of the Magna Carta for MSMEs, a law mandating banks to set aside 8 percent of their loans to\nmicro and small ventures and 2 percent to medium enterprises.\nTheir plight has not escaped the new governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Nestor Espenilla, who promised last week to lay down a plan to improve MSMEs’ access to bank credit and recast outdated policies that result in banks charging unnecessary risk premiums on small businesses needing loans for their operations. ADVERTISEMENT\n“MSMEs are unable to reach their full potential due to a range of barriers, including financial access,” the central bank chief noted. Bank lending to MSMEs truly leaves much to be desired, comprising only 8.4 percent of the banking industry’s total loan portfolio.\nGiven the difficulty in accessing bank financing, 80 percent of small businesses are internally financed, unlike large corporations that borrow billions of pesos at substantially lower interest rates.\nA Deloitte-Visa survey noted as early as 2015 the difficulty of small enterprises in accessing bank credit. It noted that total bank loans extended to small and medium-sized Philippine enterprises amounted to only $9 billion in 2014, compared to Thailand’s $171 billion — the highest in the region.\nPersonal funds were the dominant source of financing among these smaller firms. The survey also cited many nonfinancing challenges faced by small and medium-sized firms, among them rising business costs, difficulty of finding quality labor, intensifying competition, unstable demand and the multitude of government regulations.\nThe survey found that access to financing was a key challenge for local SMEs, with most Philippine lenders requiring collateral before extending credit, citing other financing barriers such as slow fund disbursement due to lack of credit information, lack of bank and government guidance on the preparation of compliance documents, and high interest on loans due to risks faced by banks.\nGovernor Espenilla noted that MSMEs made up 99.5 percent of all registered businesses in the Philippines and contributed the biggest share of total jobs generated at 61.6 percent.\nDespite this, small businesses accounted for only 35.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\n“At the BSP, we are troubled by these numbers and take them seriously,” Espenilla said, adding that they were working hard to provide the regulatory environment that would create a more inclusive financial system. ADVERTISEMENT\nThe intention of Espenilla’s plan is for banks to focus on cash flow analysis and ability to pay rather than collateral when determining a borrower’s creditworthiness. Indeed, collateral—particularly real estate — should play only a secondary role in credit decisions.\nAnd Espenilla promised that under the new framework he would lay down, MSMEs that are “fundamentally good businesses” would be able to access cheap loans even without collateral.\nThis can easily tie in with the BSP governor’s earlier policy statement to release more money into the growing economy. He wants to reduce banks’ statutory reserves to single digits from their current level of 20 percent of total deposits held in the BSP’s vaults.\nA lower reserve requirement for banks will free up the idle cash for more productive uses, like lending to job-generating activities.\nEach percentage point cut in the reserve requirement frees up as much as P70 billion of these deposits. In effect, a reduction to single-digit levels has the potential to release into the financial system more than P700 billion in cash over the medium term.\nWe hope a big portion of this will go to finance the productive operations of MSMEs and, as a result, generate new jobs and eventually help uplift the living conditions of many of those dependent on these homegrown enterprises.\nSubscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

      "text": "UK factory orders grow at slowest rate in 11 months October 24, 2017 Send to Friend \nLONDON: Growth in British factory orders slowed to its weakest in almost a year this month, a monthly survey from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed on Monday, though firms were working at their closest to full capacity in 20 years. The CBI’s factory order book balance unexpectedly fell this month to -2, its lowest since November 2016, from +7 in September, below all expectations in a Reuters poll that on average forecast it would rise to +9. Output expectations fell to +19 from +28, the lowest since April, while export orders grew at the weakest since July — though both these still pointed to above-average growth. “We’ve seen a general softening in manufacturing activity over the past three months, with the outlook for investment becoming more subdued,” the CBI’s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, said.However, the Bank of England is likely to home in on the fact that firms said they were working at their closest to full capacity since October 1997, as it considers whether to raise interest rates next week. “While October’s survey was disappointingly weak, it doesn’t change the picture of the manufacturing sector on course for a better performance than in recent years,” Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics said. The BoE fears domestic inflation pressures are likely to increase due to capacity constraints - partly due to the effect of Brexit on immigration — and the CBI said firms reported the biggest shortage of unskilled labour since July 2004. Brexit transition Earlier on Monday, it emerged that the CBI and four other major business organisations are drafting a letter urging Britain’s government to secure urgently a Brexit transition deal or risk losing jobs and investment. Quarterly data published by the CBI alongside the monthly factory orders figures showed businesses plan to invest in new buildings at the slowest rate since July 2009.However, plans for investment in machinery, research and development and staff training were at or above past average levels. Overall, optimism about the business situation was its weakest since just after last year’s Brexit vote.Meanwhile the British households’ financial worries have eased to their lowest since June, despite the prospect of higher Bank of England interest rates and a reliance on borrowing to make up for falling employment income, a survey showed on Monday.The IHS Markit Household Finance Index rose to 43.8 in October from 42.8 in September, its highest since June, and marking a recovery from a third quarter which was the weakest since 2014.Since its launch in 2009, the survey has never exceeded the 50 mark that would indicate an improved financial situation.Markit said the survey’s improvement this month reflected households’ increased optimism about the economic outlook for the next year, as well as an increased willingness to spend on cars, holidays and household large goods.However, despite increased workplace activity and a softening in inflation expectations, households reported a fall in income for the first time since January.“The gap between rising spending and falling income may have been bridged with increased borrowing,” the report said. “Latest data also suggested easier access to unsecured debt.”A separate survey by the EEF trade association and the bank Santander, also released on Monday, showed that investment had slowed this year but the proportion of manufacturers planning to invest more over the next two years had risen to 51 per cent from 43 per cent in 2016.“With global demand on the up conditions should be ripe for industry to make new investments in capacity and productivity enhancing technology.

      "text": "Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group's asset management arm is expected to see a huge demand of over Rs 15,000 crore from anchor investors against the earmarked book size of Rs 462 crore for them under its forthcoming IPO , merchant banking sources said. \n\nThe firm has fixed a price band of Rs 247-252 per equity share. At the upper end of the price band, the share sale would garner Rs 1,542.42 crore. \n\nIt will be the first initial share sale by a major asset management company ( AMC ) in India though smaller rival UTI Mutual Fund 's IPO plans have been in the works for a long time. \n\nIt will also be the first initial public offer (IPO) from the Reliance Group after Reliance Power in 2008. Other listed firms of the group included Reliance Capital, Reliance Home Finance, RCOM, Reliance Infra and Reliance Naval & Engineering. \n\nAccording to merchant banking sources, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Company ( RNAM ) has received great response from investors for its initial share sale during the recent roadshows. \n\nThe company is expected to see demand worth more than Rs 15,000 crore for the shares on offer for anchor investors, they added. \n\nThe portion allocated for anchor investors is worth Rs 462 crore. The anchor book subscription will be open on October 24. \n\nFurther, more than 50 global anchor investors have already applied for anchor allocation portion from the US, Japan, Singapore and India. These include sovereign wealth funds , mutual fund houses and private insurance companies. \n\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity International, DE Shaw, Morgan Stanley, HDFC Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund , DSP BlackRock Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz are among the anchor investors that approached RNAM's for anchor portion. \n\nRNAM's IPO will be open for public subscription on October 25-27. The public issue comprises fresh issuance of 2.45 crore shares, besides an offer for sale of 3.67 crore shares by Reliance Capital and Nippon Life Insurance Company. \n\nReliance Capital and Nippon Life will each dilute three per cent stake. The IPO size will be around 10 per cent of the post issue paid-up capital of the company. \n\nJM Financial, CLSA, Nomura and Axis Capital are the global coordinators and book running lead managers for the initial share sale. \n0 Comments",

PFC Chairman and Managing Director Satnam Singh also said the company would carve out a separate unit – Facilitation Group - to finance such coal mine acquisitions. The state-run lender may form a subsidiary for such proposals in the future. \"At present there is no plan to float any such subsidiary, but later we will see,\" Singh said.

      "text": "The real estate investment industry’s most important lessons from 2007’s financial crash \nRisk, particularly, must never again come at the expense of responsible investment PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 24 October, 2017, 11:02am UPDATED : Tuesday, 24 October, 2017, 11:02am Hong Kong banks’ profits slide the most since 2008 financial crisis 29 Jan 2016 \nTen years on from the global financial crisis, risk must never again come at the expense of responsible investment. \nThis year has been full of tenth-anniversary stories marking the start of the global financial crisis and the painful memories it dredges up for many. \nFrom the run on Northern Rock bank in the UK, to Bear Stearns’ profits collapsing in the US, 2017 has given us plenty of reminders of those dark days a decade ago. \nAnd the role of real estate investment within that crisis cannot be forgotten. \nInvestors then had a far-simpler approach to risk management, welcoming more and more risk in the perennial search for greater returns. \nThis lax attitude and the endemic spread of over-leveraged portfolios took the entire system to the edge of collapse. \nOur industry has changed a great deal since then. Risk management is given much more attention now than it was a decade ago. Specialist teams have grown, investors now make better use of research within the risk-management process and we’ve seen the introduction of new, effective quantitative modelling techniques. \nIndeed, 90 per cent of senior investors we asked as part of our Global Investment Risk Perspectives 2017 report, released this month, thought the global financial crash of 2007/8 had acted as a catalyst for positive change in the field of risk management. \nBut challenges remain. We are seeing compressed yields in many major markets once again. \nSome are even trading on yields close to all-time lows. These, combined with new all-time highs in real estate investment volumes, have pulled investors further up the risk curve in a bid for greater returns. \nThis can’t be ignored and has led to a boom in investment in alternative assets. Hotels, student accommodation and purpose-built rental blocks, for instance, are all attracting unprecedented levels of investment from companies looking to carve out a new niche. \nIn Hong Kong, we see this same trend with increased competition from mainland developers pushing land prices up massively. This has forced local developers and investors to look at creating new schemes within the shells of existing buildings in central districts. \nThis, coupled with a drive to secondary locations, is fundamentally changing the risk profile of investment portfolios, moving the dial into uncharted territory. \nOver half (57 per cent) of the investors surveyed for the report expressed concern about being pushed into a drift away from their traditional investment strategies because of this rush into alternative assets. \nRisk is, and always will be, an essential part of any investment. But that must never come at the expense of responsible practice, which is vital to ensuring global stability. \nOf our respondents, 57 per cent said their risk management processes are mainly driven by performance, with only a quarter pointing to compliance. \nThe prevalence of riskier investments, especially, are not the only emerging challenge. \nAutomation of services, the rise in e-commerce and the enormous potential of artificial intelligence are all hugely disruptive trends that the real estate sector is having to grapple with. And investors have had to work hard to build resilience into their decisions. \nIn the face of all this, it’s important the lessons of 10 years ago, and all the improvements since then, are not forgotten. \nMartin J Bruhl FRICS, chair of the RICS Investment Risk Forum and Chief Investment Officer at Union Investment Real Estate SCMP Today: HK Edition Get updates direct to your inbox E-mail * By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy You are signed up.

      "text": "Vietcombank posts 31% profit rise   09:59 | The Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Việt Nam (Vietcombank) has reported VNĐ2.68 trillion (US$119 million) as its pre-tax profit for the third quarter, marking a yearly increase of 31 per cent.— Photo cafef.vn \nHÀ NỘI — The Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Việt Nam (Vietcombank) has reported VNĐ2.68 trillion (US$119 million) as its pre-tax profit for the third quarter, marking a yearly increase of 31 per cent. \nThat helped the largest market-capitalisation bank record a total pre-tax profit of VNĐ7.9 trillion in the nine-month period, an increase of 25 per cent from the previous year’s figure. The bank has now met 86 per cent of the target it set for 2017. \nThe strong increase in Vietcombank’s pre-tax profit was attributed to the healthy growth rates of financial services (24 per cent), core business activities (9 per cent) and other activities (29 per cent). \nThe bank was able to keep its provision for credit losses stable at VNĐ4.5 trillion, nearly unchanged compared to the same period of last year. \nAfter the first three quarters, Vietcombank had total assets of VNĐ898.5 trillion, mobilised capital of VNĐ688 trillion and a lending amount of VNĐ536 trillion. \nThese figures increased by between 14 per cent and 16 per cent on an annual basis. \nThe ratio of bad debts during the nine-month period was 1.15 per cent, down from 1.51 per cent made at the end of last year, thanks to the decline of loans that are classified as sub-standard debts and potentially-irrecoverable debts. \nCredit institution’s loans are divided into five categories of debt in accordance with regulations issued by the State Bank of Việt Nam in 2013. \nIn addition to the two types mentioned above, the other three are standard debts, attention-needed debts and doubtful debts. \nShares of Vietcombank, listed on the HCM Stock Exchange under code VCB, fell 2.2 per cent to close Monday at VNĐ39,900 per share. The bank’s share price has gained a total of 8.7 per cent in the last month. \nReduced cross-ownership in financial units \nVietcombank plans to sell its entire stakes in the HCM City-based Saigon Bank for Industry and Trade (Saigonbank) and Việt Nam Cement Finance Company (CFC) on November 20. \nThe bank obtained approval of the State Securities Commission for its share sales in the two financial units on Friday. The divestment plan was approved by the bank’s management board in late August. \nVietcombank will auction entire 13.2 million shares or 4.3 per cent of total capital in Saigonbank at the starting price of 12,550 per share. \nIt also plans to sell all of its 6.6 million shares, equal to 10.91 per cent stake in CFC, at the starting price of VNĐ11,549 per share. \nThe deals are expected to generate roughly VNĐ242 billion for Vietcombank and help it comply with the SBV’s circular 36 on regulations for the operation of finance-credit institutions in Việt Nam. \nAccording to the combined nine-month financial report of Saigonbank, the southern financial institution posted a pre-tax profit of VNĐ231 billion, a yearly increase of 25 per cent and equal to 85 per cent of its 2017 targeted number. \nHowever, Saigonbank had a higher non-performing loan ratio, which increased to 2.75 per cent from 2.63 per cent at the end of 2016, nearly hitting the limit of 3 per cent set by the SBV. \nFor 2017, Saigonbank plans to record VNĐ270 billion in pre-tax profit – an annual rise of 55 per cent – and a 5 per cent dividend payout rate for shareholders. \nCFC has not released its nine-month financial report. According to the company’s audited six-month financial report, CFC posted VNĐ5 billion in pre-tax profit – down 50 per cent from last year’s number. \nBesides CFC and Saigonbank, Vietcombank also wants to offload its entire 5.07 per cent ownership in Orient Commercial Bank (OCB). \nVietcombank is also holding stakes in two other financial units, which are Việt Nam Export and Import Joint Stock Commercial Bank (Eximbank) (8.19 per cent) and Military Commercial Joint Stock Bank (MBBank) (7.16 per cent). \nAt its annual general shareholder meeting held in April 2017, Vietcombank’s management board proposed shareholders approve its plan to divest from Eximbank with the hope of receiving VNĐ700 billion. \nThe management board also proposed to keep its ownership in MBBank unchanged as the military-owned bank has been operating efficiently and making instant yearly dividend payouts. — VNS",

      "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Financial guarantee insurer, Danajamin Nasional Bhd, and Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd (BPMB) have collaborated to co-guarantee the issuance of an 18-year, RM639 million Senior Sukuk Murabahah (Sukuk) by TRIplc Bhd’s unit, TRIplc Medical Sdn Bhd (TMSB). \nIn a statement today, Danajamin said, the guarantee marked its second guarantee facility extended to the TRIplc group after the previous sukuk issuance for the construction of Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Puncak Alam, Selangor. \n“The funds raised from the issuance of the Sukuk will be used primarily to part-finance the project’s cost of the new teaching hospital and medical academic centre development in UiTM’s existing campus in Puncak Alam,” it said. \nIt said the Sukuk was rated ‘AA1/stable’ by RAM Rating Services Bhd premised on the support from the co-guarantors’ irrevocable and unconditional financial guarantee during the construction period. \n“This means that the guarantee will not be required once the project has been completed,” it said. \nDanajamin Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mohamed Nazri Omar, said the company would continue to be innovative in how it applied its financial guarantee to create rating diversity and at the same time find new ways to bring developmental as well as economic impact to Malaysia. \n“For the past eight years, Danajamin has brought a total of 18 first-time bond/sukuk issuers into the market and has provided its guarantee for bond/sukuk programmes issued by a total of 32 viable Malaysian corporations across various sectors. \n“To-date Danajamin has brought about a market impact of approximately RM16 billion,” he said. \nBPMB’s President/Group CEO, Shaharuddin Zainuddin, said the bank’s participation in this project reflected its continued commitment to provide financing to the four mandated sectors – infrastructure, oil and gas, maritime and technology. \n“We had approved financing totalling RM7.2 billion for 33 private finance initiative projects in the country mainly in infrastructure which include education and healthcare sectors, to-date,” he said. – BERNAMA",

      "text": "Tweet The bad debt ratio in the Vietnamese banking system has been on the decline since the start of this year. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in the Vietnamese banking system has been on the decline since the start of this year, as banks speed up the handling of toxic debts and a new regulation became effective in August to facilitate this thorny process. Bad loans accounted for 2.46% of total credit at the end of August, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the opening session of a National Assembly sitting in Hanoi on Monday. The ratio slid from 2.55% in the first quarter of 2017 and 2.48% in the second quarter, according to central bank statistics. The National Assembly enacted a resolution on August 15 to allow the repossession of mortgage, paving the way for banks and the Vietnam Asset Management Company ( VAMC ) to liquidate their bad debt stockpiles more quickly. The government report added that VAMC had issued 261 trillion dong ($11.5 billion) worth of special bonds to acquire NPLs as of end-July since its establishment in July 2013. Of the amount, the company recouped over 60 trillion dong ($2.64 billion), including 16 trillion dong in the nine months through September. In the first eight months of this year, banks in Vietnam handled as much as 57 trillion dong ($2.5 billion) worth of bad debt. \nA central bank report last week said that total credit in the Vietnamese banking system expanded 12.16% between January and September. Meanwhile, the National Financial Supervisory Commission said in a monthly report earlier this month that banks had put aside 110 trillion dong ($4.84 billion) for provisions of credit risks as of September.

The company owes BNDES 3.3 billion reais ($1 billion).\n\"I cannot even assess what has been presented. Only in Brazil can this (Oi's proposal) be called a plan. I don't think we have a plan,\" Rabello de Castro said at a pulp and paper industry event in Sao Paulo.\nHe said the bank was prepared to take a \"rational economic\" stance to help Oi recover from bankruptcy, but gave no details.\nThe judge overseeing the phone carrier's bankruptcy protection case agreed again to postpone a creditors assembly that was originally scheduled for Monday until Nov. 10, the company said in a securities filing.\nThe judge had already postponed the meeting until Nov. 6.\n\n($1 = 3.2376 reais) (Reporting by Leonardo Goy; Writing by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Peter Cooney and Leslie Adler)",

      "text": "Shia organizations hunger strike enters sixth day By 97 \nSJA Jafri KARACHI: The hunger strike camps continued on the sixth consecutive day in Karachi as well as throughout the country as dozens of prominent Shia and Sunni scholars, political and religious heads and people of different walk of life visited and joined strikers for immediate release of abducted, missing and kidnapped shia people nationwide. \nAccording to Messenger’s surveys thousands of Shia Muslims are gathered at various hunger strike camps arranged by the All Pakistan Shia Action Committee (APSAC), Majlis-e-Wehdatul Muslimeen (MWM) and Shia Ulema Council (SUC) while dozens of Shia Matami Organizations are also participating and supporting hunger strike camps. A large number of youngsters, old age citizens and children including the families of victims and missing persons were found at different hunger strike camps at Incholi, Rizvia, Malir, Sadaat Colony, Abbas Town and many other places of the city where protesters were demanding for immediate release of their loved ones. A movement for the safe recovery of missing Shia persons was announced a couple of weeks ago in Karachi, with leaders and members of the Shia community presenting them for voluntary arrest to force the government to take action on the issue. The ‘Fill the Jail Movement’ has been initiated in protest against the forced disappearances of hundreds of Shia persons, community leaders said. The leaders have vowed to present themselves for arrest every Friday till those missing are safely recovered. The movement, which began after a demonstration against forced disappearances, is expected to spread to other areas of the country. At least 150 Shia persons have been picked up in the country over the course of three years. MWM Deputy Speaker General Hasan Zafar Naqvi had claimed that “picking up young people from their homes and holding them captive by LEAs is a violation of human rights.” Leaders and workers of different Shia parties are participating in the protest in large numbers.

Since its premiere, the acting performance of Song Seung Hun and Go Ah Ra has been actively making this drama on the rise. \nSong Seung Hun and Go Ah Ra for the first time tried a genre like this through the drama ‘Black’. Song Seung Hun that makes women thrill with his sweet charm and Go Ah Ra who is loved for her cheerful character, showing different acting styles. Song Seung Hoon plays a death angel named Black, who borrows the body of Han Moo Kang, while Go Ah Ra plays a woman who can see death named Kang Ha Ram. Image Source : OCN \nSong Seung Hun plays several roles, ranging from mystery to comedy in the process of borrowing the body of detective Han Moo Kang. Han Moo Kang’s character shows that he is not fit to work as a detective, he feels uncomfortable every time he sees a corpse, and it frustrates his colleague Na Kwang Kyun (Kim Won Hae). But then it raises suspicions when Moo Kang is often in trouble, investigating the case alone. After he came back to life, he talks and behaves differently. But it also creates humor because he is not yet familiar with the human world. Black’s attempt to adapt in the human world by borrowing Moo Kang’s body becomes the reason why the drama is awaited. Image Source : OCN \nGo Ah Ra acts as Ha Ram, a woman who feels guilty for not being able to save her father and others from the dead, adding to the excitement of the story. She also tried to hide from the fear of the shadows of death angle with sunglasses, but Moo Kang’s words have encouraged her to save people from death. Share this article",

      "text": "High thyroid hormone levels may up irregular heartbeat risk Tuesday, 24 October 2017 | IANS | New York Individuals with higher levels of thyroid hormone in the blood are more likely to develop irregular heartbeat, suggesting that the levels could help identify individuals at risk for the condition, researchers say. Irregular heartbeat or atrial fibrillation occurs when the two upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, beat irregularly and faster than normal. Symptoms may include heart palpitations, dizziness, sweating, chest pain, anxiety, fatigue during exertion and fainting, and can cause stroke and heart failure, potentially associated with lifelong disability and even death. The findings showed that individuals with higher blood levels of thyroid hormone -- free thyroxine or FT4 -- had 45 per cent increased risk of suffering from irregular heartbeat, compared to people with the lowest levels. Even more modest increases in thyroid hormone were associated with an increased risk, the researchers noted in the journal Circulation. \"Our findings suggest that levels of the thyroid hormone, free thyroxine, circulating in the blood might be an additional risk factor for atrial fibrillation,\" said lead author Christine Baumgartner, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California - San Francisco. \"Free thyroxine hormone levels might help to identify individuals at higher risk,\" Baumgartner added. Elevated FT4 levels may also indicate hyperthyroidism, and other thyroid problems, such as thyroiditis or toxic multinodular goiter. For the study, the team analysed data from 11 studies from Europe, Australia, and the US, including 30,085 individuals, that measured thyroid function and the occurrence of irregular heartbeat. Blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which regulates the production of thyroid hormones and is primarily measured in clinical practice to assess thyroid function, however, were not associated with an increased risk of irregular heartbeat.",

      "text": "Nicholas (Nick) Robone, 28, left, and his brother Anthony (Tony), 25, are seen in this 2017 photo during a trip to Seattle. The brothers grew up close in Las Vegas, where they were the only siblings in the same family and shared a love of hockey and the same alma mater, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Tony grew up to be a firefighter and paramedic and has been credited with saving the life of his brother, who he was with when he was shot in the upper chest on Oct. 1 at a country music festival during the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nick is expected to make a full recovery and be ready to return to work in six to eight weeks. (Emmanuel Banez via AP)\nLAS VEGAS — Nicholas and Anthony Robone are about as close as two brothers can be.\nThey are the only two kids in their family, born and raised in Las Vegas. Nick and Tony share a passion for ice hockey, and as boys used their tape-wrapped hockey sticks to knock a puck around the street.\nTony followed Nick in becoming a defenseman, and joined him as a student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. A year ago, they pooled their money to buy the three-bedroom house they share. ADVERTISEMENT\nSo it wasn’t unusual that they were together at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, striking Nick, 28, in the upper chest and forcing firefighter and paramedic Tony, 25, into the role of his big brother’s rescuer.\nNick was at the country music festival with a three-day pass his parents gave him for his September birthday. “It was going to be a fun night to hang out,” he said.\nTony, with the Henderson County Fire Department, couldn’t join his brother the first two days, but arrived at the festival grounds at about 8:30 p.m. on the final night after attending the Vegas Golden Knights professional hockey game. The brothers were with a few friends in the middle of the main stage area.\nCounty music singer Jason Aldean was just a few songs into his set when the popping sounds started after 10 p.m. and Nick felt a piercing pain in his left side. A bullet had entered his chest right above his heart and lung, and traveled down to his side muscle, missing organs but badly bruising the lung.\nTony treated Nick’s wound as round after round of gunfire rained down on the panicked crowd. In the end, 58 people died. Hundreds were injured in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\nTony told a news conference two days after the shooting that he and their friend Billy Tufano, an emergency medical technician, helped get Nick to the east side of the stage where they hid behind a police car. They later continued farther east, and eventually got Nick into an ambulance.\nCritically injured, Nick was in surgery for four hours, in intensive care at Sunrise Hospital for five days, and released after 10 days.\nThree weeks after the shooting, Nick is home recovering. He gets around pretty well on his own, he said in a telephone interview last week. He’s expected to make a full recovery.\n“There won’t be any real rehab to speak off,” he said. “Just walk around a few times a day,” do some regular breathing exercises and eat a good diet.\nNick has credited quick attention by his brother and friends at the concert for saving his life. Tony “NEVER left my side,” he said in a tweet. ADVERTISEMENT\nDoctors have estimated it will be six to eight weeks before he can return to work, he said.\nNick said he’s received unconditional support from Topgolf, an entertainment property with a driving range and restaurants where he’s employed in marketing. He also is an assistant ice hockey coach at his alma mater, where the Rebels hockey team and its fans have rallied around him.\nWith the #VegasStrong hashtag scrawled on signs throughout the City National Arena, the “Skatin’ Rebels” won their home game 8-0 in Nick’s honor the Friday after the massacre. A few days later, he felt well enough to visit the team and promise, “I’ll be back.”\n“My brother is the toughest guy I know,” Tony said. “And I think the amount of support from the community, from the hockey community, from the firefighter community, it just represents and reflects the kind of guy he is.”\nThe feeling is mutual. “My brother is a really great guy,” Nick said.\nSubscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

However, in many natives' heart, Chongqing owns another trademark: \"a city of bridges\". \nIn 2005, Chongqing was officially recognized as the \"city of bridges\" in China owning to the characteristics of great numbers, large scale, high-level technology, diversification and great influence at the annual conference of Mao Yisheng bridge committee. \nChongqing's special geographical conditions dictate that the bridges are indispensable for urban transportation. The city, which winds by the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, Wujiang and many other tributaries, needs to link the various regions together by bridges. Therefore, more than ten thousand different-sized bridges are built in Chongqing. There are even 29 bridges distributed in the urban area. The construction density and difficulty are rarely seen in the world. \nFor Chongqing, the bridges have played witness to the development of the city. The Jialing River Bridge in Niujiaotuo, which was opened in 1966, is the first river-spanning bridge in Chongqing, with a construction time of eight years. Since Chongqing was ranked as a municipality, the bridge construction speed in urban Chongqing has accelerated. A great number of large-scale bridges like Lijiatuo Yangtze Bridge and Shimen Bridge have been put into use. In the urban area today, it's not unusual to build several river-spanning bridges at the same time.",

See photos \nNational Award winning actor Manoj Bajpayee, who shares screen space with Sidharth Malhotra in the upcoming movie ‘Aiyaary’, says working with the young actor is “great”. \n“Sidharth is a great guy to work with and a great guy to know. We kind of developed some kind of fantastic bond while working for ‘Aiyaary’,” Manoj told IANS over phone from Mumbai. \nTalking about the film, directed by Neeraj Pandey, Manoj described it as a “great script”. \n“It is one of the best scripts I have been a part of. It’s a story based on true events. It’s about military intelligence and the people working for it,” he added. \nThe film, set in Delhi, London and Kashmir, revolves around two strong-minded Army officers having completely different views, yet right in their own ways. It is a real-life story based on the relationship between a mentor and a protege. \nManoj, who is gearing up for the release of his forthcoming film “Rukh”, says he is privileged to be a part of ‘Aiyaari’. “I am really privileged to get ‘Aiyaari’ and the role I have got to play in the film. It is one-of-a-kind,” he added. \nPresented by Plan C and Jayantilal Gada (Pen), the project is produced by Shital Bhatia, Dhaval Jayantilal Gada and Motion Picture Capital. \nThe film, which also features actor Rakul Preet Singh, was due to release on January 26, 2018, but will now hit the screens on February 9, 2018. The other star cast of the film includes Anupam Kher , Kumud Mishra, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub and Nasseruddin Shah.   More Related News",

      "text": "Recalcitrant flasher gets 3 months' jail Published Shaffiq Idris Alkhatib \nSINGAPORE - A recalcitrant flasher was sentenced on Tuesday (Oct 24) to three months' jail for exposing his private parts to a 10-year-old girl while his own daughter was in the vicinity. \nIT manager Tang Chee Leong, 44, who pleaded guilty to insulting the victim's modesty, has been in and out of jail since 2001 for offences including molestation and performing obscene acts in public. \nThe father of two young daughters was last sentenced to three weeks' jail in 2015 after exposing himself to a teenage girl, but reoffended about a year later. \nBefore handing out the sentence, District Judge Kenneth Yap said that Tang was a menace to the public and that he was lucky his current offence did not qualify him for corrective training. \nCorrective training is a prison regime for repeat offenders, lasting five to 14 years without time off for good behaviour. \nUrging Tang to seek treatment, the judge added: \"There is clearly something wrong with you... It's perverted behaviour.\" \nThe 10-year-old girl had gone to a Toa Payoh Central restaurant with her mother and younger brother on Dec 2 last year when she had to use the restroom. \nThe restaurant's toilet has male and female cubicles situated side by side, with a common area outside. \nDeputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling said Tang was also having a meal with one of his daughters in the same eatery at the time. \nAt around 3.30pm, the victim was in a toilet cubicle by herself when she heard a few knocks on the door. She then heard Tang asking her for some toilet paper. \nDPP Chee said: \"The victim took a few pieces of toilet paper and passed them to the accused through the gap under the door. The accused then requested that the victim open the door to pass him the toilet paper and she complied.\" \nThe girl then saw Tang standing outside with his trousers around his knees and his private parts exposed. \nShe passed him the toilet paper and closed the door after he walked away. \nShaken by what she had seen, she quickly left the toilet and told her mother about her ordeal. The 40-year-old woman alerted the police. \nThe victim's brother checked the male cubicle and noted that it had not run out of toilet paper, the court heard. \nDPP Chee asked the court to jail Tang for at least three months, stressing that the girl was severely affected after the incident. \nThe prosecutor added: \"She did not dare go back to the restaurant or go to any public toilet by herself.\" \nDPP Chee also said that according to the Institute of Mental Health, Tang has obsessive-compulsive disorder but this condition did not contribute to his current offence. \nDefence lawyer S.S. Dhillon pleaded for two months' jail and said that his client had no explanation for his behaviour. \nTang will surrender himself at the State Courts on Nov 7 to begin his sentence. \nFor insulting the girl's modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined.

      "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Benevento have fired coach Marco Baroni after becoming the first team in Serie A history to lose their first nine matches of the season. \nThe club announced that 54-year-old Baroni, who led them out of Serie B last season and into the top flight for the first time, would be replaced by Roberto De Zerbi. \n\"The club thanks Baroni for his professionalism and the great emotions that he brought to Benevento football club, the fans and the city, with promotion to Serie A,\" the club said in a statement.\nBenevento set their unwanted record by losing 3-0 at home to Fiorentina on Sunday. They have scored only two goals in their nine games and conceded 22. \nDe Zerbi, 38, had two seasons in charge of Foggia, narrowly missing out on promotion. His only previous experience of coaching in Serie A was a three-month spell at Palermo last season. \nBenevento are the second club this season to change coach after Cagliari - who they visit in their next league match on Wednesday.\n\n(Reporting by Brian Homewood; editing by Sudipto Ganguly)\n(This story has not been edited by economictimes.com and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.) 0 Comments",

After being escorted round the airport pursued by a huge pack of journalists, the suspects appeared to get tired and were placed in wheelchairs. Huong and Aisyah, in their 20s, are accused of killing Kim on February 13 by rubbing the nerve agent VX on his face in a Cold War-style hit that stunned the world. The women, who were arrested a few days after the assassination and face death by hanging if convicted, have pleaded not guilty to murdering the estranged half-brother of Kim Jong-Un. At the airport, the women were first taken to the check-in area where they allegedly smeared the deadly nerve agent in Kim's face. He died an agonising death within 20 minutes of the attack with a chemical so deadly it is classified as a weapon of mass destruction. The suspects were then taken to a cafe called Bibik Heritage, where Aisyah met a man identified in court as \"Mr Chang\" who allegedly wiped a liquid on her hands before she carried out the attack. The group headed to the clinic where Kim was taken after the attack and then to a taxi stand, where the women went after the alleged murder. The women are accused on the charge sheet of committing the murder with four other suspects, who are still at large. Four North Koreans fled Malaysia on the day of the murder. The assassination sparked a fierce row between Malaysia and North Korea, which is suspected of ordering the hit. Pyongyang denies the allegation. (AFP) (WAH)",

      "text": "Tuesday, 24 Oct 2017 1:00 PM MYT \nSYDNEY: A group of men seen swimming inside a baited crocodile trap in Australia near where a woman was recently eaten were blasted as “idiots of the century” Tuesday. \nPhotos posted on Facebook showed the four men clambering on the floating trap set near a marina at Port Douglas in northern Queensland state and even posing inside it. \nIt is not far from where a 4.3-metre (14-foot) croc killed dementia sufferer Anne Cameron. \nThe beast that took the 79-year-old less than two weeks ago was trapped and human remains found inside, but plenty of other crocodiles inhabit the rivers and seas in the area. \nDouglas Shire Mayor Julia Leu said she was stunned at their stupidity. \n“I was absolutely gobsmacked, this is incredibly stupid and dangerous behaviour,” she said told broadcaster ABC. \n“I’m wondering if these fellows are vying for the idiots of the year award or the idiots of the century award.” \nQueensland Environment Minister Steven Miles also weighed in, tweeting: “Srsly? The meat we put in these traps is bait. For crocodiles. Don’t swim in them! It’s stupid, and illegal.” \nSaltwater crocodiles, which can grow up to seven metres long and weigh more than a tonne, are a common feature of Australia’s tropical north and kill an average of two people a year. \nTheir numbers have exploded since they were declared a protected species in the 1970s, with Cameron’s death reigniting calls to control them. \nQueensland’s environment department said the men’s actions were “reckless”. \n“These traps are specifically designed to attract crocodiles and they are deployed in places where a problem crocodile is known to be present,” it said in a statement. \n“It is not an exaggeration to say that interfering with crocodile traps can be potentially life-threatening for the person concerned.” \nThere are fines of up to Aus$15,000 (US$11,700) for interfering with a crocodile trap. -AFP Tags / Keywords:",

In a FB post after receiving the report of the Hardware Mission headed by Jayasankar Prasad here on Monday, the Chief Minister said the Mission had submitted its report indicating Kerala’s potential to leverage its strengths in human resources, promotion of the State’s startup ecosystem and the need for a proactive policy to establish a manufacturing hub in electronics and related hardware. Mr. Vijayan said the possibility of a power electronics cluster in the State was being explored. An MoU with Intel and UST Global for exploring the potential for establishing PC and Server manufacturing in the State was on the anvil. Once feasibility was established, a joint venture involving the government and the private players would be established.",

      "text": "Tags : solange knowles beyonce Singer Solange Knowles has received a formal apology from editors at British newspaper Evening Standard for removing her braided crown from the ES Magazine cover she posed for. Beyonce's younger sister donned an elaborate gold braid shaped into a circular crown for the shoot, but the gorgeous hairstyle was removed by retouchers from the publication's cover. The ill-advised removal of the singer's hairdo from the front of the magazine caused offence, prompting the star to share a photo featuring her full hairstyle for the shoot on her personal Instagram account on Thursday (19Oct17). \"dtmh @eveningstandardmagazine,\" Solange wrote in the image caption, referring to her hit song Don't Touch My Hair from her critically acclaimed album A Seat at the Table. During her interview with the Evening Standard, Knowles described the art of braiding as \"act of beauty, an act of convenience and an act of tradition\" in African-American culture, and a practice that is deeply important to her, and editors issued a statement on Saturday (21Oct17) formally apologising for their editorial affront. \"We were delighted to have the chance to interview the wonderful Solange Knowles and photograph her for this week’s edition of ES magazine,\" the apology reads. \"It is therefore a matter of great regret that the finished cover artwork of the magazine caused concern and offence. \"The decision to amend the photograph was taken for layout purposes but plainly we made the wrong call and we have offered our unreserved apologies to Solange.\" In her accompanying interview for the shoot, Knowles, 31, also explained why taking ownership of her physical appearance has been a deeply important pursuit for her throughout 2017. \"To be honest, owning my body this year was really important to me,\" she said. \"That can mean a lot of things. That can be in physical form - wanting to have control over my physical body - and also wanting to have control in the way it is presented to the world. \"And it isn’t always easy. I often lose opportunities based on my will to want to navigate through that ownership of my body in the most authentic way.\" Discography",

      "text": "October 23, 2017 Grace Poe on New TNVS Guidelines Question: What can you say about the LTFRB's promise during the hearing to finish its revised TNVS guidelines by September? I have previously received the letter from the LTFRB explaining their delay in releasing the revised TNVS guidelines and thank them for updating our office. I understand that given the numerous issues involved, which only came to light during the technical working group (TWG) discussions, it might be irresponsible on the part of the LTRFB to release new guidelines without taking into account the new issues that have surfaced. Even during the TWGs conducted by my own committee, it appears that the problems were not limited to simply the number of vehicles on the road or that of surge pricing. Issues on fleet service, company markings on vehicles, and even insurance, among others, also need to be addressed. Nonetheless, I strongly urge the LTFRB to complete the revised guidelines at the soonest possible time after it has failed to meet its self-imposed deadline. In the interest of public service, the LTFRB should release the guidelines before the end of the year, preferably before the holiday rush. To delay the release of those guidelines will affect, not just the daily commute of those who rely on TNVS, but also those who rely on it for a living. News",

The top leadership has approved four pilot national parks in the Sanjiangyuan region (the source of three rivers - the Yangtze, the Yellow and the Lancang) and Qilian Mountain. The area in total covers 215,000 square kilometers, said Yang Weimin, deputy head of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economic Affairs, the country's top economic policy-making office at a news conference on Monday afternoon. \"It means 2 percent of national territory will be saved for the rare species and to keep it clean for future generations, an unprecedented effort in history,\" he added at the news conference on the sidelines of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China when introducing the achievements in ecological civilization. Yang said in the past there were many departments to manage a vast number of natural reserves, but in many cases management methods could be enhanced. Source: china daily",

      "text": "--> Amit Bhatt  20 AM IST, DNA But in a miracle of a sort, doctors at a hospital in the state capital Jaipur successfully took out the screw without any open surgery \nDula Ram and his wife Sharda Devi, a couple from Singhi Bas Village in Deedwana were panic-stricken after their one-year-old son Devesh swallowed a three-inch long screw while playing with it. When Dula Ram took the little one to doctors in Deedwana and Jaipur, they suggested him an open surgery as the only option to take the screw out.\nBut in a miracle of a sort, doctors at a hospital in the state capital Jaipur successfully took out the screw without any open surgery. Importantly, the child did not have to stay in the hospital, the process did not involve any blood loss and the expenditure for the entire process cost the family only Rs3.5 thousand.\n“We took him to doctor in Deedwana and he said that it could be taken out by open surgery only. Expense for the surgery was estimated around Rs50,000, which was difficult for me to afford,” Dula Ram told DNA.\n“It was very risky, during the investigation we found that the screw was slightly bigger,” said Dr Saket Agrawal, Gastroenterologist at Narayana Hospital. “ The screw was trapped in the small intestine, at the junction slightly above the small intestine and large intestine. It could tear the intestine, leading to intestinal bleeding, which could be proved life-threatening for the kid. For this reason it was almost impossible to take it out without open surgery. But we decided to go for endoscopic technique,” Dr Saket added.\nThe team of doctors, with the help of telescope, angulate the screw carefully and after a two and half hour long process, successfully took out the screw from the kid’s intestine. “Holding the screw was a great challenge as it was stuck at Ileocecal Valve (a sphincter muscle valve that separates the small intestine and the large intestine). It has a high risk of internal bleeding involved as any effort to push or pull the screw could damage the inner layer of intestine,” said Dr Saket.\nDevesh is completely healthy after the operation and was discharged within two hours.\nAmit Bhatt",

Dr Priya Marwah, a bone marrow transplant surgeon, has been fighting to lead a normal life since 49 years she contracted polio.\n“It was a day after my first birthday, I had some viral fever. The doctor initially thought I had blood cancer and later he said it can be a malaria. They gave me two intramuscular injections and by third my mother refused to get me treated for the same because my situation was getting worse. That time I contracted polio,” shared Marwah.\nMarawah couldn’t get up from her bed for a few years after she got polio. “I started going to school at the age of 6. However, being good at studies, I was promoted to senior classes and by the time I completed 10th standard I was of same age as the other people of my class,” she said. \nThe life wasn’t simple for Marwah at school even though she has been a bright student. “There were times I was let down because of my disability. Kids threw stone on me on the street. \nIn school despite being good at studies and even holding positions for two consecutive years, my teachers didn’t made me school president because of my disability,” she added. \n“That was a turning point in my life.
