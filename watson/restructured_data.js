    text: 'Email Text Drews Finishes First Season with USA Annie Drews was a standout contributor in her first season with USA Oct. 3,   The end of summer marks the conclusion of USA Volleyball\'s season and the end of perhaps the most exciting chapter in Annie Drews\' volleyball career. Following her MVP season in which she led Caquas Criollas to the Puerto Rican title, she received an invite to train with Team USA and did not disappoint from the moment she arrived in Anaheim, California. Over the course of three tournament appearances and a pair of friendly competitions against Brazil, Drews proved to be one of the top offensive options for the Americans. Beginning with the Pan American Cup in June, Drews led Team USA to its 16th Pan Am Cup in Canete, Peru. The Americans won all seven of their matches defeating Venezuela, Columbia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The Elkhart, Indiana, native hit .370 with 54 kills on 108 swings to lead the United States in hitting percentage and finish tied for the second most kills on the team. After her dominant effort in the Pan Am Cup, she was left off the Grand Prix roster to begin the tournament, allowing her to go back to Anaheim, California, and train in the Team USA system. However, in need of more offense, Team USA added Drews to the FIVB World Grand Prix Final Six roster and she delivered. Despite USA falling in both of its matches in the final six, Drews led the Americans with 25 kills on 65 attempts in six sets of action. Of USA\'s top three point scorers in the finals, Drews was the only player to come off the bench. She appeared in six of a possible nine sets and registered the second most points on the team with 26 to her credit. Following her two tournaments abroad, she finally sported the red, white and blue in her home country as Team USA hosted Brazil in the USA Volleyball Cup. In front of family, friends and Team USA fanatics, Drews posted two of her best efforts in a USA uniform. In back-to-back contests, the right side hitter torched Brazil for 36 points in just six sets of action. USA defeated Brazil in its first match in three sets and chose to play a bonus set, allowing Drews to rack up 21 points with 14 kills, three blocks and an ace coming in the official three sets. The lefty came off the bench in the second match to lead the United States with 12 kills on 21 attempts with just three errors along with three blocks and an ace in just two sets of action. Drews finished her rookie season with USA in the FIVB World Grand Champions Cup in which she helped the Americans to a bronze medal with wins over Korea, Russia and the tournament\'s host, Japan. She finished with the second most points on USA\'s roster, eighth most points in the tournament and just one point shy of her teammate Jordan Larson who took home the Best Spiker Award as part of the tournament\'s Dream Team. Drews posted 69 points with 58 kills, nine blocks and two aces over the course of five matches. Altogether, Purdue\'s all-american alumna appeared in 55 sets for the United States and terminated 164 of her 381 attempts with 57 errors giving her a .281 hitting percentage and a 2.98 kills per set average. She complemented her scoring efforts with 23 blocks and six aces as well. While enjoying her success with Team USA, Drews signed with SASB Volleyball Legano in Italy\'s Serie A2 to continue her professional volleyball career and prepare for her next season with Team USA.',

Turkish man accused of causing a flight disturbance the prompted fighter jets to escort the plane to its Honolulu destination is scheduled to plead guilty Tuesday, Oct. 3. Hawaii News Now via AP, File) Man in flight disturbance case was hallucinating butterfly By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER Associated Press October 03, 2017 9:02 PM HONOLULU \nA Turkish man pleaded guilty Tuesday to interfering with a flight crew and blamed his inflight behavior that prompted fighter jets to escort the plane to its Honolulu destination on hallucinating that he was chasing a butterfly. \nA butterfly suddenly came out of the front pocket of the seat in front of him, Anil Uskanli said in a Honolulu federal court Tuesday in describing what he did during the May 19 American Airlines flight from Los Angeles. "The butterfly went crazy ... flew into the toilet," he said. "I followed it. I tried to kill it by punching it." \nUskanli, 25, said he now realizes that he was ill and hallucinating. \nTo flight crew and passengers, Uskanli\'s behavior was concerning, including when he walked to the front of the plane with a blanket wrapped around his head and carrying a laptop crew members feared contained explosives, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Brady said. \nAfter Uskanli returned to his seat and with an off-duty officer sitting with him, the laptop remained on a drink cart, which prompted the captain to initiate bomb-threat procedures, Brady said. \nThe Hawaii National Guard scrambled two fighter jets to escort the plane to Honolulu. The secretary of Homeland Security was briefed. \nUskanli raised other red flags while still at Los Angeles International Airport, but experts said a lack of communication and an airline\'s hesitancy to be caught on video booting a passenger played a role in allowing him to fly. In April, a United Airlines incident in which a passenger was dragged off an overcrowded plane drew widespread attention. \nUskanli had purchased a ticket at an airline counter in the middle of the night with no luggage and was arrested ahead of the flight to Hawaii after opening a door to a restricted airfield. Airport police said he smelled of alcohol but was not intoxicated enough to be charged with public drunkenness, so he was given a citation and released. \nAfter the flight landed in Honolulu and Uskanli was arrested, a judge ordered a mental competency evaluation at the request of his defense attorney. He was sent to a federal detention facility in Los Angeles to undergo the evaluation. \nWhen Uskanli returned to Honolulu, defense attorney Richard Sing tried to have a hearing on his mental competency and detention closed to the public. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kenneth Mansfield initially granted the request. The Associated Press, Honolulu Star-Advertiser and other media objected, urging the judge not to limit the public\'s right to court access without following proper procedures. \nAt a hearing last month, when lawyers representing the media were prepared to argue against closing the courtroom, Sing withdrew the motion, saying his concerns could be addressed without closing the entire proceeding. That allowed the hearing to move forward in open court. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Morgan Early argued that he should be held without bail because he\'s a danger to the community and suffers from a "major mental illness." Mansfield ruled that he was competent for trial and must be held without bail. \nTuesday\'s hearing was delayed by about two hours because Engin Turkalp, a Turkish interpreter, was late. When the hearing finally got under way, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson abruptly left the bench and seemed frustrated over the Turkalp\'s apparent inability to effectively translate the proceeding. \nWhen Watson returned to the courtroom, he continued with the proceeding without using the interpreter and told Uskanli to use her if necessary. The lawyers in the case had requested the interpreter as a precaution even though Uskanli reads and understands English. \nUsklani\'s student visa had been revoked because he wasn\'t attending school, his immigration attorney Gary Singh said Tuesday. Uskanli faces deportation proceedings, but he plans to return to Turkey on his own, Singh said: "He just wants to go home. He\'s sick and wants to go home to get help." \nHe faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. But prosecutors don\'t expect to ask for more incarceration than what Uskanli has already served. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access.',

    text: 'The Lawyers’ Committee filed an Amicus Brief in the Landmark Redistricting Case.\nWASHINGTON - Today, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, delivered remarks at the Rally to End Partisan Gerrymandering in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, during oral arguments in Gill v. Whitford. The Lawyers’ Committee filed an amicus curiae or “friend of the court” brief in this complicated case challenging the 2011 Wisconsin State Assembly redistricting plan, which brings to the forefront important questions regarding electoral map making and the ability of voters to have an influence in their representation. In Wisconsin, the redistricting map was struck down by a three-judge federal court panel for imposing “burdens on the representational rights of Democratic voters” in gerrymandered districts. While the Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional, it has not provided clear guidance regarding partisan gerrymandering.\nClarke, who attended today’s hearing, made the following statement:\n“While some of the Justices expressed concern about the floodgates of litigation opening, other Justices were focused on the measurable threat presented by gerrymandering and its impact on the integrity of American democracy. It is time for the Court to act now and rule unequivocally that cases of extreme partisan gerrymandering are subject to judicial review. Gill v. Whitford is a clear example of an electoral map drawn by one party in control of its state legislature in a way that maximizes its partisan advantage. The extreme partisanship at issue in Gill v. Whitford presents strong facts for the Court to provide rules that can help guide the efforts of lawmakers. This case is particularly important as a ruling may provide needed clarity for lawmakers as they prepare for the 2020 redistricting cycle.”\nIn considering a remedy to address partisan gerrymandering, the Lawyers’ Committee filed an amicus brief. The brief, filed with the Georgia State Conference of the NAACP, highlights a racial and partisan gerrymandering case filed by the Lawyers’ Committee this year in Georgia. In that case, plaintiffs claim that the redrawing of lines for Georgia House of Representatives Districts 105 and 111, in 2015, was done with a racially discriminatory purpose to favor the election of white incumbents. In considering a remedy for partisan gerrymandering, the Lawyers’ Committee brief urges the Supreme Court to adopt a standard applicable to partisan gerrymandering sufficiently flexible so as to apply to cases like the Georgia case.\nClick here to read the Gill v. Whitford amicus brief filed in the United States Supreme Court by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n### The Lawyers\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, was formed in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy to involve the private bar in providing legal services to address racial discrimination. The principal mission of the Lawyers\' Committee is to secure, through the rule of law, equal justice under law.\nOrganization Links Lawyers\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law LCCRUL (Press Center)',

    text: 'Via StockBoardAsset.com,\n\nThe story starts with Cody Wilson, an American crypto-anarchist, free market anarchist, and gun-right activist. He is the founder of Defense Distributed, a non-profit organization that develops and publishes open source gun designs.\n\n*The about section on Defense Distributed describes the company as an ‘anti-monopolist digital publishing’. *\n\nBack in 2013, Defense Distributed gained international attention after it published the world’s first fully 3D-printed gun called the Liberator. Almost immediately, the Statement Department under the Obama administration demanded Mr. Wilson takedown the 3D-printable gun files for possible export control violations. In the first two days, downloads for the 3D-printable gun exceeded 100,000.\n\nWilson argued that he’s legally protected, and says Defense Distributed “is excluded from the ITAR regulations under an exemption for non-profit public domain releases of technical files designed to create a safe harbor for research and other public interest activities”.\n\nMr. Wilson eventually had to remove the Liberator files from the internet, due to State Department pressure.\n\nJumping to 2014, Mr. Wilson received the title as ‘Ghost Gunner’ and was described as a gun manufacture by some for creating AR-15 frames without serial numbers. Defense Distributed offered the internet a package including a CNC milling machine that can turn an aluminum block into an AR-15 lower receiver, the components regulated by state and federal authorities. The machine called ‘Ghost Gunner 2’ (3D-printer) and 80% AR-15 lower receivers are still being sold on Defense Distributed’s website.\n\nUnder the *Gun* Control Act of 1968, it is *illegal* for an unlicensed person to *make* a firearm for sale or distribution. But in Defense Distributed case producing blueprints or just manufacturing 80% of the component is perfectly legal. \n\nIn 2015, Fedex and UPS refused to ship a digital CNC milling machine out of Defense Disturbed. Fedex spokesman told WIRED, “this device is capable of manufacturing firearms, and potentially by private individuals. We are uncertain at this time whether this device is a regulated commodity by local, state or federal governments. As such, to ensure we comply with the applicable law and regulations”.\n\nThe Spectre of homemade firearms prompted California in 2016 to ban ‘Ghost Guns’ but there is no law on the federal level prohibiting anyone from downloading gun blueprints.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Wilson’s group announced a new software for his computer-controlled milling machine to carve out the aluminum frame of an M1911 handgun. According to WIRED, “the latest model of the milling machine can finish a handgun’s frame in about an hour, with minimal human interaction”.\n\nIn a pistol, the frame is the only regulated part and anything else can be purchased online without questions. Defense Distributed has decentralized the entire process of assembling a workable weapon without identification, background check, and serial tracking number. Let’s assume the State Department has read this article and is now in a full blown panic.\n\nAnyone in America now has the ability to own a handgun thanks to Defense Distributed. Highlighted above, California is the only state that has outlawed ‘Ghost Guns’ and it shows how the federal government and even state governments are failing to keep up with technological advances.\n\nPer WIRED,\n\n\n\n*“The ghost gun threat is real and growing,”* says Kevin De Leon, the California state senator who introduced the statewide ghost gun ban.\n\n\n*“Are they being made by gang members? Are they being manufactured to sell to individuals who are prohibited from possessing firearms? Technologies that make it possible for the general public to manufacture guns raise serious questions.”*\n\n\n\nMr. Wilson’s passion to let every American build an industrial quality gun at home is nothing new. Gun part vendors have been selling 80 precent frames and unfinished parts for quite some time.\n\n*But its the method of creation through 3D-printers, which has the United States government in a panic.*\n\nGun control talk will once again become a national subject with Class 3 weapons in focus following today’s tragic mass shooting in Las Vegas . Reports of 58 deaths and 515 injured marks the worst mass shooting in US history .',

    text: '(3rd LD) Mattis: Pentagon \'supports fully\' diplomatic solution to N. Korea\n(ATTN: UPDATES with Dunford\'s remarks)\nWASHINGTON, Oct. 3 (Yonhap) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Tuesday that the Pentagon "supports fully" a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear standoff amid mixed messages from Washington.\nPresident Donald Trump signaled over the weekend that he is not interested in negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\nHe said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is "wasting his time" trying to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, after the diplomat acknowledged there was direct communication between the sides.\nThis AP file photo shows U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. (Yonhap)\n"The Defense Department supports fully Secretary Tillerson\'s efforts to find a diplomatic solution, but remains focused on defense of the United States and our allies," Mattis told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.\nHe added that Trump\'s guidance to both Tillerson and himself has been "very clearly" to pursue the diplomatic effort.\n"I do not see the divergence as strongly as some have interpreted it," Mattis said, recalling that Tillerson had said the U.S. is "probing" for opportunities for dialogue with the North, not looking to talk immediately.\nTensions have escalated amid a war of words between Trump and the Kim regime over Pyongyang\'s pursuit of a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.\nTrump has said the U.S. may have no choice but to "totally destroy" North Korea if it is forced to defend itself or its allies. Pyongyang has responded with threats to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean and shoot down American bombers even in international air space.\nMattis argued Trump demonstrated his intent to work diplomatically with other nations on the North Korea issue by dispatching Tillerson to China last week.\nHe also underscored the international community\'s efforts to address the North Korean threat, including through two unanimous U.N. Security Council resolutions since August.\nThose sanctions were adopted in response to North Korea\'s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July and sixth nuclear test in September.\nSeparately, the Trump administration has stepped up unilateral financial sanctions on Pyongyang.\nBut the recalcitrance of Kim\'s regime may call for still tougher sanctions, said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n"If there was one area that has been identified by many people as maybe being the one that would most profoundly change his behavior, it would be the loss of oil," Marine Gen. Joe Dunford said at the same hearing. "We\'ve seen in the past, when he\'s had a cut -- when the oil has been cut off, there\'s been a change in Kim Jong-un\'s behavior."\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters Monday that "now is not the time to talk."\nThe only conversations Washington will have with Pyongyang will be about the release of three Americans currently detained in the North, she said.\nhague@yna.co.kr\n(END)',

    text: 'Apple Valley man arrested after attacking elderly couple during robbery Friday Tuesday Oct 3, 2017 at 5:45 PM Oct 3, 2017 at 5:45 PM Staff Reports \nAPPLE VALLEY — Authorities arrested a 46-year-old man accused of breaking into a home and attacking an elderly couple early Friday. \nAlbert Jermaine Johnson, of Apple Valley, was arrested following the incident, which occurred at a home in the 21000 block of Highway 18 Friday morning. \nSan Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials stated Tuesday that deputies were first dispatched to the home at 12:28 a.m. after receiving reports of a residential robbery in progress. \n“The adult male victim was awakened by the sound of breaking glass and when he got up to see where the noise was coming from he saw a black male, later identified as Albert Johnson, walking past the broken window,” sheriff’s officials said. \nJohnson allegedly attacked the couple after the victim told his wife to call 911, causing “significant injury” to both. Officials said he stopped the attack and then barricaded himself in a bedroom when he saw lights from a deputy’s patrol car. \n“Deputies entered the residence and forced entry into the bedroom where the suspect was hiding,” officials said. “After a brief struggle, the suspect was arrested without further incident.” \nThe victims were able to flee before the standoff, officials said, and were taken to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary for treatment of their injuries. Further updates on their condition weren’t available Tuesday. \nJohnson was arrested on suspicion of robbery, false imprisonment, and causing harm or death to an elder or dependent adult. He appeared in court Tuesday, where prosecutors charged him with second-degree robbery, with additional enhancements for using a deadly weapon and causing a grave bodily injury. \nJohnson plead not guilty to the charge Tuesday, as well as denying all enhancements, court records show. Prosecutors also set his bail at $400,000. Johnson remains in custody at the West Valley Detention Center. About Us',

    text: 'Orange County News ‘I felt very helpless,’ veteran Riverside officer says after witnessing Las Vegas shooting   Shea and Jennifer McMahon, of Riverside, pose at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas. They later had to run for their lives as Stephen Paddock fired on the crowd from the Mandalay Bay hotel on Oct. 1, 2017. (Courtesy of Shea McMahon) By Brian Rokos | brokos@scng.com | The Press-Enterprise October 3, 2017 at 7:01 pm Shea McMahon, a Riverside police officer, usually runs to danger while others scramble in the opposite direction.\nBut the massacre in Las Vegas during the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Sunday, Oct. 1, was anything but usual.\nSo McMahon, 41, who attended the concert with his wife, Jennifer, 39, and brother-in-law and sister-in-law, made sure they all ran for cover as he watched shooting victims drop around them. None of the four was among the more than 500 injured or killed.\n“I felt very helpless,” McMahon, a 16-year veteran of law enforcement, said Tuesday, Oct. 3, as he returned to patrol. McMahon said he thought talking about his ordeal would make him feel better and that climbing back into his familiar black-and-white would make him feel comfortable.\n“Normally, you’re in this job, and something happens, and you have the tools to fight back. Not knowing where the actual shooting was coming from, there was nothing I could fight back with,” said McMahon, who repeated the word “helpless” several times in the interview.\n“Maybe if I was there by myself, or with my buddies, it might have been different,” he said.\nInstead, his first instinct after hearing automatic gunfire was to throw himself on top of his wife after she went to the ground to protect herself. McMahon’s brother-in-law, a Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, did the same to shield his wife.\nAll four are country music fans and regularly attend the Stagecoach Festival in Indio and other concerts. Over the weekend, the couples were celebrating their wedding anniversaries.\nThey had places about 25 yards from the stage where Jason Aldean was performing when the shooting began.\nMcMahon didn’t cover his wife for long after the women in front of them and behind them had been shot.\n“I said ‘Somebody is shooting. We have to get out of here.’ If we were on the ground, we were sitting ducks,” McMahon said. “Seeing people getting shot in the leg and the back and the head, I was preparing to be shot like them.”\nAs they ran toward the exit, others continued to fall beside them. Some were trampled.\n“The noise was just deafening,” he said. “It felt like he was in the venue, chasing us down. It felt like we were being hunted.”\nThey ran to an apartment complex, where someone ushered them into a room. The couples called their families. The McMahons thought about their son, who turned 14 on Monday, and their daughter, 11.\nJennifer then   back of Shea’s shirt was stained with someone else’s dried blood.\n“We’re lucky to be alive,” Shea McMahon said. “It’s a miracle; the grace of God.”',

But Rooster Rabbit (Mike Eaton) was already out and wheeling and sidled Beautiful Lady by the five-eighths. From that point on, Rooster Rabbit matched strides with Beautiful Lady while the rest of the field was stacking up in two rows. \nWhen they hit the three-quarters in 1:24.2 Cherokee Hiflyzane was last and had just pulled to the second tier. But when that outer flow went stagnant, Stevenson tipped Cherokee Hiflyzane four-wide around the final bend and had him rolling with a full head of steam. As the race went down the stretch, Cherokee Hiflyzane was picking off the horses in front of him one by one and eventually got to Beautiful Lady and bested her as well to win by a half-length in 1:52.4. \nIt was the fifth win of the year for Cherokee Hiflyzane ($129.60) and his first since June 19. The $2 exacta of 3-8 with post time favorite Beautiful Lady returned $535.60 and the $2 trifecta of 3-8-5 returned an instant jackpot of $5,233.80. \nCherokee Hiflyzane is owned by Roger Farrar II and Barrie Farrar, who also does the training. \nThe most impressive mile of the day was the effort put in by Sailor Jerry (Nick Graffam) in an $8,500 conditioned event, who with the exception of about ten strides at the quarter, led gate to wire in 1:51.2 pulling away to a four-length victory in a :27.4 last quarter. \nIt was the sixth win of the year for Sailor Jerry ($4.40) who is owned by Christopher Hamilton, Sylvia Hamilton and Mike Graffam, who also trains the winner. \nNick Graffam had a big day, winning three races on the afternoon while Shawn Gray and Mike Stevenson each won two. Mike Graffam had a training double as well. \nRacing resumes at Plainridge Park on Thursday (Oct. 5) with post time at 2:30 p.m. By Tim Bojarski, for the Standardbred Owners of Massachusetts',

Hundreds of concertgoers had fled the scene, running toward the tent where Heather Gooze tended bar in a VIP fan section and seeking shelter from the incoming fire. "You could hear everyone shouting, \'Shooter, shooter,\'" Gooze told ABC News. "This was legitimate terror. "There was a moment where you\'re like, \'I don\'t know what to do.\' And then you\'re like, \'All right, go,\'" she said of her own fight-or-flight reaction. When a second large wave of people rushed the tent, Gooze said, many of them were covered in blood, including Jordan McIldoon, who had been shot in the stomach. Las Vegas shooting: Navy war veteran, Special ed teacher, nurse who shielded wife among those killed Gooze, 43, said she helped carry the 23-year-old man, using a maintenance ladder as a makeshift gurney. "I put my hand on the arm of the guy that was laying there,” the Las Vegas resident said of McIldoon. “We brought him over to the sidewalk and we lay him down.” When she reached down to grab McIldoon\'s hand, she said, it was too late. "The fingers kind of squeezed then just stopped. Like you don\'t have to be a doctor to know," she said of his death. The young man\'s girlfriend, from whom he had been separated during the panic at the concert, called his cellphone, which Gooze answered. "I promised his girlfriend that I would not leave him,” Goozen said. “That I would make sure that she knew where he was going to be going to. What was going to happen. That they knew who he was.” "She said, ‘Is he hurt?’ And I said, \'Yes.\' She said, \'Be honest with me, tell me, is he OK?\' And I said, \'No.\' I said, \'He\'s passed away; he\'s dead.\'" Gooze contacted McIldoon\'s family over the ensuing few hours, including his mother to his grandmother. "I kept thinking about, \'If this was me would people stay with me? Would they make sure I was OK? Would they contact my family? I couldn\'t go," she said. Reblog',

    text: 'Wisconsin was the first to offer Rivals100 offensive tackle Logan Brown of East Kentwood (Mich.) and the class of 2019 prospect has made several visits to Madison since. This past weekend he planned to get his mother up to see the campus, but had to alter those plans.\nRELATED: Film analysis of East Kentwood four-star 2019 DT Mazi Smith\nTHE LATEST\nBrown is headed to Michigan this weekend to see the Wolverines host Michigan State. He finalized those plans on Monday with his recruiting contact in Ann Arbor, Chris Bryant . Other programs he would like to attend games at this season include Iowa , Michigan State , Penn State and Pittsburgh . The 11 a.m. CT kickoff for this past Saturday’s Wisconsin-Northwestern game in Madison was not particularly conducive to Brown’s own schedule, after playing a game on Friday night. The Badgers have four more home games, though, in which to reschedule.\nIN HIS WORDS\n“We weren’t going to end up getting there until kickoff and this whole trip was about getting my mom up there to meet the staff, the people and the players, so I said we’ll catch another game another time. I know I will be up there once or twice (this season) for sure, there’s no doubt about it, whenever my mom’s schedule (allows) because I have seen it and I want her to see it and see why I like it.”\nRIVALS’ REACTION\nWisconsin certainly would like to get Brown on campus as many times as possible, but this postponement should not be taken as a negative so long as they are able to reschedule when his mother can spend more time on campus. The four-star lineman has already seen several Wisconsin home games, so another one is not going to generate a lot more bounce for the Badgers. Although he has taken a more open public stance recently, Brown has named Wisconsin his top school in the past and the Badgers are considered the team to beat in this recruitment. Any decision, though, would not be announced publicly until his senior season and there is still a lot of recruiting, and many more visits, to go before this one is over.\nEdit',

    text: 'NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – Sonny Melton, of Paris, Tennessee, was among the 59 people murdered in Las Vegas when a gunman opened fire on thousands of concert goers late Sunday night.\nMelton was enjoying the Jason Aldean concert with his wife, Heather, and reportedly died shielding her from the gunfire. She was never physically injured.\nPHOTOS: Shooting on the Vegas strip\nIn the wake of his passing, the 29-year-old’s father took to Facebook, penning an emotional open letter about his son’s life and death, and his family’s struggle with their new reality after the nation’s deadliest mass shooting to date.\nBelow are the unedited words of James Warren Melton, use with his permission:\nMy Thoughts about Sonny and heroes.\nIf my calculations are correct, In my 62 years, I have seen about 22,623 sunrises in my life. As of this past Sunday morning, I had never really experienced one that I couldn’t find at least some good in and I had never, ever hated anyone. And I mean that, not anyone. Well, as of 12:57 am Monday morning Oct. 1, 2017 I am now well acquainted with both horrible things, a hated day and a hated person.\nThat’s the moment I received the telephone call that everyone, especially a parent fears.\nThe words came fast from the phone’s speaker, too fast as I tried to wake up and shake the sleep stupid feeling off. 30 seconds later, I prayed to be sleep stupid, drunk, having a nightmare or crazy. But, as they say, it is what it is. James Sonny, my youngest son at 29 years of age, was dead. Bullets in his back as he lay over his wife, protecting her as best he could with all he had available, his body. Shot by some sick bastard too cowardly to even look him in his eyes as he snuffed the life out my child. Oh No, this guy did it from 32 floors up and 300 yards away.\nAs I understand it now, it was just bullets fired wildly into a crowd of about 20,000 country music fans. A crowd where Sonny just happened to be with his wife, listening to music. However, this crowd turned out to be a target of several acres in size with a 99% chance to make a hit on a human body with most every single shot fired into it. And in this sea of carnage, Sonny was a hero right up until the bullets pierced his back and lungs and he couldn’t go on.\nBut my tale of heroes doesn’t end there folks, not at all. As Sonny and Heather ran away from the sniper, he always kept his own body between the danger and his wife. A running human shield. Heather says he had his hands on her shoulders and she felt him get hit and start to fall. And even though she was only a few yards from the safety of a concrete retaining wall, she stopped and turned around to kneel by his side. She made a quick exam and yelled for help as dozens of others fell around them. Bullets hitting the concrete so near that the resulting dust irritated her eyes. But she stayed right there and started CPR there out in the open on the cold ground in a last ditch chance to save her husband. Don’t you see, Heather is a hero also. Protected by nothing more than the grace of God’s invisible hands, she stayed with him and I’m comforted now knowing my son didn’t have to die alone.\nAnd that’s not all! Suddenly out of the blue came two more angels. These angels were in the form of two young concert goers who chose not to hide or run away. These two guys braved the hell of that killing field that must have resembled the Marines landing on Omaha Beach. They ran to Sonny and Heather, picked him up and carried him all the way to their pickup truck. There, they loaded Sonny and two other victims into the bed of the truck and raced to the closest hospital. One guy driving, the other helping Heather give CPR to Sonny. We don’t even know these guys names, they asked for no praise or reward. They just said they were sorry they couldn’t have gotten to Sonny quicker. They are heroes!\nBut, it just wasn’t enough. Heather cried as hope slipped away and the doctors in the ER pronounced him dead. Sonny was an ER Nurse himself. Once when I asked him why, he just smiled and in a matter of fact way said “I want to help save people’s lives”. Well, he lived up to that high standard until the very bitter end.\nI know I’m not the first to feel these horrible things, like grief and loss and I’ll certainly not be the last, but I sure wish I could be. Because it hurts, man I mean it really hurts.\nA few years ago, I had a really good friend who was an American Indian. (Now dead from the cancer that robbed him of life in the end) His people have a prayer that he often recited that always touched my heart. I can’t remember it word for word, but I have repeated it often in my own words. “Please God, let me live honorably and when I take my last breath, let me die standing tall protecting my family”. I haven’t had the opportunity to finalized those words yet for me, and it may not even be in my future. But Sonny did. He stood the final test. He was Just a good guy, doing what good guys do. He was a hero.\nI truly thank our Lord that we had Sonny for these past 29 years and I like to believe I even helped him a little grow into the great young man he was.\nSusan, Janie and I made the 5 hour flight to Los Vegas without a total breakdown only because of the employees of Southwest Airlines who went above and beyond to help, one flight attendant even took us by the hand to his personal car and drove us to find Heather in this strange city. I say this so that I don’t loose sight of the fact that there also good people everywhere.\nMy hatred of the shooter may diminish given enough time, again I’m not the first to bare this burden. But right now, that’s not an option. As an ex cop, I share the frustration of the SWAT officer we heard about who was crying because the shooter killed himself before the cops could breach the door and take care of that ugly business themselves. Like I said, a coward.\nTo all the folks who have tried to call or text me or Janie or Susan, please don’t be mad if we didn’t answer. Or If I’ve misspelled words in this letter, it’s difficult to see clearly through tear filled eyes. We are all just overwhelmed right now. Prayers for Sonny, Heather, Susan and Janie and I are appreciated beyond belief. The grief has us now firmly in its relentless grip and this evil day has lasted way too long. Once again my prayer is to just be sleep stupid and have this sadness go away, even for just a few hours till I wake to my new, changed and darker world.\nSonny was a hero.\nClick here for complete coverage of the Las Vegas attack.\n Tennessee man among 58 killed in Las Vegas concert attack',

    text: 'A new pilot project that will allow residents in four wards to raise chickens in their backyards has been approved despite the objections of one city councillor who called the debate “silly” and demanded to know “what the flock is going on at city hall.”\nCouncil spent several hours debating the proposal on Monday but deferred a vote until today.\nUnder the pilot project, residents in Ward 5 Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Ward 13 Parkdale-High Park, Ward 21 St. Paul\'s and Ward 32 Beaches East York will be allowed up to four backyard chickens provided that the eggs they produce are only used for personal consumption and not offered for sale.\nThe proposal also stipulates that residents participating in the program register with the city and permit staff to “attend and inspect” their properties “as deemed necessary.”\nThe pilot project was adopted following a 26-11 vote on Tuesday morning; however Ward 7 Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti abstained from the vote in protest, later telling CP24 that he “flew the coop” because the topic was not “worthy of Ward 7’s time.”\n“I cannot understand for the life of me how we allow these things on the floor of council when there are more substantial issues in the City of Toronto. My constituents don’t want me to vote for these things. That is not what they elected me to do,” Mammoliti told CP24. “We have a budget that is going crazy, we have parks and playgrounds and roads that are insufficient. Those are the things we need to be dealing with; not chicken coops for crying out loud. What the flock is going on at city hall?”\nA number of municipalities in Southern Ontario currently permit backyard chickens, including Brampton and Niagara Falls.\nSpeaking with CP24 prior to Tuesday’s vote, Ward 5 Coun. Justin Di Ciano said that by allowing backyard chickens the city is simply doing what numerous other municipalities already do.\n“We are going to be implementing the same bylaws implemented in cities across Ontario. This is not new. It is not an experiment. It is not like Uber or Airbnb; it is a well-played out process in other municipalities,” he said.\nUnder the proposal adopted by council on Tuesday chickens will be allowed but roosters will remain banned due to the noise they make.\nThe pilot project will take place over a period of up to three years with an interim review slated for 18 months from now.\nPhotos Cage-free chickens stand in a fenced pasture on the Francis Blake organic farm on Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015, near Waukon, Iowa.

During his first term on the Council, Josh demonstrated the integrity, judgment and vision that I trust to keep Portsmouth one of the best places to live and raise a family. Additionally, Josh�s initiative to start a Renewable Energy Committee demonstrates his work ethic and ability to turn ideas into action. Focusing on renewable energy will enable Portsmouth to save money in the long run and help our environment. Further, Josh helped increase composting in the City and supported reduced use of harmful chemicals. Lastly, as a fellow veteran, I appreciate Josh�s advocacy and support of the veteran community in Portsmouth. I commend Josh for his service in the military and for his continued service to our city. I urge you to vote for Josh Denton for City Council. \nRob Stuart',

While Ayers was pessimistic about the GOP’s ability to pass comprehensive tax reform, he maintained that going into the elections without having passed at least one major legislative goal would be a “suicide mission.” \nWealthy donors provide a huge chunk of the funding for campaigns. Though the 2016 election saw a rise in the number of small donations to candidates, these contributions remain tiny in comparison to a number of money donors like those at the St. Regis event give. \nSource: Pulse Subscribe to our mailing list Related Posts:',

    text: 'The Lawyers’ Committee filed an Amicus Brief in the Landmark Redistricting Case.\nWASHINGTON - Today, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, delivered remarks at the Rally to End Partisan Gerrymandering in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, during oral arguments in Gill v. Whitford. The Lawyers’ Committee filed an amicus curiae or “friend of the court” brief in this complicated case challenging the 2011 Wisconsin State Assembly redistricting plan, which brings to the forefront important questions regarding electoral map making and the ability of voters to have an influence in their representation. In Wisconsin, the redistricting map was struck down by a three-judge federal court panel for imposing “burdens on the representational rights of Democratic voters” in gerrymandered districts. While the Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional, it has not provided clear guidance regarding partisan gerrymandering.\nClarke, who attended today’s hearing, made the following statement:\n“While some of the Justices expressed concern about the floodgates of litigation opening, other Justices were focused on the measurable threat presented by gerrymandering and its impact on the integrity of American democracy. It is time for the Court to act now and rule unequivocally that cases of extreme partisan gerrymandering are subject to judicial review. Gill v. Whitford is a clear example of an electoral map drawn by one party in control of its state legislature in a way that maximizes its partisan advantage. The extreme partisanship at issue in Gill v. Whitford presents strong facts for the Court to provide rules that can help guide the efforts of lawmakers. This case is particularly important as a ruling may provide needed clarity for lawmakers as they prepare for the 2020 redistricting cycle.”\nIn considering a remedy to address partisan gerrymandering, the Lawyers’ Committee filed an amicus brief. The brief, filed with the Georgia State Conference of the NAACP, highlights a racial and partisan gerrymandering case filed by the Lawyers’ Committee this year in Georgia. In that case, plaintiffs claim that the redrawing of lines for Georgia House of Representatives Districts 105 and 111, in 2015, was done with a racially discriminatory purpose to favor the election of white incumbents. In considering a remedy for partisan gerrymandering, the Lawyers’ Committee brief urges the Supreme Court to adopt a standard applicable to partisan gerrymandering sufficiently flexible so as to apply to cases like the Georgia case.\nClick here to read the Gill v. Whitford amicus brief filed in the United States Supreme Court by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n### The Lawyers\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, was formed in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy to involve the private bar in providing legal services to address racial discrimination. The principal mission of the Lawyers\' Committee is to secure, through the rule of law, equal justice under law.\nOrganization Links Lawyers\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law LCCRUL (Press Center)',

    text: 'America/Denver Ambassador Christopher Hill Appointed to New Role Korbel School Dean will highlight and expand DU’s commitment to lead in the study of geopolitics and diplomacy \nUniversity of Denver Chancellor Rebecca Chopp announced today that the dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies , Ambassador Christopher R. Hill, will assume a new role with the University as Chief Advisor to the Chancellor for Global Engagement and Professor of the Practice in Diplomacy — a first-of-its-kind role for a major American university. In this newly created role, Hill will provide leadership on the global stage, drawing upon his vast experience and strong relationships around the world. \n“We are living through a moment of dynamic and unpredictable change across the world,” said Chancellor Chopp . “As a university committed to serving the public and global good, we have an opportunity and responsibility to increase our footprint on the global stage. Ambassador Hill has an extraordinary track record of leadership, and his efforts will raise the visibility and reputation of our university. This new and unique model for an American university demonstrates the University of Denver’s commitment to embracing the future of higher education that aligns education with service and reimagines leadership for the 21st century.” \nAmong his new responsibilities, Hill will lead DU’s efforts, on behalf of Chancellor Chopp, to craft a new 21st-century platform for the role of global engagement in higher education. He will work with the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor for Advancement on University-wide international initiatives.

    text: 'Via StockBoardAsset.com,\n\nThe story starts with Cody Wilson, an American crypto-anarchist, free market anarchist, and gun-right activist. He is the founder of Defense Distributed, a non-profit organization that develops and publishes open source gun designs.\n\n*The about section on Defense Distributed describes the company as an ‘anti-monopolist digital publishing’. *\n\nBack in 2013, Defense Distributed gained international attention after it published the world’s first fully 3D-printed gun called the Liberator. Almost immediately, the Statement Department under the Obama administration demanded Mr. Wilson takedown the 3D-printable gun files for possible export control violations. In the first two days, downloads for the 3D-printable gun exceeded 100,000.\n\nWilson argued that he’s legally protected, and says Defense Distributed “is excluded from the ITAR regulations under an exemption for non-profit public domain releases of technical files designed to create a safe harbor for research and other public interest activities”.\n\nMr. Wilson eventually had to remove the Liberator files from the internet, due to State Department pressure.\n\nJumping to 2014, Mr. Wilson received the title as ‘Ghost Gunner’ and was described as a gun manufacture by some for creating AR-15 frames without serial numbers. Defense Distributed offered the internet a package including a CNC milling machine that can turn an aluminum block into an AR-15 lower receiver, the components regulated by state and federal authorities. The machine called ‘Ghost Gunner 2’ (3D-printer) and 80% AR-15 lower receivers are still being sold on Defense Distributed’s website.\n\nUnder the *Gun* Control Act of 1968, it is *illegal* for an unlicensed person to *make* a firearm for sale or distribution. But in Defense Distributed case producing blueprints or just manufacturing 80% of the component is perfectly legal. \n\nIn 2015, Fedex and UPS refused to ship a digital CNC milling machine out of Defense Disturbed. Fedex spokesman told WIRED, “this device is capable of manufacturing firearms, and potentially by private individuals. We are uncertain at this time whether this device is a regulated commodity by local, state or federal governments. As such, to ensure we comply with the applicable law and regulations”.\n\nThe Spectre of homemade firearms prompted California in 2016 to ban ‘Ghost Guns’ but there is no law on the federal level prohibiting anyone from downloading gun blueprints.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Wilson’s group announced a new software for his computer-controlled milling machine to carve out the aluminum frame of an M1911 handgun. According to WIRED, “the latest model of the milling machine can finish a handgun’s frame in about an hour, with minimal human interaction”.\n\nIn a pistol, the frame is the only regulated part and anything else can be purchased online without questions. Defense Distributed has decentralized the entire process of assembling a workable weapon without identification, background check, and serial tracking number. Let’s assume the State Department has read this article and is now in a full blown panic.\n\nAnyone in America now has the ability to own a handgun thanks to Defense Distributed. Highlighted above, California is the only state that has outlawed ‘Ghost Guns’ and it shows how the federal government and even state governments are failing to keep up with technological advances.\n\nPer WIRED,\n\n\n\n*“The ghost gun threat is real and growing,”* says Kevin De Leon, the California state senator who introduced the statewide ghost gun ban.\n\n\n*“Are they being made by gang members? Are they being manufactured to sell to individuals who are prohibited from possessing firearms? Technologies that make it possible for the general public to manufacture guns raise serious questions.”*\n\n\n\nMr. Wilson’s passion to let every American build an industrial quality gun at home is nothing new. Gun part vendors have been selling 80 precent frames and unfinished parts for quite some time.\n\n*But its the method of creation through 3D-printers, which has the United States government in a panic.*\n\nGun control talk will once again become a national subject with Class 3 weapons in focus following today’s tragic mass shooting in Las Vegas . Reports of 58 deaths and 515 injured marks the worst mass shooting in US history .',

    text: '"I heard colleagues confide that any vote for gun safety would lower their NRA scores, making them casualties in the next election."\nby Julia Conley, staff writer 0 Comments Mourners gathered for a candlelight vigil in Las Vegas on Monday night, following a mass shooting that killed at least 59 concert-goers. (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nAs the nation processes another mass shooting, gun control groups, lawmakers, and other public figures were demanding on Tuesday that Congress finally say "enough is enough" and pass legislation to keep assault weapons and high-capacity magazines out of the hands of civilians—but many expressed concern that as the country has seen with other mass shootings, nothing would change.\nTwenty-three firearms were found in the hotel room where Stephen Paddock carried out the shooting Sunday night, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500. While automatic weapons are effectively banned in the U.S., some exceptions allow civilians to obtain them. It\'s also possible—and legal in some cases—to modify semi-automatic weapons, making them capable of firing hundreds of rounds in under a minute. There is currently no federal ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nWhile investigators are still determining the specifics of how Paddock obtained his weapons, gun control advocates say it\'s time to talk about legislation that could prevent the next mass shooting.\nIn a video for GQ , journalist Keith Olbermann called for the National Rifle Association to be designated a "terrorist organization" for its non-negotiable defense of the Second Amendment, a law that was written "to keep the federal government from taking away the right of each state to maintain its own militia" but has become "an excuse for why madmen of whatever heritage or political purpose cannot be stopped from carrying at least 10 long rifles into a hotel room in Las Vegas and setting up a sniper’s nest and killing people."\nBut writing in the New York Times , former Democratic congressman Steve Israel wrote about his experience watching his colleagues take no meaningful action after mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut and Orlando, Florida—largely due to their subservience to the powerful gun lobby.\nIn the days after the murder of 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Israel says, "My confidence ebbed when I heard my colleagues turn this into a debate over the rights of gun owners instead of the right to life of children. In the confines of the members-only elevators, where my colleagues could speak honestly, I heard colleagues confide that any vote for gun safety would lower their NRA scores, making them casualties in the next election."\nThe majority of Americans actually support a variety of gun safety measures, calling Republicans\' fears into question. But regardless of the public\'s desire for common-sense gun control laws like universal background checks, Israel writes that the NRA is "forced to oppose them because of competing organizations . More moderation means less market share. The gun lobby is in a race to see who can become more brazen, more extreme."\nAt Axios, Jonathan Swan wrote that President Donald Trump will also likely decline to go down in history as the American president who was able to get Congress to enact effective gun control legislation, due to his fear of losing the support of "his base."\nWhile Trump was Quote: d on Tuesday as saying, "We\'ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by," members of his inner circle told Swan that "he owes too much to the NRA and its supporters" to push for meaningful change:\n"POTUS (correctly) believes he doesn\'t owe anything to most traditional Republican outside groups, because they didn\'t lift a finger to help him in the election," said a Trump administration source. "NRA is very much the exception. They stayed loyal through it all and kept spending." We\'re told Trump feels a personal connection to the NRA and is close to the NRA\'s top lobbyist, Chris Cox.\nWhile Trump and the rest of the Republican Party opt to demonstrate their unwavering loyalty to the NRA, however, members of the Trump resistance planned to come out in full force on Tuesday to demand stricter enforcement of gun regulations.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License',

    text: '(WASHINGTON) — The United States expelled 15 of Cuba’s diplomats Tuesday to protest its failure to protect Americans from unexplained attacks in Havana, plunging diplomatic ties between the countries to levels unseen in years. Only days ago, the U.S. and Cuba maintained dozens of diplomats in newly re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington, powerful symbols of a warming relationship between longtime foes. Now both countries are poised to cut their embassies by more than half, as invisible, unexplained attacks threaten delicate ties between the Cold War rivals. The State Department gave Cuba’s ambassador a list Tuesday of 15 names and ordered them out within one week, officials said, in a move that aims to “ensure equity” between each nation’s embassy staffing. Last week, the U.S. announced it was withdrawing 60 percent of its own diplomats from Havana because they might be attacked and harmed if they stay. The dual moves marked a sharp escalation in the U.S. response to attacks that began nearly a year ago and yet remain unexplained despite harming at least 22 Americans — including a new victim identified this week. Still, U.S. officials emphasized they were not accusing Cuba of either culpability or complicity, merely a failure to stop whatever is happening to Americans working out of the U.S. Embassy in Havana. Investigators continue exploring the possibility of a “sonic attack” harming diplomats through sound waves, but have discovered no device and identified no culprit. “We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,” said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Cuba’s Embassy in Washington did not respond to multiple requests for comment. President Raul Castro’s government denies involvement in the attacks, and is likely to view the move as unwarranted retaliation. The U.S. also disclosed that the scope of the attacks has continued to grow, with a 22nd victim confirmed on Monday. In recent weeks the State Department had said there were 21 individuals “medically confirmed” to be affected by attacks that harmed their hearing, cognition, balance and vision, some with diagnoses as serious as brain injury. The additional victim was attacked in January but wasn’t confirmed to have been affected until symptoms prompted a new medical re-evaluation, said the State Department official, who briefed reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity. Both the U.S. and Cuba will see their diplomatic staffing in their embassies drop to the lowest levels in years. Before full diplomatic relations were restored in 2015, Cuba had about two-dozen accredited staffers at what was then the Cuban interests section, according to a State Department list. That number at times climbed as high as more than 50, and the latest edition of the U.S. “Diplomatic List” identifies 26 accredited Cubans at the embassy, almost all accompanied by spouses. The removal of 15 will reduce the Cuban staffing to roughly a dozen accredited diplomats. In Havana, the U.S. had roughly 54 diplomats in its embassy until deciding Friday to pull more than half of them out and leave behind only “essential personnel.” The departing Americans are expected to have all left Cuba by week’s end, officials said. The Cuban diplomats being expelled will not be deemed “persona non grata,” officials said, a designation that would prevent them from ever returning to U.S. soil. The government often uses that designation to expel suspected foreign spies and ensure they can’t come back. Lawmakers who had called on the Trump administration to expel all of Cuba’s diplomats applauded the move Tuesday. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and vocal critic of Castro’s government, called it “the right decision” in a Twitter post. Yet U.S. officials said the goal wasn’t to punish the communist-run island, but to ensure both countries have a similar number of diplomats in each other’s capitals. Tensions between the two neighbors have been escalating amid serious U.S. concern about the unexplained attacks. On Monday, The Associated Press reported that U.S. spies were among the first and most severely affected victims. Though bona fide diplomats have also been affected, it wasn’t until intelligence operatives, working under diplomatic cover, reported bizarre sounds and even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, several individuals familiar with the situation said. The mysterious “health attacks” started within days of President Donald Trump’s election in November, the AP has reported. Delivering a one-two punch to U.S.-Cuba relations, the U.S. last week also delivered an ominous warning to Americans to stay away from Cuba, a move that could have profound implications for the island’s travel industry. The U.S. said that since some workers had been attacked in Havana hotels, it couldn’t assure Americans who visit Cuba that they wouldn’t suffer attacks. “Because our personnel’s safety is at risk, and we are unable to identify the source of the attacks, we believe U.S. citizens may also be at risk and warn them not to travel to Cuba,” the United States said in a formal travel warning. Two years ago, Castro and former President Barack Obama restored diplomatic ties, ordered embassies re-opened and eased travel and commerce restrictions. Trump has reversed some changes but has broadly left the rapprochement in place. To medical investigators’ dismay, symptoms have varied widely. In addition to hearing loss and concussions, some people have experienced nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. The AP has reported that some now suffer from problems with concentration and common word recall. The incidents stopped for a time, but recurred as recently as late August.',

    text: 'OUR VIEWPOINT: Protests are part of America\'s fabric MICHAEL MORRIS 1 \nIt is a mainstay of modern American discourse at the core over the debate about whether professional football players should kneel during the playing of the national anthem before games. That is to divert from the actual issue and frame it as a question of patriotism. Questions of whether the players have a right to protest or are right in what they’re protesting are lost in the chest-pounding and flag-waving. It wouldn’t be surprising if neither side — the loudest critics and those quietly kneeling — truly understand what is at issue. \nMost likely neither side cares that the protests started more than a year ago when a mediocre quarterback chose to sit out the anthem to bring awareness to what he believes is unequal treatment of African-Americans by law enforcement. Some players jumped on that bandwagon without much notice then, many of whom before and since have worked away from the field to build a better community relationship between police and African-Americans. \nThat no longer matters, though, as the debate now is clearly over whether what someone does when the national anthem is playing is an affront to every person who ever served in the military and a sign of hatred for the country they call home. Diversion successful. \nIt’s not a question in our minds whether athletes in any sport should stand for the national anthem, and that is a reasonable discussion to have among reasonable people. But that is not the debate we are having. It should be clear to anyone that the players, owners, fans, cheerleaders and mascots all have the right to sit, kneel or wait obliviously in the concession stand line for a beer while the anthem is performed if that is what they choose to do. \nWe also shouldn’t overlook that the kerfuffle last weekend started not with the NFL but with a professional basketball player, Steph Curry, who said he didn’t think he wanted to join his Golden State Warriors teammates for the traditional White House visit to celebrate their NBA championship. He’s not the first athlete to take that stance — Baltimore Ravens player Matt Birk skipped his team’s trip out of disagreement with President Barack Obama’s pro-choice politics. Boston Red Sox slugger Manny Ramirez didn’t go when George W. Bush occupied the White House. \nThis time, though, President Donald Trump took affront to Curry’s stance and rescinded the invitation. Hours later came his attack against the NFL and its players. Most of the NFL players who kneeled likely did so more in response to Trump using a term insulting to their mothers in criticizing the NFL protestors, something a sitting president ought not to do but has every right to do. \nYou might notice the correlation is that we are not talking about whether we believe the form of protest or the president’s statements is appropriate, insulting or disrespectful. It is that they all have a right to behave or say exactly what they did. We don’t have to agree with them or like them — or stay quiet about whether we do. It is our right as Americans, just as it is their right as Americans to protest. \nNowhere in the Bill of Rights are there stipulations as to what hours, locations or viewpoints are acceptable in expressing our free speech rights. Our rights to protest and speak out against what we view as oppression or disrespect for our country are as much a fabric of our nation as the red, white and blue threads in our flag. \nWe can disagree with what the players have to say or act, treat our president and his tweets with disdain and choose to tune them both out. No one makes us listen or watch things that make us angry, or support causes or actions we find offensive. That is our right. \nAnd we don’t get to decide who has that right and who doesn’t. \nToday’s editorial was written by Michael Morris, managing editor for The Facts. ×',

(China) may even do better than that,” he said.\nXie was in Hong Kong to receive one of the three Lui Che Wo prizes for his efforts in tackling global warming. He will be donating the HK$20 million prize money to the Tsinghua University Education Foundation. He is the winner in the sustainability category.\nEarlier this year, US President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw his government’s ratification of the international agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. He said at the time that the agreement “is less about the climate and more about other nations gaining a financial advantage over the United States”.\nTrump’s decision reversed a key pillar of former President Barack Obama’s effort to combat an increase in global temperatures, which scientists say has been hastened by the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels.\nThe move also cedes global climate action leadership to China.\nXie said that the US’s withdrawal would not harm China’s commitment to fight climate change. China’s position on the agreement has been very clear, he said, as President Xi Jinping has already made clear that the agreement did not come easily and so should not give up on it easily .\nThe chief negotiator also said that the US’s withdrawal would not harm other countries in fulfilling their commitments, saying that many countries have already stated they would adhere to the agreement.\nOn his thoughts about receiving the prize, Xie said it is more than a personal encouragement.\n“It is not only a great encouragement to me,” he said.\n“But also the recognition of our country’s long-term efforts and achievement of coordinating of both domestic and international dimensions, transiting from tackling the challenge of climate change to promoting the historic opportunity to achieve sustainable development and pushing the transition towards green low-carbon development.”\nAwards in the other two categories – positive energy and welfare betterment – went respectively to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and Landesa, a non-governmental organisation based in the US that has helped to secure land rights for 120 million poor rural families in 50 countries since 1967.',

Rarer still are common understanding and readiness among U.S. agencies facing this threat. However, recent legislation and a survey of the nation’s emergency management capabilities underscore the need to prepare even for low-probability but high-impact acts of agroterrorism. \nOrange County, California, is ICE ’s island of support in sanctuary state (Patrick Michels, Reveal ) From all outward signs, Orange County seems to be on the cusp of change. Yet Trump’s presidency also reinvigorated the county’s conservatives, who once again are leading the movement to increase deportations and override the state’s protections for people living in the U.S. illegally.',

They set a “buy” rating and a $200.00 price target on the stock. 9/29/2017 – Vertex Pharmaceuticals is now covered by analysts at DA Davidson. They set a “buy” rating and a $200.00 price target on the stock. 9/27/2017 – Vertex Pharmaceuticals had its “buy” rating reaffirmed by analysts at BMO Capital Markets. 9/26/2017 – Vertex Pharmaceuticals was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “strong-buy” rating. They now have a $174.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, “Vertex is focused on cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments. The company has two CF drugs – Kalydeco & Orkambi – in its portfolio with blockbuster potential. Its efforts to get the drugs approved for additional indications are encouraging. Label expansion will increase the patient population and boost sales. Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Investor focus is on triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth at Vertex as they have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. We are encouraged by the recent positive data from three of the triple combination regimens. The stock has also shot up so far this year. However, Vertex has faced many challenges with respect to commercialization of Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets due to re-imbursement hurdles. Orkambi’s EU reimbursement remains a key for sales growth in 2H17.” 9/21/2017 – Vertex Pharmaceuticals was downgraded by analysts at Vetr to a “sell” rating. 9/17/2017 – Vertex Pharmaceuticals had its “buy” rating reaffirmed by analysts at Needham & Company LLC.

    text: 'Call to businesses to support £100K challenge to fund Cambridge cancer scientists Call to businesses to support £100K challenge to fund Cambridge cancer scientists 4/10/2017 BUSINESSES in Cambridge are being urged to help beat cancer by supporting a ground-breaking research project that’s taking place in the city. \nScientists and doctors in Cambridge, who are funded by Cancer Research UK, are testing a revolutionary imaging technique at Addenbrooke’s that could show whether a cancer drug is working or not within a day or two of treatment starting. \nThis is exciting, innovative research that is expensive to carry out. That’s why Cancer Research UK and the Cambridge Independent are joining forces to set the city’s businesses a challenge – can we raise £100k in 12 months to fund this local research? \nThis is a chance for you and your employees to get behind something linked directly to cancer research in Cambridge. The lead researchers on the trial are Professor Kevin Brindle and Dr Ferdia Gallagher. Since 2013, they have been working together to develop a new type of MRI scan that can be used to spot when cancers first start responding to treatment. \nProfessor Brindle and Dr Gallagher were the first in Europe to test this ground-breaking technique in patients, and they are continuing their work at Addenbrooke’s Hospital right now. Their imaging research* involves patients who are being treated for a wide range of cancer types. \nThe money raised through this fundraising campaign will be used to fund a research project which aims to determine if a breast cancer drug is working for patients. \nIt’s thought the drug will work for some patients, but not others. By using this new imaging technique, the research group aims to determine as quickly as possible which patients it does work for. \nThe funding would cover the cost of materials, research in the lab and help to develop this revolutionary imaging technique. \nHeidi Connell, Cancer Research UK’s Senior Local Fundraising Manager, said: “This is a one off opportunity to support a research project which could have a big impact on those around you and on future generations. \n“We are very excited to have this research going on in Cambridge. If it’s successful, this new imaging technique could change how we treat patients in the future. \n“Improvements and developments in technology like this have the potential to give each cancer patient a better chance of surviving their disease. It’s this type of intelligent, innovative thinking that’s going to help us accelerate progress and beat cancer sooner. So please get behind the appeal and support this local research.” \nRight now, doctors use the size of a tumour to determine if a treatment is working or not. If it stops growing or starts shrinking, then treatment’s classified as working. If the tumour doesn’t shrink or stop growing, treatment’s classed as having failed. \nBut Professor Brindle and Dr Gallagher don’t believe this is the most accurate or fastest way of monitoring if treatment is working. Instead, they believe measuring the chemical activity of tumour cells would be better. \nThis is because cancer cells that are responding to treatment shut down and die quickly, meaning their chemical activity is lower than cells that aren’t responding to treatment. \nCurrently, patients must wait for weeks or months to find out if a treatment is working or not. But doctors believe this wait is too long. \nThe hope is that the new technique will speed up this process and ultimately, be used to help more people with all types of cancer get the treatment that’s right for them faster. \nIt could also be used to identify which patients should stop taking drugs that aren’t working for them, allowing them to try different ones and receive the best treatment for their cancer sooner. \nProfessor Kevin Brindle, co-lead based at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, said: “We’re very excited to be the first group to test this technique in patients and we hope that it will soon improve treatment – and put an end to giving patients treatments that don’t work for them, along with unpleasant side effects that accompany them. Each person’s cancer is different and this technique could help us tailor a patient’s treatment faster than ever.” \nDr Ferdia Gallagher, co-lead also funded by Cancer Research UK and based at the Department of Radiology at the University of Cambridge, said: “It’s fantastic that we are able to try this technique in patients. We hope this will progress the way cancer treatment is given and make therapy more effective for patients in the future. This new technique could potentially mean that doctors will find out much more quickly if a treatment is working for their patient instead of waiting to see if a tumour shrinks.” \nFor more information on how to get involved and how your business will benefit, please email: \nTo support the trial visit: www.justgiving.com/fundraising/cambridgeresearchproject \nAbout Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute \nThe Cambridge Institute turns 10 this year. Here are some of the highlights from the first decade: Found that breast cancer is not one, but at least 10 different diseases in the METABRIC study. Pioneered the use of blood tests to get important information about cancer Started 20 clinical trials and has been involved in at least 20 others Teamed up with labs from as far afield as Australia and Japan in world-wide cancer-beating collaborations. Looked to outer space to beat cancer. They’ve been working with astronomers to improve our microscopes. Trained 142 junior scientists – the next generation of world-leading researchers. Published 1200 scientific papers \nCambridge Institute is a site of world-renowned scientific excellence and houses 420 staff from around 32 countries. \nwww.cruk.cam.ac.uk \n* The project is being led jointly by Professor Kevin Brindle (Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute) and Dr Ferdia Gallagher (Department of Radiology) and involves a large number of co-investigators and collaborators in the University of Cambridge and at Addenbrooke’s hospital including Professor David Lomas (Radiology), Professor Ian Wilkinson (Department of Medicine), Dr Bristi Basu (Oncology) and Mrs Anita Chhabra (Pharmacy). \nThe facility and clinical trials are funded and supported by the Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK, Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust, the Cambridge Cancer Centre, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, GE Healthcare and the University of Cambridge. \nThe research is also funded by the Wellcome Trust strategic award \nThe Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK-CI) aims to bring the scientific strengths of Cambridge to bear on practical questions of cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention.',

I think we are starting to make that point now,” he added.',

Publicly, the British government has said the U.S. imposition of punitive duties on Bombardier is disproportionate, but privately it believes Canada has gone too far in subsidizing Bombardier, according to the report. The U.K. feels it is caught in the crossfire of the dispute, which poses a dilemma for Prime Minister May on two fronts: At stake are more than 4K jobs at Bombardier’s plant in Belfast, which also strains her alliance with 10 Northern Ireland lawmakers propping up her minority government, but it also strains her relationship with the U.S.',

Changing seasons \nTo gain a better understanding of what’s causing the scale of road kill among pheasants, researchers looked at data from the early 1960s and the modern era. Fifty years ago there were far fewer of the species in the UK and most were wild bred. \nNow, experts estimate that about 35 million pheasants are captive bred by the shooting industry across the UK every year. \nBetween 2013 and 2016 38.1% of reported road kill birds were pheasants. \nImage copyright Bev Milne \nFifty years ago the worst time for road collisions with pheasants was in the breeding season in early summer. That has changed significantly, say the authors, and is the result in some measure of captive breeding. \n“We see this spike in road kill in October. That’s the time when the captive bred birds start to disperse from their release pens,” said Dr Joah Madden from the University of Exeter, who led the study. \n“Because they have been reared in the absence of any adults they have no one to show them how to live and so they walk around and get killed, they have no prior experience.” \nDr Madden says that there is also a second peak in March or April. He believes that this is because commercial shoots put out food for the birds during the season. When that ends, so does the food supply. The birds have to forage more widely and end up being hit by traffic. \nWhile the researchers had expected to see an increase in the proportion of pheasants being killed they were surprised to find it was consistent with the rate of attrition found in the 1960s. \nThe experts suspect that changes in behaviour among the gamekeepers in terms of feeding and keeping birds away from the roads may be limiting the level of road kill. \nImage copyright Getty Images \nNatural behaviours and other factors are also likely playing a role in the continuing slaughter, with the chances of pheasants being killed on the roads almost 12 times higher than their share of the bird population would warrant. \n“It may be to do with their small brains, but it’s mainly to do with the fact that they are mainly terrestrial,” said Dr Madden. \n“They are not the world’s best fliers and I think the numbers reported killed are high because they are easily spotted in their glorious plumage.” \nDespite the heavy toll on their numbers, Dr Madden says pheasants would persist in the UK even if they were not being bred for shooting. \nThe research team used road kill data provided by the citizen science group, Project Splatter. \n“Our work demonstrates how changes in animal behaviour can be revealed by road kill data reported by members of the public, and the value of citizen science,” said Dr Sarah from Cardiff University who co-ordinates the project. \nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook \nBrought to you by Planet Genius If You Liked This Article, Join our Newsletter To Receive More Great Articles You may also like',

    text: 'The decision to ban shale extraction in Scotland has signalled the Scottish Government "turning its back on a potential manufacturing and jobs renaissance", according to Ineos Shale. \nOperations director Tom Pickering warned that Scotland will miss out on economic and employment benefits, including an estimated 3,100 jobs. \nIt comes after the Scottish Government said that fracking "cannot and will not take place in Scotland". \n \nREAD MORE: Scottish Government announces fracking ban \nShale gas is currently processed in Scotland at an Ineos site in Grangemouth, but it has been shipped in from abroad. \nMr Pickering said: "It is a sad day for those of us who believe in evidence-led decision making. The Scottish Government has turned its back on a potential manufacturing and jobs renaissance and lessened Scottish academia\'s place in the world by ignoring its findings. \n"Today\'s decision is a slight on the dedicated professionalism that Scottish workers have pioneered in the North Sea. We lead the world in exploration safety, but I fear we will start to see large numbers of Scottish workers leaving the country to find work as the North Sea oil and gas industry continues to decline. \n"Natural gas will be needed by Scotland for the foreseeable future and production from the North Sea continues to decline. This decision, which beggars belief, means gas becomes a cost for the Scottish economy instead of an ongoing source of income. \n"It speaks volumes about Scottish leadership on the world stage and sends a clear and negative message to any future investors in Scotland. \n"Expert reports have clearly stated that this technology can be applied safely and responsibly - but it will be England that reaps the benefits." \nREAD MORE: Scottish Government announces fracking ban \nKen Cronin, Chief Executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, also voiced disappointment at the decision. \nHe said: "The Scottish Government ignores the advice of its own independent experts and prefers a future where gas will have to be imported with the damage that will do to the economy and the environment. \n"It turns its back on job creation, skills development, an increase in tax receipts and investment in communities. Over the last 20 years, 30 wells have been drilled and produce gas within the Central Belt, without any impact to the natural environment or public health. \n"This is a poor decision, ignoring Scotland\'s rich heritage and expertise in oil and gas. It is not based on the evidence from extensive independent research, which clearly states that with appropriate regulatory oversight and monitoring Scotland\'s regulatory framework is sufficiently robust to manage onshore exploration and production."',

    text: 'Denzil McDaniel: Is division and racism born in you or does it happen as you grow up? Denzil McDaniel: Is division and racism born in you or does it happen as you grow up? \n  \nIt’s a sort of chicken and egg question. As we grow up, is hatred of others inherent in us and we have to be taught to love people different to us? Or do we naturally love others, and are taught by circumstance or people around us to show bitterness towards the “other side”? Looking at division across the world, not least in our own country, it’s an interesting one and it comes to my mind particularly as I watch the “takeaknee” controversy in the United States which sees Donald Trump’s latest row when he lines up against sports stars protesting against treatment of black people. The tension of race hostility has been deep in the American psyche since the slavery days, and even in living memory it’s worth recalling the context of where we are now. Firstly, a couple of little nuggets of information about how different the backgrounds of the last two US presidents were. Donald Trump’s mother was originally from Scotland’s Isle of Lewis; she arrived in New York in 1930 penniless and got work as a domestic to get a better life for herself. Mary Anne MacLeod is exactly the sort of immigrant that her son would like to keep out of the country, but she stayed after marrying the wealthy Trump senior. Barack Obama’s mother was a white woman from Kansas and his father was originally from Kenya. They married in 1961. Interestingly, in that year there were still 17 states in America, particularly in the south where they wouldn’t have been able to get married because it was illegal for black and white people to marry. So by the time Mary Anne MacLeod Trump was enjoying a new life with her wealthy husband, Obama’s father’s black compatriots were far from enjoying civil rights. The black singer, dancer and actor Sammy Davis junior was a high profile figure in the 1960s, politically as well in the entertainment industry. He was valued by the John F Kennedy Presidential election campaign in 1960 and joined a host of celebrities at their Convention. But alone among the celebs, Davis was booed by Democratic delegates when he came on stage. His crime – was to marry a white woman. Remember the movie “Guess who’s coming to dinner” with Sidney Poitier? In more recent times, the issue of mixed marriage between Catholics and Protestants caused consternation in families here, and alone in these islands Northern Ireland still won’t countenance same-sex marriage. So, some issues recur through the ages. Yet in 1964, Sammy Davis junior predicted at a show that there were five-year-old boys in the audience who could grow up and in 40 years become the first Negro to become president. He was to be amazingly only four years out, so obviously America has come a long way. Or has it? In the times he said it, it was in itself a remarkable prediction. There are still images in my mind as a boy of seeing the Civil Rights campaign unfolding. The inspirational non-violence and history-making speeches of Martin Luther King and the grainy coverage of Governor George Wallace standing at the door of the University of Alabama to stop two black students enrolling in the all-white institution. JFK stepped in, federalised the National Guard and the names of the students Vivian Malone and James Hood went into the history books. Probably the most stark was the sight on television at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos climbed on the medal podium, bowed their heads and raised a gloved clenched fist in a “black power” salute as the flag was raised to the sound of the Star-Spangled Banner. To many on this side of the Atlantic, it seemed a worrying development, an act of defiance which hinted at a more violent battle for civil rights. But for students Malone and Hood, for athletes Smith and Carlos, and indeed Muhammad Ali who threw his Olympic boxing medal into the river in disgust at his treatment as a black in his native Louisville, today we read of people like Colin Kaepernick. He’s the American footballer with the San Francisco 49ers who last year knelt on one knee while the national anthem was being played, saying: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour.” Trump has his own inimitable way of responding, with a foul-mouthed “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects the flag, to say ‘get that son of a b**** off the field right now. Out! He’s fired.” Now the controversy is increasing. Surely, not only have people a right to protest, indeed they are showing a greater love for their country by trying to make it better. Where would America be without such heroes as Martin Luther King, who stood up for his people, stood up against injustice and gave his life for his cause. A picture went viral this week of MLK, all those years ago, going down on one knee in prayer. His daughter, Bernice King put it well : “The real shame and disrespect is that, decades after the first photo, racism STILL kills people and corrupts system.” It seems to me to be about more than just a flag. Trump’s presidency seems to have emboldened white supremacists, whose idea of “making America great again” is to return to the good old days when blacks knew their place, which of course to say the least is subservient to them; back to the 1960s and even further. I read that in the first month after Trump was elected in one area in the south of the USA, there were over a thousand incidents described as “hate in America.” They included swastikas in schools, racist taunts, anti-Semitic slogans, pelting Muslim with coins and attacks on the LGBT community. And what a pathetic response by Trump to the events in Charlottesville, when torch-bearing neo-Nazis hit the streets. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine responded to the awful violence and hatred by saying: “This is not who we are.” But many have responded by suggesting, maybe we are. Maybe racism, bigotry and abuse are part of our DNA and we need to be taught to love. What on earth is it that makes us hate and demean people just because the colour of their skin? Of course, that wouldn’t happen here. Pah, would it not? I know of young footballers in this area disgustingly treated because of their colour, and some coaches laugh at their players who do it. And the abuse of people different to the so-called norm was highlighted at the week-end when a centre in Belfast was daubed with “No blacks” and “No Muslims.” So, it’s not “only in America”, it’s in all our hearts. It’s a shame and a blot on mankind. And if we don’t root out bitterness and teach people to respect each other, the division will continue for the hundreds of years the way it does in the Land of the Free.',

    text: 'Email Text Drews Finishes First Season with USA Annie Drews was a standout contributor in her first season with USA Oct. 3,   The end of summer marks the conclusion of USA Volleyball\'s season and the end of perhaps the most exciting chapter in Annie Drews\' volleyball career. Following her MVP season in which she led Caquas Criollas to the Puerto Rican title, she received an invite to train with Team USA and did not disappoint from the moment she arrived in Anaheim, California. Over the course of three tournament appearances and a pair of friendly competitions against Brazil, Drews proved to be one of the top offensive options for the Americans. Beginning with the Pan American Cup in June, Drews led Team USA to its 16th Pan Am Cup in Canete, Peru. The Americans won all seven of their matches defeating Venezuela, Columbia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The Elkhart, Indiana, native hit .370 with 54 kills on 108 swings to lead the United States in hitting percentage and finish tied for the second most kills on the team. After her dominant effort in the Pan Am Cup, she was left off the Grand Prix roster to begin the tournament, allowing her to go back to Anaheim, California, and train in the Team USA system. However, in need of more offense, Team USA added Drews to the FIVB World Grand Prix Final Six roster and she delivered. Despite USA falling in both of its matches in the final six, Drews led the Americans with 25 kills on 65 attempts in six sets of action. Of USA\'s top three point scorers in the finals, Drews was the only player to come off the bench. She appeared in six of a possible nine sets and registered the second most points on the team with 26 to her credit. Following her two tournaments abroad, she finally sported the red, white and blue in her home country as Team USA hosted Brazil in the USA Volleyball Cup. In front of family, friends and Team USA fanatics, Drews posted two of her best efforts in a USA uniform. In back-to-back contests, the right side hitter torched Brazil for 36 points in just six sets of action. USA defeated Brazil in its first match in three sets and chose to play a bonus set, allowing Drews to rack up 21 points with 14 kills, three blocks and an ace coming in the official three sets. The lefty came off the bench in the second match to lead the United States with 12 kills on 21 attempts with just three errors along with three blocks and an ace in just two sets of action. Drews finished her rookie season with USA in the FIVB World Grand Champions Cup in which she helped the Americans to a bronze medal with wins over Korea, Russia and the tournament\'s host, Japan. She finished with the second most points on USA\'s roster, eighth most points in the tournament and just one point shy of her teammate Jordan Larson who took home the Best Spiker Award as part of the tournament\'s Dream Team. Drews posted 69 points with 58 kills, nine blocks and two aces over the course of five matches. Altogether, Purdue\'s all-american alumna appeared in 55 sets for the United States and terminated 164 of her 381 attempts with 57 errors giving her a .281 hitting percentage and a 2.98 kills per set average. She complemented her scoring efforts with 23 blocks and six aces as well. While enjoying her success with Team USA, Drews signed with SASB Volleyball Legano in Italy\'s Serie A2 to continue her professional volleyball career and prepare for her next season with Team USA.',

While Ayers was pessimistic about the GOP’s ability to pass comprehensive tax reform, he maintained that going into the elections without having passed at least one major legislative goal would be a “suicide mission.” \nWealthy donors provide a huge chunk of the funding for campaigns. Though the 2016 election saw a rise in the number of small donations to candidates, these contributions remain tiny in comparison to a number of money donors like those at the St. Regis event give. \nSource: Pulse Subscribe to our mailing list Related Posts:',

    text: 'The Lawyers’ Committee filed an Amicus Brief in the Landmark Redistricting Case.\nWASHINGTON - Today, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, delivered remarks at the Rally to End Partisan Gerrymandering in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, during oral arguments in Gill v. Whitford. The Lawyers’ Committee filed an amicus curiae or “friend of the court” brief in this complicated case challenging the 2011 Wisconsin State Assembly redistricting plan, which brings to the forefront important questions regarding electoral map making and the ability of voters to have an influence in their representation. In Wisconsin, the redistricting map was struck down by a three-judge federal court panel for imposing “burdens on the representational rights of Democratic voters” in gerrymandered districts. While the Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional, it has not provided clear guidance regarding partisan gerrymandering.\nClarke, who attended today’s hearing, made the following statement:\n“While some of the Justices expressed concern about the floodgates of litigation opening, other Justices were focused on the measurable threat presented by gerrymandering and its impact on the integrity of American democracy. It is time for the Court to act now and rule unequivocally that cases of extreme partisan gerrymandering are subject to judicial review. Gill v. Whitford is a clear example of an electoral map drawn by one party in control of its state legislature in a way that maximizes its partisan advantage. The extreme partisanship at issue in Gill v. Whitford presents strong facts for the Court to provide rules that can help guide the efforts of lawmakers. This case is particularly important as a ruling may provide needed clarity for lawmakers as they prepare for the 2020 redistricting cycle.”\nIn considering a remedy to address partisan gerrymandering, the Lawyers’ Committee filed an amicus brief. The brief, filed with the Georgia State Conference of the NAACP, highlights a racial and partisan gerrymandering case filed by the Lawyers’ Committee this year in Georgia. In that case, plaintiffs claim that the redrawing of lines for Georgia House of Representatives Districts 105 and 111, in 2015, was done with a racially discriminatory purpose to favor the election of white incumbents. In considering a remedy for partisan gerrymandering, the Lawyers’ Committee brief urges the Supreme Court to adopt a standard applicable to partisan gerrymandering sufficiently flexible so as to apply to cases like the Georgia case.\nClick here to read the Gill v. Whitford amicus brief filed in the United States Supreme Court by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n### The Lawyers\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, was formed in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy to involve the private bar in providing legal services to address racial discrimination. The principal mission of the Lawyers\' Committee is to secure, through the rule of law, equal justice under law.\nOrganization Links Lawyers\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law LCCRUL (Press Center)',

    text: '(WASHINGTON) — The United States expelled 15 of Cuba’s diplomats Tuesday to protest its failure to protect Americans from unexplained attacks in Havana, plunging diplomatic ties between the countries to levels unseen in years. Only days ago, the U.S. and Cuba maintained dozens of diplomats in newly re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington, powerful symbols of a warming relationship between longtime foes. Now both countries are poised to cut their embassies by more than half, as invisible, unexplained attacks threaten delicate ties between the Cold War rivals. The State Department gave Cuba’s ambassador a list Tuesday of 15 names and ordered them out within one week, officials said, in a move that aims to “ensure equity” between each nation’s embassy staffing. Last week, the U.S. announced it was withdrawing 60 percent of its own diplomats from Havana because they might be attacked and harmed if they stay. The dual moves marked a sharp escalation in the U.S. response to attacks that began nearly a year ago and yet remain unexplained despite harming at least 22 Americans — including a new victim identified this week. Still, U.S. officials emphasized they were not accusing Cuba of either culpability or complicity, merely a failure to stop whatever is happening to Americans working out of the U.S. Embassy in Havana. Investigators continue exploring the possibility of a “sonic attack” harming diplomats through sound waves, but have discovered no device and identified no culprit. “We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,” said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Cuba’s Embassy in Washington did not respond to multiple requests for comment. President Raul Castro’s government denies involvement in the attacks, and is likely to view the move as unwarranted retaliation. The U.S. also disclosed that the scope of the attacks has continued to grow, with a 22nd victim confirmed on Monday. In recent weeks the State Department had said there were 21 individuals “medically confirmed” to be affected by attacks that harmed their hearing, cognition, balance and vision, some with diagnoses as serious as brain injury. The additional victim was attacked in January but wasn’t confirmed to have been affected until symptoms prompted a new medical re-evaluation, said the State Department official, who briefed reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity. Both the U.S. and Cuba will see their diplomatic staffing in their embassies drop to the lowest levels in years. Before full diplomatic relations were restored in 2015, Cuba had about two-dozen accredited staffers at what was then the Cuban interests section, according to a State Department list. That number at times climbed as high as more than 50, and the latest edition of the U.S. “Diplomatic List” identifies 26 accredited Cubans at the embassy, almost all accompanied by spouses. The removal of 15 will reduce the Cuban staffing to roughly a dozen accredited diplomats. In Havana, the U.S. had roughly 54 diplomats in its embassy until deciding Friday to pull more than half of them out and leave behind only “essential personnel.” The departing Americans are expected to have all left Cuba by week’s end, officials said. The Cuban diplomats being expelled will not be deemed “persona non grata,” officials said, a designation that would prevent them from ever returning to U.S. soil. The government often uses that designation to expel suspected foreign spies and ensure they can’t come back. Lawmakers who had called on the Trump administration to expel all of Cuba’s diplomats applauded the move Tuesday. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and vocal critic of Castro’s government, called it “the right decision” in a Twitter post. Yet U.S. officials said the goal wasn’t to punish the communist-run island, but to ensure both countries have a similar number of diplomats in each other’s capitals. Tensions between the two neighbors have been escalating amid serious U.S. concern about the unexplained attacks. On Monday, The Associated Press reported that U.S. spies were among the first and most severely affected victims. Though bona fide diplomats have also been affected, it wasn’t until intelligence operatives, working under diplomatic cover, reported bizarre sounds and even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, several individuals familiar with the situation said. The mysterious “health attacks” started within days of President Donald Trump’s election in November, the AP has reported. Delivering a one-two punch to U.S.-Cuba relations, the U.S. last week also delivered an ominous warning to Americans to stay away from Cuba, a move that could have profound implications for the island’s travel industry. The U.S. said that since some workers had been attacked in Havana hotels, it couldn’t assure Americans who visit Cuba that they wouldn’t suffer attacks. “Because our personnel’s safety is at risk, and we are unable to identify the source of the attacks, we believe U.S. citizens may also be at risk and warn them not to travel to Cuba,” the United States said in a formal travel warning. Two years ago, Castro and former President Barack Obama restored diplomatic ties, ordered embassies re-opened and eased travel and commerce restrictions. Trump has reversed some changes but has broadly left the rapprochement in place. To medical investigators’ dismay, symptoms have varied widely. In addition to hearing loss and concussions, some people have experienced nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. The AP has reported that some now suffer from problems with concentration and common word recall. The incidents stopped for a time, but recurred as recently as late August.',

    text: 'OUR VIEWPOINT: Protests are part of America\'s fabric MICHAEL MORRIS 1 \nIt is a mainstay of modern American discourse at the core over the debate about whether professional football players should kneel during the playing of the national anthem before games. That is to divert from the actual issue and frame it as a question of patriotism. Questions of whether the players have a right to protest or are right in what they’re protesting are lost in the chest-pounding and flag-waving. It wouldn’t be surprising if neither side — the loudest critics and those quietly kneeling — truly understand what is at issue. \nMost likely neither side cares that the protests started more than a year ago when a mediocre quarterback chose to sit out the anthem to bring awareness to what he believes is unequal treatment of African-Americans by law enforcement. Some players jumped on that bandwagon without much notice then, many of whom before and since have worked away from the field to build a better community relationship between police and African-Americans. \nThat no longer matters, though, as the debate now is clearly over whether what someone does when the national anthem is playing is an affront to every person who ever served in the military and a sign of hatred for the country they call home. Diversion successful. \nIt’s not a question in our minds whether athletes in any sport should stand for the national anthem, and that is a reasonable discussion to have among reasonable people. But that is not the debate we are having. It should be clear to anyone that the players, owners, fans, cheerleaders and mascots all have the right to sit, kneel or wait obliviously in the concession stand line for a beer while the anthem is performed if that is what they choose to do. \nWe also shouldn’t overlook that the kerfuffle last weekend started not with the NFL but with a professional basketball player, Steph Curry, who said he didn’t think he wanted to join his Golden State Warriors teammates for the traditional White House visit to celebrate their NBA championship. He’s not the first athlete to take that stance — Baltimore Ravens player Matt Birk skipped his team’s trip out of disagreement with President Barack Obama’s pro-choice politics. Boston Red Sox slugger Manny Ramirez didn’t go when George W. Bush occupied the White House. \nThis time, though, President Donald Trump took affront to Curry’s stance and rescinded the invitation. Hours later came his attack against the NFL and its players. Most of the NFL players who kneeled likely did so more in response to Trump using a term insulting to their mothers in criticizing the NFL protestors, something a sitting president ought not to do but has every right to do. \nYou might notice the correlation is that we are not talking about whether we believe the form of protest or the president’s statements is appropriate, insulting or disrespectful. It is that they all have a right to behave or say exactly what they did. We don’t have to agree with them or like them — or stay quiet about whether we do. It is our right as Americans, just as it is their right as Americans to protest. \nNowhere in the Bill of Rights are there stipulations as to what hours, locations or viewpoints are acceptable in expressing our free speech rights. Our rights to protest and speak out against what we view as oppression or disrespect for our country are as much a fabric of our nation as the red, white and blue threads in our flag. \nWe can disagree with what the players have to say or act, treat our president and his tweets with disdain and choose to tune them both out. No one makes us listen or watch things that make us angry, or support causes or actions we find offensive. That is our right. \nAnd we don’t get to decide who has that right and who doesn’t. \nToday’s editorial was written by Michael Morris, managing editor for The Facts. ×',

    text: 'China is on track to fulfil or possibly surpass its commitment of cutting its carbon intensity by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020, the country’s chief negotiator at the Paris Agreement has said.\nXie Zhenhua said in Hong Kong on Tuesday that despite the United States’ planned withdrawal from the agreement, China’s commitment to fight climate change is unwavering.\nChina has already cut its carbon intensity – the amount of carbon emissions per unit of GDP growth – by 39 per cent this year while sustaining economic growth, said Xie, who is also former head of the State Environmental Protection Administration.\n“There should be no problems meeting the 40 to 45 per cent target in 2020. (China) may even do better than that,” he said.\nXie was in Hong Kong to receive one of the three Lui Che Wo prizes for his efforts in tackling global warming. He will be donating the HK$20 million prize money to the Tsinghua University Education Foundation. He is the winner in the sustainability category.\nEarlier this year, US President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw his government’s ratification of the international agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. He said at the time that the agreement “is less about the climate and more about other nations gaining a financial advantage over the United States”.\nTrump’s decision reversed a key pillar of former President Barack Obama’s effort to combat an increase in global temperatures, which scientists say has been hastened by the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels.\nThe move also cedes global climate action leadership to China.\nXie said that the US’s withdrawal would not harm China’s commitment to fight climate change. China’s position on the agreement has been very clear, he said, as President Xi Jinping has already made clear that the agreement did not come easily and so should not give up on it easily .\nThe chief negotiator also said that the US’s withdrawal would not harm other countries in fulfilling their commitments, saying that many countries have already stated they would adhere to the agreement.\nOn his thoughts about receiving the prize, Xie said it is more than a personal encouragement.\n“It is not only a great encouragement to me,” he said.\n“But also the recognition of our country’s long-term efforts and achievement of coordinating of both domestic and international dimensions, transiting from tackling the challenge of climate change to promoting the historic opportunity to achieve sustainable development and pushing the transition towards green low-carbon development.”\nAwards in the other two categories – positive energy and welfare betterment – went respectively to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and Landesa, a non-governmental organisation based in the US that has helped to secure land rights for 120 million poor rural families in 50 countries since 1967.',

    host: '1776coalition.com',
    text: 'by 1776 Coalition October 3, 2017 \nReaching for a political solution after Sunday night’s horrific shooting in Las Vegas, congressional Democrats on Monday said lawmakers’ words of comfort will ring hollow unless Congress “does something” about gun violence. \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for a new special select congressional committee to study the issue, saying Congress has a “moral duty” to address it. \nMeanwhile former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was herself seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting targeting her, told Congress “the nation’s counting on you” to change the laws. \nBut most of all, gun control advocates on Capitol Hill pleaded with colleagues not to become “numb” to the violence they said seems to be coming at a far too frequent pace. Read the full article: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/2/nancy-pelosi-gabrielle-giffords-pressure-congress-/ Share this: metheoldsarge \nLiberals aren’t wasting any time to take advantage of this to push their gun grabbing agenda in their true selfish shameless grandstander fashion. Hillary, Blumenthal, Murphy, Warren, Sanders, Markley, Moulton, Maloney Pelosi and Biden wasted no time to jump in with both feet and throw in their two cents on Gun Control. Everything from condemning and blaming the NRA, to blaming Congress for not passing more strict gun control laws. If they added any remorse for the victims or their families, I must have missed it. In fact, in my opinion, Moulton gave a direct slap in the face to all the victims and their families by refusing to stand in silence. \nAnyone else notice one thing this and other similar incidents have in common? I haven’t heard any Democrats or RINOs coming out against BLM, ANTIFA or any other hate groups. Democrat and Liberal supporters love to call Republicans and conservatives Fascists. Let’s take a look at some tactics used by Democrat supporters lately: \nThe day after the election, Hillary supporters were so upset they threw a tantrum in Downtown Washington DC. They smashed windows to business establishments and even set a limousine on fire. A Liberal supporting shooter fires at Republican politicians because of party affiliation. A Liberal supporter and Trump hater, murders his Republican neighbor, a Republican committeeman just for being a Republican. Liberal supporters send threats to Republican Candidate Handel by mail along with some powder. Her neighbors, family and friends also received similar threats in the mail from Liberal supporters. People who display Republican campaign signs get their homes vandalized and families threatened by Liberal supporters. Liberal supporters do everything possible to stop conservatives from using their First Amendment rights. Liberal supporters disrupt conservative meetings or gatherings and make threats. All during the 2016 campaign, Trump rallies were disrupted by Liberal supporters. On several occasions Trump supporters were physically assaulted. Liberal supporters make false police reports on conservatives. \nThe list goes on. \nThese are the kind of cowardly tactics that Fascists use and then accuse their victims of being Fascists. Right out of Saul Alinski’s play book. Top Democrats like the Clinton’s, Schumer, Sanders, Holder, Lynch, Pelosi and their Liberal colleagues should be vehemently and publicly condemning these types of actions. Their silence is deafening. Being quiet indicates to me that top Democrats encourage, support, and/or condone such cowardly Fascist tactics. Anyone, who would condone these cowardly acts, are people I would not want representing me in Washington. Their hypocrisy is showing. Brad \nNew regulations? Yeah, I’m sure all the weapons were all purchased perfectly legally and not purchased out of the trunk of someone’s car. Criminals don’t commit gun crimes with guns in their own name, you stupid politicians. Laws won’t do shit. Jose \nHas the flosie even handled a weapon before or know safe it is unless the person using a weapon does not use common sense. The issue is that if weapons are taken away from law abiding citizens then only criminals will have weapons. They have no respect for weapon control so why tie the hand of those who make criminals think twice about using a weapon. The Redhawk \nWell What will the IDIOT and the Equally Stupid (D) Anarchy party members and their “talking heads from Night Shows Propose??? ENFORCING the GUN laws in CHicago nigh;y shooting Gallery??? REvisit San Bernardino or the SAN FRan Sanctuary city killing??? Do they Know that the Las Vegas shooter bought an ARSENAL the Legal way by fillling all necessary Background FBI papers before the guns can be SOLD to him>> Yes the same as I or anyone else has to do??? Or are these IDIOTS who only work for Themselves and Speacial Interests just occupy Space and DO NOTHING ELSE??? CBUJAN \nThis is the hypocrisy of the left, they always use a tragedy to put forth their agenda. Pelosi and the rest of the dumb shits doesn’t realize that no law would have prevented this tragedy. We have over 20,000 gun laws on the books and not one of them or any new laws would have prevented this evil tragedy. The shooter use a machine gun and it is illegal to own one, so where did the shooter acquire it. This is what the stupid democrats have to look into. How to stop illegal gun sales, this is what they need to focus on not some stupid law that will only affect law abiding citizens. justinwachin \nFrom what I’ve read this murderer had no criminal record and was not on any watch list. Assuming all the Obama-era gun control laws had been enacted, how would they have stopped this man? \nThe thing which is often forgotten in these situations is the murderer would probably have chosen another weapon if guns had not been available. \nIt is likely we will never be able to stop all murderers from committing their evil acts. Although the Las Vegas shooting was a tragedy let’s not forget more Americans had their lives ended in abortion clinics on Monday than what died at the concert. If Pelosi and Giffords are truly interested in saving American lives they could shut down the abortion clinics. \nEvery year more Americans die in abortion clinics than die from gun violence. The abortion scourge could be ended today. Of course, that would mean that Nancy Pelosi would lose the blood money she collects from the baby slaughter industry. metheoldsarge \nI agree. Had he stolen a heavy truck or bus, he could have crashed through the gates and put a lot more people in the hospital and the morgue. Christopher Riddle \nEarth To”Stretch”;Why Don’t You Make It MORE Illegal To Kill People With Guns???? Jmanjo \nYou cannot take anything these two women say as practical or forthcoming in the est interests for America. Both have a hole in their arguments and neither have a sane thought to fill them with! Pelosi has already tried to push people to breaking the law to achieve her political agenda and Giffords claim to fame is being a shooting victim! Neither of their positions make any sense when dealing with the security of our citizens. What has also been interesting is to hear the reporting by the media concerning the weapons the shooter used and it shows how naive they are, incompetent about weapons to make remarks, and fake about most of the details as their reporting is designed to confuse the public about the whole event so they can use it for their agenda! Smitch \nGoing out today and purchase another AR-10, just for all you Liberals out there! The Redhawk \nMany also ARE!!!! The enemy is in DC … and many are (D) Anarchists Smitch \nMaybe the firearms are tied back to Obama & Holder? Remember Fast & Ferious! Christopher Riddle \nThat makes TWO of us The Redhawk \nNAHH those two IDIOTS became Amarica’s Number ! and 2 GUN salesmen for 8 years …. their policies drove Many of US to GUN UP!!! Pamela Rodman Lindenmeyer \nThe psychos that use the guns are the problem. Guns don’t operate on their own. Get some of those people back on in-patient treatment instead of pushing them all into outpatient treatment where they can’t be adequately monitored. The health insurance companies did this 20 years ago and we are now seeing the result of it. Marine68 \nThey do not care one whit for the public safety; They seek to insure their own safety. Corruption and stealth murder is their game, and they want no chance of anybody holding them responsible for any of it. Thank god for our Rights, and the Constitution they want so dearly to do away with for guaranteeing those Rights. The Second Amendment was not an afterthought, it was an enforceable reminder to would be tyrants. The Redhawk \nAll the Elercted IDIOTS do is Speak to EMPTY Senate and House Seats to be seen via C-Span….Work for Lobbyists and Special Interests to get Mutually RICHER and DO NOTHING ELSE but Spread VOMIT viat MSM…. jfbtx \nAnother knee jerk reaction by the left. Those were the sounds of a fully automatic weapon. The only way to own one is to have a special FFL license which is almost impossible for anyone to obtain. It sounded like a M60. It wasn’t something than 99% of people could obtain anyway. Most likely illegally purchased to start out with. Do not let your freedoms be taken away by listening to these leftist liberals. Take a close look at every country that have given up their right to self-defense and protection, they all live in a police state. Fidel castro \nOf course the democrates want gun control, after all, all mass shootings in modern history where carried out by registered democrates! Wake up america. BethanyJWood Google is paying 97$ per hour,with weekly payouts.You can also avail this.

    text: '(Before It\'s News)\nI don’t blame him. Trump has enough heat burning up his backside over Russia.\nA new report says chief of staff John Kelly is standing in the way of California Representative Dana Rohrabacher, who desperately wants to get to the president.\nRohrabacher claims to have ironclad proof that Russia did not hack into the emails of the Democratic National Committee before the 2016 election. Namely, his proof consists of the word of Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange.\nSorry, Congressman. “Because Julian said so” isn’t really firm proof, but, whatever.\nStill, Rohrabacher claims he has something of value to offer, if only he could get to President Trump.\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) told Business Insider on Tuesday that Kelly and other top Trump aides are actively blocking him from meeting with the president to discuss information from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that Assange claims proves Russia didn’t interfere in the 2016 election.\n“The White House staff and other top people in the administration are trying to protect the president from himself,” Rohrabacher said, according to Business Insider. “That’s what they think and in fact they are usurping his authority to make decisions — the important decisions — himself.”\nThat’s because they know you’re trouble, Julian Assange is trouble, and this push to make Russia out to be innocents in all this just doesn’t flush, given what we know and regarding what our intelligence community believes.\nRohrabacher went on to point out several things.\nFor starters, even though he traveled to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to talk to Julian Assange earlier this year, he claims he isn’t talking with him now. At least, he’s not talking with him directly, but rather, through intermediaries.\nAlso, while he’s being blocked from speaking to Trump, he has go-betweens who are carrying messages to the president for him.\n“I have not spoken to [Assange] directly, but we’re going through a period of time where a lot’s getting done one person removed in a lot of different ways,” he said.\n“Our three-hour meeting covered a wide array of issues, including the WikiLeaks exposure of the DNC [Democratic National Committee] emails during last year’s presidential election,” Rohrabacher said at the time. “Julian emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved in the hacking or disclosure of those emails.”\n“Julian also indicated that he is open to further discussions regarding specific information about the DNC email incident that is currently unknown to the public,” he added.\nYes. He’s tried that, before.\nIf I remember correctly, Assange promised to agree to extradition to the U.S., on the condition of Bradley Manning’s sentence for leaking secrets about the Iraq War to Wikileaks be commuted.\nThen-President Obama commuted Manning’s sentence (claiming it wasn’t because of Assange’s conditions for extradition), only to have Assange later say his conditions weren’t met, therefore, he wouldn’t allow himself to be extradited.\nAssange has been the subject of an espionage investigation in the United States and was wanted in Sweden for allegations of rape.\nU.S. intelligence agencies have suggested that Wikileaks works closely with the government of Russia, as well.\nAnd this is the kind of moral slug Rep. Rohrabacher wants to vouch for to the president.\nThe post John Kelly Is Blocking This Pro-Russia Congressman’s Access to the President appeared first on RedState .\nSource: https://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2017/10/03/john-kelly-blocking-pro-russia-congressmans-access-president/',

Hawaii News Now via AP, File) Man in flight disturbance case was hallucinating butterfly By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER Associated Press October 03, 2017 9:02 PM HONOLULU \nA Turkish man pleaded guilty Tuesday to interfering with a flight crew and blamed his inflight behavior that prompted fighter jets to escort the plane to its Honolulu destination on hallucinating that he was chasing a butterfly. \nA butterfly suddenly came out of the front pocket of the seat in front of him, Anil Uskanli said in a Honolulu federal court Tuesday in describing what he did during the May 19 American Airlines flight from Los Angeles. "The butterfly went crazy ... flew into the toilet," he said. "I followed it. I tried to kill it by punching it." \nUskanli, 25, said he now realizes that he was ill and hallucinating. \nTo flight crew and passengers, Uskanli\'s behavior was concerning, including when he walked to the front of the plane with a blanket wrapped around his head and carrying a laptop crew members feared contained explosives, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Brady said. \nAfter Uskanli returned to his seat and with an off-duty officer sitting with him, the laptop remained on a drink cart, which prompted the captain to initiate bomb-threat procedures, Brady said. \nThe Hawaii National Guard scrambled two fighter jets to escort the plane to Honolulu. The secretary of Homeland Security was briefed. \nUskanli raised other red flags while still at Los Angeles International Airport, but experts said a lack of communication and an airline\'s hesitancy to be caught on video booting a passenger played a role in allowing him to fly. In April, a United Airlines incident in which a passenger was dragged off an overcrowded plane drew widespread attention. \nUskanli had purchased a ticket at an airline counter in the middle of the night with no luggage and was arrested ahead of the flight to Hawaii after opening a door to a restricted airfield. Airport police said he smelled of alcohol but was not intoxicated enough to be charged with public drunkenness, so he was given a citation and released. \nAfter the flight landed in Honolulu and Uskanli was arrested, a judge ordered a mental competency evaluation at the request of his defense attorney. He was sent to a federal detention facility in Los Angeles to undergo the evaluation. \nWhen Uskanli returned to Honolulu, defense attorney Richard Sing tried to have a hearing on his mental competency and detention closed to the public. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kenneth Mansfield initially granted the request. The Associated Press, Honolulu Star-Advertiser and other media objected, urging the judge not to limit the public\'s right to court access without following proper procedures. \nAt a hearing last month, when lawyers representing the media were prepared to argue against closing the courtroom, Sing withdrew the motion, saying his concerns could be addressed without closing the entire proceeding. That allowed the hearing to move forward in open court. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Morgan Early argued that he should be held without bail because he\'s a danger to the community and suffers from a "major mental illness." Mansfield ruled that he was competent for trial and must be held without bail. \nTuesday\'s hearing was delayed by about two hours because Engin Turkalp, a Turkish interpreter, was late. When the hearing finally got under way, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson abruptly left the bench and seemed frustrated over the Turkalp\'s apparent inability to effectively translate the proceeding. \nWhen Watson returned to the courtroom, he continued with the proceeding without using the interpreter and told Uskanli to use her if necessary. The lawyers in the case had requested the interpreter as a precaution even though Uskanli reads and understands English. \nUsklani\'s student visa had been revoked because he wasn\'t attending school, his immigration attorney Gary Singh said Tuesday. Uskanli faces deportation proceedings, but he plans to return to Turkey on his own, Singh said: "He just wants to go home. He\'s sick and wants to go home to get help." \nHe faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. But prosecutors don\'t expect to ask for more incarceration than what Uskanli has already served. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access.',

MATTHEW DALYAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Two of President Donald Trump\'s Cabinet members say they do not plan to reimburse the government for charter flights costing tens of thousands of dollars. \nRepresentatives of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt say the trips were pre-approved by ethics officials in their respective agencies and were part of their official duties. \nInspectors general for the two agencies have opened inquiries into the taxpayer-funded travel. \nZinke said he\'s taken three charter flights while in office, including a $12,375 late-night trip from Las Vegas to his home state of Montana in June. Zinke said no commercial flight was available when he planned to fly for a speech to Western governors. \nZinke also traveled by private plane in Alaska in May and to the U.S. Virgin Islands in March. The two trips cost a total of $7,000, the Interior Department said. \nThe EPA said four non-commercial flights taken by Pruitt were approved by ethics lawyers. Documents show Pruitt and his staff chartered a private plane for an Aug. 4 trip from Denver to Durango, Colorado, to visit the Gold King Mine, site of a spill last year. The administrator also took three flights on government-owned planes to New York, North Dakota and a roundtrip between airports in Pruitt\'s native Oklahoma. \nLetters released by EPA show the flights cost a total of $58,000 and were approved by the agency\'s general counsel\'s office. \n"If a reimbursement was necessary for official government travel, the EPA\'s Ethics Office would have told us during the approval process and we would\'ve acted accordingly," said EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman. \nHeather Swift, a spokeswoman for Zinke, said Tuesday all of Zinke\'s travel- including a military flight with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to view wildfires in Montana in August - were approved by career officials at the department. \n"As with previous (Interior) secretaries, Secretary Zinke\'s travel is paid for by the government," Swift said. \nMeanwhile, the independent Office of Special Counsel said it is investigating a complaint that Zinke\'s speech to a Las Vegas hockey team may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits executive branch officials from engaging in political activities. The team\'s owner contributed to Zinke\'s congressional campaigns and to Trump\'s inauguration. \nA watchdog group, the Campaign for Accountability, filed the complaint last week. \n"Rather than putting America first, Zinke is putting a top donor first," said Daniel Stevens, the group\'s executive director. \nThe Office of Special Counsel investigates whistleblower complaints involving federal employees. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Michael Biesecker contributed to this story.',

The president said he will meet with FEMA and military officials, first responders, and the people of Puerto Rico. Additionally, he said the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands will “probably” travel to Puerto Rico to meet with him. Trump will be accompanied on the trip by first lady Melania Trump . The president’s trip comes amid some criticism over the federal government’s response to the island twice hit by a hurricane in the past month. The president has repeatedly defended the federal response. “It’s been amazing what’s been done in a very short period of time on Puerto Rico,” the president said in the Oval Office Monday. It’s unclear whether the president will meet with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, whom the president accused of “poor leadership” in a barrage of tweets over the weekend.',

(AP) — The U.S. Department of Justice sued Loveland-based Crop Production Services, claiming the company refused to hire at least three workers because they are U.S. citizens and instead hired foreign temporary workers. \nThe Reporter-Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/2fHv1XM ) the lawsuit, filed Thursday, alleges Crop Production Services violated the Immigration and Nationality Act by showing preference to noncitizens under the H-2A visa program. \nThe Justice Department\'s complaint says Crop Production Services discriminated against at least three U.S. citizens who were applying for jobs last year as seasonal technicians at the company\'s rice-breeding facility in El Campo, Texas. \nIn an email Monday, Crop Production Services said it couldn\'t comment. \n——— \nInformation from: Loveland Daily Reporter-Herald, http://www.reporterherald.com/ \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

    text: 'Arizona State journalism school, Facebook fight fake news Posted: # Comments \nPHOENIX (AP)  Arizona State University\'s journalism school has partnered with Facebook on a project to increase news literacy and combat false news. \nThe Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication launched a news laboratory Tuesday that will work with news organizations to fight the proliferation of misinformation. \nThe project is funded by Facebook, which has come under criticism for its handling of fake articles that circulated widely on many social media platforms during the presidential election last year. Facebook recently launched a notification on its site that helps users spot false news. \nIt\'s born out of a meeting earlier this year of news literacy experts from around the world who gathered to discuss how to better educate the public on distinguishing between false and accurate news. Advertisement \nAt the Cronkite school, professors and students will run a lab that will work with news organizations and communities around the country. \n"I think the elections not only in the United States but also in England, in other places, have put a focus on the reach and power of completely fabricated stories. And those of us who work in the news literacy arena, we\'re having a crisis point," said Eric Newton, the lab\'s co-founder. \nNewton gave the example of a Phoenix rally earlier this year in which a photo of a massive crowd circulated and was falsely reported as depicting spectators waiting for President Donald Trump. The photo was of a crowd in 2016 waiting to celebrate the Cleveland Cavaliers, which had just won an NBA championship. \nNewton says the lab at the Cronkite school will focus on collaborating with teachers, librarians and news organizations to find best practices for not only detecting false news but finding credible sources. The first major organization that the lab is partnering with is McClatchy, a major publisher with 30 media companies. \nThe move follows a partnership Facebook announced in December with several news organizations  including The Associated Press  to fact check stories posted on the social media network that a large number of people flag as possibly fake.',

    text: 'Orange County News ‘I felt very helpless,’ veteran Riverside officer says after witnessing Las Vegas shooting   Shea and Jennifer McMahon, of Riverside, pose at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas. They later had to run for their lives as Stephen Paddock fired on the crowd from the Mandalay Bay hotel on Oct. 1, 2017. (Courtesy of Shea McMahon) By Brian Rokos | brokos@scng.com | The Press-Enterprise October 3, 2017 at 7:01 pm Shea McMahon, a Riverside police officer, usually runs to danger while others scramble in the opposite direction.\nBut the massacre in Las Vegas during the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Sunday, Oct. 1, was anything but usual.\nSo McMahon, 41, who attended the concert with his wife, Jennifer, 39, and brother-in-law and sister-in-law, made sure they all ran for cover as he watched shooting victims drop around them. None of the four was among the more than 500 injured or killed.\n“I felt very helpless,” McMahon, a 16-year veteran of law enforcement, said Tuesday, Oct. 3, as he returned to patrol. McMahon said he thought talking about his ordeal would make him feel better and that climbing back into his familiar black-and-white would make him feel comfortable.\n“Normally, you’re in this job, and something happens, and you have the tools to fight back. Not knowing where the actual shooting was coming from, there was nothing I could fight back with,” said McMahon, who repeated the word “helpless” several times in the interview.\n“Maybe if I was there by myself, or with my buddies, it might have been different,” he said.\nInstead, his first instinct after hearing automatic gunfire was to throw himself on top of his wife after she went to the ground to protect herself. McMahon’s brother-in-law, a Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, did the same to shield his wife.\nAll four are country music fans and regularly attend the Stagecoach Festival in Indio and other concerts. Over the weekend, the couples were celebrating their wedding anniversaries.\nThey had places about 25 yards from the stage where Jason Aldean was performing when the shooting began.\nMcMahon didn’t cover his wife for long after the women in front of them and behind them had been shot.\n“I said ‘Somebody is shooting. We have to get out of here.’ If we were on the ground, we were sitting ducks,” McMahon said. “Seeing people getting shot in the leg and the back and the head, I was preparing to be shot like them.”\nAs they ran toward the exit, others continued to fall beside them. Some were trampled.\n“The noise was just deafening,” he said. “It felt like he was in the venue, chasing us down. It felt like we were being hunted.”\nThey ran to an apartment complex, where someone ushered them into a room. The couples called their families. The McMahons thought about their son, who turned 14 on Monday, and their daughter, 11.\nJennifer then   back of Shea’s shirt was stained with someone else’s dried blood.\n“We’re lucky to be alive,” Shea McMahon said. “It’s a miracle; the grace of God.”',

Kathora is the same village for which Rahul had visited the office of the National Highway Authority of India in Lucknow two months ago with farmers alleging discrepancies in compensation given to them in exchange for land being acquired for a road project. At the ‘chaupal’, Rahul will “listen to grievances” of the farmers.\nOn October 5, the Congress leader will interact with the public at the Munshiganj guesthouse and later meet party workers at Rajiv Gandhi Degree College in Amethi. He will also visit several areas in Salon Vidhan Sabha constituency, after which he will travel to Rae Bareli. There, he will stay the night at the Bhuvemau guesthouse. On October 6, he will meet with locals before returning to New Delhi.\nThis will be Rahul’s first visit to Amethi after Congress suffered a major loss in the state Assembly elections around six months ago. The visit also holds significance as BJP national president Amit Shah and a host of Union ministers are set to camp in Rahul’s constituency on October 10 for the inaugurations of some development projects.\nOn September 30, the Amethi district administration had in a letter to Rahul requested him to change the date of his visit, expressing difficulty in providing him security as police personnel were already deployed to maintain law and order during Durga Puja and Moharram.\nHowever, the dates of the visit were not changed. “After issuing the advisory, the district administration is now saying that their intention was misunderstood. They have said that they would now provide security,” said Dubey.\nYogesh Kumar, District Magistrate, Amethi told The Indian Express, “We have been informed about his (Rahul’s) three-day visit and will provide him security. First of all, security was never denied to him. The district administration can never deny security to a Member of Parliament. We had just requested him to shift his visit because of ongoing festive season and deployment of police force elsewhere. Police force has also come from adjoining districts for Durga visarjan and other arrangements.”\nFor all the latest India',

    text: '3.10.17 Las #Vegas Gunman May Have First Planned to Attack Chance the Rapper concert LAS VEGAS—The gunman who murdered at least 59 people at a country-music concert on Sunday might have originally targeted another Las Vegas music festival held the previous weekend, according to a senior law enforcement source. Stephen Paddock rented multiple condos overlooking the annual Life Is Beautiful Festival, which this year was headlined by Lorde and Chance the Rapper, said the source, who is not directly involved in the investigation but has been briefed on its progress. In an effort to confirm the report, The Daily Beast visited the Ogden, a 21-story luxury condominium tower with a line of sight to the concert-grounds.“We\'re not in a position to confirm or deny anything about Mr. Paddock\'s dealings. I suggest you contact Metro [police]. As you know this is an on going investigation,” said Melissa Warren, public affairs officer for Fais Foley Warren, owner of the Ogden. The source suggested that Paddock may have lost his nerve or simply changed his plans and checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on September 28. He then took a suite overlooking the Route 91 Harvest Festival and opened fire on an estimated 20,000 concertgoers below. Law enforcement recovered 23 weapons from the suite, including several rifles capable of automatic fire. Paddock concealed the arsenal in 10 suitcases, Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told reporters. Law enforcement discovered at least 19 firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and an explosive at his home in Mesquite, Nevada. The bomb-making chemical ammonium nitrate was also found in his car, police said. at',

Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State last Friday suspended Mr Augustine Eze, Headmaster, Community Primary School, Amazu, Ishielu Local Government Area of the state and seven other teachers for absenteeism. Umahi, who paid an unscheduled visit to the school directed the suspended teachers to report to the chairman of the local government, Mr Henry Eze. He further directed that the council chairman should refer them to the Chairman of the state Universal Basic Education,(UBEB) for more disciplinary actions. He gave N300,000 cash to the 15 teachers present during the visit to change their wardrobe, expressing dissatisfaction with the way they dressed. The governor engaged them in an academic exercise, drilling them in English Language and Mathematics. He condemned the nonchalant attitude of some civil servants in the State and warned that the state government would no longer tolerate their conduct of workers who were not committed to the duties.“It is very unfortunate the way and manner some of our civil servants do their jobs without passion.“We have called for change in our attitude and perception of what we refer to as government property.“It is absurd that pupils will be in the school and the school’s headmaster and teachers will brazenly be absent.“We shall not take this anymore and the headmaster and the absentee teachers are hereby suspended.“They are directed to report to the chairman of the local government area who will take them to the UBEB chairman; they must be transferred after serving their suspension,” Umahi said. He urged the teachers present during his visit to double their efforts and use the money he gave them to buy new clothes and look neat and smart before their pupils. Our correspondent reports that the elated teachers and pupils chanted solidarity songs as the convoy of the governor left the school. SHARE',

  text: 'Email Text Drews Finishes First Season with USA Annie Drews was a standout contributor in her first season with USA Oct. 3,   The end of summer marks the conclusion of USA Volleyball\'s season and the end of perhaps the most exciting chapter in Annie Drews\' volleyball career. Following her MVP season in which she led Caquas Criollas to the Puerto Rican title, she received an invite to train with Team USA and did not disappoint from the moment she arrived in Anaheim, California. Over the course of three tournament appearances and a pair of friendly competitions against Brazil, Drews proved to be one of the top offensive options for the Americans. Beginning with the Pan American Cup in June, Drews led Team USA to its 16th Pan Am Cup in Canete, Peru. The Americans won all seven of their matches defeating Venezuela, Columbia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The Elkhart, Indiana, native hit .370 with 54 kills on 108 swings to lead the United States in hitting percentage and finish tied for the second most kills on the team. After her dominant effort in the Pan Am Cup, she was left off the Grand Prix roster to begin the tournament, allowing her to go back to Anaheim, California, and train in the Team USA system. However, in need of more offense, Team USA added Drews to the FIVB World Grand Prix Final Six roster and she delivered. Despite USA falling in both of its matches in the final six, Drews led the Americans with 25 kills on 65 attempts in six sets of action. Of USA\'s top three point scorers in the finals, Drews was the only player to come off the bench. She appeared in six of a possible nine sets and registered the second most points on the team with 26 to her credit. Following her two tournaments abroad, she finally sported the red, white and blue in her home country as Team USA hosted Brazil in the USA Volleyball Cup. In front of family, friends and Team USA fanatics, Drews posted two of her best efforts in a USA uniform. In back-to-back contests, the right side hitter torched Brazil for 36 points in just six sets of action. USA defeated Brazil in its first match in three sets and chose to play a bonus set, allowing Drews to rack up 21 points with 14 kills, three blocks and an ace coming in the official three sets. The lefty came off the bench in the second match to lead the United States with 12 kills on 21 attempts with just three errors along with three blocks and an ace in just two sets of action. Drews finished her rookie season with USA in the FIVB World Grand Champions Cup in which she helped the Americans to a bronze medal with wins over Korea, Russia and the tournament\'s host, Japan. She finished with the second most points on USA\'s roster, eighth most points in the tournament and just one point shy of her teammate Jordan Larson who took home the Best Spiker Award as part of the tournament\'s Dream Team. Drews posted 69 points with 58 kills, nine blocks and two aces over the course of five matches. Altogether, Purdue\'s all-american alumna appeared in 55 sets for the United States and terminated 164 of her 381 attempts with 57 errors giving her a .281 hitting percentage and a 2.98 kills per set average. She complemented her scoring efforts with 23 blocks and six aces as well. While enjoying her success with Team USA, Drews signed with SASB Volleyball Legano in Italy\'s Serie A2 to continue her professional volleyball career and prepare for her next season with Team USA.',

    text: 'Apple Valley man arrested after attacking elderly couple during robbery Friday Tuesday Oct 3, 2017 at 5:45 PM Oct 3, 2017 at 5:45 PM Staff Reports \nAPPLE VALLEY — Authorities arrested a 46-year-old man accused of breaking into a home and attacking an elderly couple early Friday. \nAlbert Jermaine Johnson, of Apple Valley, was arrested following the incident, which occurred at a home in the 21000 block of Highway 18 Friday morning. \nSan Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials stated Tuesday that deputies were first dispatched to the home at 12:28 a.m. after receiving reports of a residential robbery in progress. \n“The adult male victim was awakened by the sound of breaking glass and when he got up to see where the noise was coming from he saw a black male, later identified as Albert Johnson, walking past the broken window,” sheriff’s officials said. \nJohnson allegedly attacked the couple after the victim told his wife to call 911, causing “significant injury” to both. Officials said he stopped the attack and then barricaded himself in a bedroom when he saw lights from a deputy’s patrol car. \n“Deputies entered the residence and forced entry into the bedroom where the suspect was hiding,” officials said. “After a brief struggle, the suspect was arrested without further incident.” \nThe victims were able to flee before the standoff, officials said, and were taken to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary for treatment of their injuries. Further updates on their condition weren’t available Tuesday. \nJohnson was arrested on suspicion of robbery, false imprisonment, and causing harm or death to an elder or dependent adult. He appeared in court Tuesday, where prosecutors charged him with second-degree robbery, with additional enhancements for using a deadly weapon and causing a grave bodily injury. \nJohnson plead not guilty to the charge Tuesday, as well as denying all enhancements, court records show. Prosecutors also set his bail at $400,000. Johnson remains in custody at the West Valley Detention Center. About Us',

While Ayers was pessimistic about the GOP’s ability to pass comprehensive tax reform, he maintained that going into the elections without having passed at least one major legislative goal would be a “suicide mission.” \nWealthy donors provide a huge chunk of the funding for campaigns. Though the 2016 election saw a rise in the number of small donations to candidates, these contributions remain tiny in comparison to a number of money donors like those at the St. Regis event give. \nSource: Pulse Subscribe to our mailing list Related Posts:',

    text: 'Call to businesses to support £100K challenge to fund Cambridge cancer scientists Call to businesses to support £100K challenge to fund Cambridge cancer scientists 4/10/2017 BUSINESSES in Cambridge are being urged to help beat cancer by supporting a ground-breaking research project that’s taking place in the city. \nScientists and doctors in Cambridge, who are funded by Cancer Research UK, are testing a revolutionary imaging technique at Addenbrooke’s that could show whether a cancer drug is working or not within a day or two of treatment starting. \nThis is exciting, innovative research that is expensive to carry out. That’s why Cancer Research UK and the Cambridge Independent are joining forces to set the city’s businesses a challenge – can we raise £100k in 12 months to fund this local research? \nThis is a chance for you and your employees to get behind something linked directly to cancer research in Cambridge. The lead researchers on the trial are Professor Kevin Brindle and Dr Ferdia Gallagher. Since 2013, they have been working together to develop a new type of MRI scan that can be used to spot when cancers first start responding to treatment. \nProfessor Brindle and Dr Gallagher were the first in Europe to test this ground-breaking technique in patients, and they are continuing their work at Addenbrooke’s Hospital right now. Their imaging research* involves patients who are being treated for a wide range of cancer types. \nThe money raised through this fundraising campaign will be used to fund a research project which aims to determine if a breast cancer drug is working for patients. \nIt’s thought the drug will work for some patients, but not others. By using this new imaging technique, the research group aims to determine as quickly as possible which patients it does work for. \nThe funding would cover the cost of materials, research in the lab and help to develop this revolutionary imaging technique. \nHeidi Connell, Cancer Research UK’s Senior Local Fundraising Manager, said: “This is a one off opportunity to support a research project which could have a big impact on those around you and on future generations. \n“We are very excited to have this research going on in Cambridge. If it’s successful, this new imaging technique could change how we treat patients in the future. \n“Improvements and developments in technology like this have the potential to give each cancer patient a better chance of surviving their disease. It’s this type of intelligent, innovative thinking that’s going to help us accelerate progress and beat cancer sooner. So please get behind the appeal and support this local research.” \nRight now, doctors use the size of a tumour to determine if a treatment is working or not. If it stops growing or starts shrinking, then treatment’s classified as working. If the tumour doesn’t shrink or stop growing, treatment’s classed as having failed. \nBut Professor Brindle and Dr Gallagher don’t believe this is the most accurate or fastest way of monitoring if treatment is working. Instead, they believe measuring the chemical activity of tumour cells would be better. \nThis is because cancer cells that are responding to treatment shut down and die quickly, meaning their chemical activity is lower than cells that aren’t responding to treatment. \nCurrently, patients must wait for weeks or months to find out if a treatment is working or not. But doctors believe this wait is too long. \nThe hope is that the new technique will speed up this process and ultimately, be used to help more people with all types of cancer get the treatment that’s right for them faster. \nIt could also be used to identify which patients should stop taking drugs that aren’t working for them, allowing them to try different ones and receive the best treatment for their cancer sooner. \nProfessor Kevin Brindle, co-lead based at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, said: “We’re very excited to be the first group to test this technique in patients and we hope that it will soon improve treatment – and put an end to giving patients treatments that don’t work for them, along with unpleasant side effects that accompany them. Each person’s cancer is different and this technique could help us tailor a patient’s treatment faster than ever.” \nDr Ferdia Gallagher, co-lead also funded by Cancer Research UK and based at the Department of Radiology at the University of Cambridge, said: “It’s fantastic that we are able to try this technique in patients. We hope this will progress the way cancer treatment is given and make therapy more effective for patients in the future. This new technique could potentially mean that doctors will find out much more quickly if a treatment is working for their patient instead of waiting to see if a tumour shrinks.” \nFor more information on how to get involved and how your business will benefit, please email: \nTo support the trial visit: www.justgiving.com/fundraising/cambridgeresearchproject \nAbout Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute \nThe Cambridge Institute turns 10 this year.

    text: 'Email Text Drews Finishes First Season with USA Annie Drews was a standout contributor in her first season with USA Oct. 3,   The end of summer marks the conclusion of USA Volleyball\'s season and the end of perhaps the most exciting chapter in Annie Drews\' volleyball career. Following her MVP season in which she led Caquas Criollas to the Puerto Rican title, she received an invite to train with Team USA and did not disappoint from the moment she arrived in Anaheim, California. Over the course of three tournament appearances and a pair of friendly competitions against Brazil, Drews proved to be one of the top offensive options for the Americans. Beginning with the Pan American Cup in June, Drews led Team USA to its 16th Pan Am Cup in Canete, Peru. The Americans won all seven of their matches defeating Venezuela, Columbia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The Elkhart, Indiana, native hit .370 with 54 kills on 108 swings to lead the United States in hitting percentage and finish tied for the second most kills on the team. After her dominant effort in the Pan Am Cup, she was left off the Grand Prix roster to begin the tournament, allowing her to go back to Anaheim, California, and train in the Team USA system. However, in need of more offense, Team USA added Drews to the FIVB World Grand Prix Final Six roster and she delivered. Despite USA falling in both of its matches in the final six, Drews led the Americans with 25 kills on 65 attempts in six sets of action. Of USA\'s top three point scorers in the finals, Drews was the only player to come off the bench. She appeared in six of a possible nine sets and registered the second most points on the team with 26 to her credit. Following her two tournaments abroad, she finally sported the red, white and blue in her home country as Team USA hosted Brazil in the USA Volleyball Cup. In front of family, friends and Team USA fanatics, Drews posted two of her best efforts in a USA uniform. In back-to-back contests, the right side hitter torched Brazil for 36 points in just six sets of action. USA defeated Brazil in its first match in three sets and chose to play a bonus set, allowing Drews to rack up 21 points with 14 kills, three blocks and an ace coming in the official three sets. The lefty came off the bench in the second match to lead the United States with 12 kills on 21 attempts with just three errors along with three blocks and an ace in just two sets of action. Drews finished her rookie season with USA in the FIVB World Grand Champions Cup in which she helped the Americans to a bronze medal with wins over Korea, Russia and the tournament\'s host, Japan. She finished with the second most points on USA\'s roster, eighth most points in the tournament and just one point shy of her teammate Jordan Larson who took home the Best Spiker Award as part of the tournament\'s Dream Team. Drews posted 69 points with 58 kills, nine blocks and two aces over the course of five matches. Altogether, Purdue\'s all-american alumna appeared in 55 sets for the United States and terminated 164 of her 381 attempts with 57 errors giving her a .281 hitting percentage and a 2.98 kills per set average. She complemented her scoring efforts with 23 blocks and six aces as well. While enjoying her success with Team USA, Drews signed with SASB Volleyball Legano in Italy\'s Serie A2 to continue her professional volleyball career and prepare for her next season with Team USA.',

Hawaii News Now via AP, File) FILE - In this May 19, 2017, file image made from video provided by Hawaii News Now, Anil Uskanli is driven away from the airport in the back of a sheriff\'s car in Honolulu after being detained on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Turkish man accused of causing a flight disturbance the prompted fighter jets to escort the plane to its Honolulu destination is scheduled to plead guilty Tuesday, Oct. 3. Hawaii News Now via AP, File) Man in flight disturbance case was hallucinating butterfly By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER Associated Press October 03, 2017 9:02 PM HONOLULU \nA Turkish man pleaded guilty Tuesday to interfering with a flight crew and blamed his inflight behavior that prompted fighter jets to escort the plane to its Honolulu destination on hallucinating that he was chasing a butterfly. \nA butterfly suddenly came out of the front pocket of the seat in front of him, Anil Uskanli said in a Honolulu federal court Tuesday in describing what he did during the May 19 American Airlines flight from Los Angeles. "The butterfly went crazy ... flew into the toilet," he said. "I followed it. I tried to kill it by punching it." \nUskanli, 25, said he now realizes that he was ill and hallucinating. \nTo flight crew and passengers, Uskanli\'s behavior was concerning, including when he walked to the front of the plane with a blanket wrapped around his head and carrying a laptop crew members feared contained explosives, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Brady said. \nAfter Uskanli returned to his seat and with an off-duty officer sitting with him, the laptop remained on a drink cart, which prompted the captain to initiate bomb-threat procedures, Brady said. \nThe Hawaii National Guard scrambled two fighter jets to escort the plane to Honolulu. The secretary of Homeland Security was briefed. \nUskanli raised other red flags while still at Los Angeles International Airport, but experts said a lack of communication and an airline\'s hesitancy to be caught on video booting a passenger played a role in allowing him to fly. In April, a United Airlines incident in which a passenger was dragged off an overcrowded plane drew widespread attention. \nUskanli had purchased a ticket at an airline counter in the middle of the night with no luggage and was arrested ahead of the flight to Hawaii after opening a door to a restricted airfield. Airport police said he smelled of alcohol but was not intoxicated enough to be charged with public drunkenness, so he was given a citation and released. \nAfter the flight landed in Honolulu and Uskanli was arrested, a judge ordered a mental competency evaluation at the request of his defense attorney. He was sent to a federal detention facility in Los Angeles to undergo the evaluation. \nWhen Uskanli returned to Honolulu, defense attorney Richard Sing tried to have a hearing on his mental competency and detention closed to the public. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kenneth Mansfield initially granted the request. The Associated Press, Honolulu Star-Advertiser and other media objected, urging the judge not to limit the public\'s right to court access without following proper procedures. \nAt a hearing last month, when lawyers representing the media were prepared to argue against closing the courtroom, Sing withdrew the motion, saying his concerns could be addressed without closing the entire proceeding. That allowed the hearing to move forward in open court. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Morgan Early argued that he should be held without bail because he\'s a danger to the community and suffers from a "major mental illness." Mansfield ruled that he was competent for trial and must be held without bail. \nTuesday\'s hearing was delayed by about two hours because Engin Turkalp, a Turkish interpreter, was late. When the hearing finally got under way, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson abruptly left the bench and seemed frustrated over the Turkalp\'s apparent inability to effectively translate the proceeding. \nWhen Watson returned to the courtroom, he continued with the proceeding without using the interpreter and told Uskanli to use her if necessary. The lawyers in the case had requested the interpreter as a precaution even though Uskanli reads and understands English. \nUsklani\'s student visa had been revoked because he wasn\'t attending school, his immigration attorney Gary Singh said Tuesday. Uskanli faces deportation proceedings, but he plans to return to Turkey on his own, Singh said: "He just wants to go home. He\'s sick and wants to go home to get help." \nHe faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. But prosecutors don\'t expect to ask for more incarceration than what Uskanli has already served. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access.',
